This is, to a large extent, for obvious reasons. The intensity of pressure on retail in the UK, with added operating issues in North America, rose over 2017, and the market, which was initially optimistic like the company (we were not), turned around and against the stock. However, a structurally doomed outlook is not a reason to not find any entry level into a utility, because this is what the utilities world is about from a structural perspective: we see the entire utility value chain under increasing pressure over the coming two decades. Equity valuation in that context is valuing the remaining life of an operation or asset.

The meeting also confirmed our view that the impact of the long-term guarantee review by the EIOPA is unlikely to lead to a significant negative impact on the solvency II ratio of Dutch insurance and that the overall impact will be manageable for the sector. We believe that the underperformance of Dutch insurers is likely to reverse in 2020, as a ‘manageable’ outcome of the LTG review is confirmed. Our base case for the Dutch insurance sector is that: 1) the UFR curve is likely to evaluate into the ‘alternative method’ prescribed by the EIOPA (which is DNB’s most preferred option) rather than leading to a more aggressive revision of the last liquid point; 2) the change in the volatility adjustment is unlikely to have a significant impact on the sector.

Given that crop prices have significantly improved in late 2020, do you see the potential to raise your guidance at the H1 2020/21 report? If not – what drives your cautiousness? 
Sugar beets is your most important segment, having generated 38% of sales in the past fiscal year, but 124% of EBIT. You have a sizable global market share of c. 60% in sugar beet seeds. What are the challenges this business is facing (less sugar consumption, etc.)? 
In sugar, do you see any implications in terms of changing trade conditions (trade barriers) with the new political landscape (new US government), and would that favour white sugar (from sugar beets) versus brown sugar (from sugar cane)? 
Can you explain the impact higher crop prices have on your Corn and Cereals segments? Or would you say demand tends to be stable irrespective of crop pricing? 
Some of your competitors seem to be rather advanced in their plans to introduce hybrid wheat – which for the No. 2 global crop (after corn) would be quite a revolution. Where are you with your hybrid wheat project? Is the key problem still hybrid vigour (i.e., it is technically possible to breed hybrid wheat, but the “F1” hybrid itself does not have a higher yield than the parent generation? 
Your 50/50 joint venture with Vilmorin in the US, AgReliant, has a market share of c. 6% in US corn, competing against the dominant players Bayer and Corteva. Do you believe this business is gaining traction due to higher crop prices in this season? 
You spent more than EUR400m in 2019 to acquire Pop Vriend, a Dutch-based vegetable seeds business mainly concentrating on spinach. This represented an EV/sales multiple of c. 4.5x at the time. Management also indicated in the wake of this acquisition that more was to come, as KWS Saat is aiming for 5% global market share in the c. EUR5bn vegetable seeds market. Hence, there is still c. EUR175m of sales to be built up – via organic growth and perhaps via acquisitions. Is that a correct observation? If this sales level were to be acquired at the multiples that have been paid for similar deals (including Pop Vriends), issuing new equity would be unavoidable – is that correct? 
Please explain the role the pool of family shareholders plays in the day-to-day operations of KWS Saat. 
Two years ago, KWS changed from the legal form of “SE” to a KGaA, giving the pooled families the power to not dilute their voting rights even if a larger equity issuance were to come. Why was this step necessary from your perspective? 
Your newly acquired vegetable seeds activities lost c. 50% of sales in calendar Q3 2020. Is this solely to blame on less appetite for spinach?

The Thai project can potentially be expanded beyond 100kt at some point. What would be the incremental capex, how much additional capacity could come, and what time frame are we talking about? 
The other – even bigger – project is LD Cellulose (LDC), where Lenzing holds a 51% share and Brazilian partner Duratex a 49% share.

The transaction is subject to the completion of required regulatory approvals. Is this more of a formality or are there risks of any redemptions?  
The current production of paper board at Kotka Mills is about 260kt but the capacity is 400kt. When could full capacity be reached and how many synergies could be created through this acquisition?  
The balance sheet will remain strong following the closure of the Kotka Mills transaction, enabling more acquired growth. Are there more interesting acquisition opportunities available and is there enough management and organisational capacity for additional acquisitions?  
Some smaller closures have recently been announced.

But what are the key lessons for adidas even though it might still be too early for a final conclusion? Given that adidas is in the process of defining an updated strategy for the mid- to long term, where does management feel that it needs to be better protected from such external effects and is there potentially the need to review the supply chain, logistics, manufacturing, or product development process?  
Two core themes are driving the consumer sector: digitalisation and ESG-related topics. Adidas is already quite advanced in both areas, but where does the company still have white spots that have to be addressed?  
It seems as if the sporting goods sector has restructured and adjusted all areas of its business model over the last few decades. However, the structure of the supply chain with the manufacturing process in Asia and shipment to consumer markets has not materially changed.

The acquisition of Woowa in South Korea has been approved by the KFTC.

The condition for the approval of the Woowa acquisition to sell Yogiyo certainly came as a surprise to many. For Delivery Hero, what would be a “good” or “bad” outcome of the disposal process? 
The overall sector is characterised by very active M&A. Neither debt nor equity financing represent stumbling blocks, and hence both start-up business models and M&A to increase scale are seen around the world.

In its Q4 2019 Q&A session dated January 30 2020, the company stated that “everything is ready to go” with regards to a potential spin-off of Stolt Tankers.

Saada argues (reasonably, in our view) that the value of lot 3 was inflated by the fact that the first two lots had already been attributed to Mediapro, who was grossly overpaying for their value (EUR870m per season), especially given the increasingly limited appeal of a lop-sided Ligue 1 even in the home country and evidence of a peak in the value sports rights elsewhere (Sky in the UK), provoking panic bidding by those likely to be excluded, including BeIN Sports, who had also previously lost their Champions League rights to SFR/RMC.  
Saada believes that Canal has been badly treated by the league in recent years, which litigates against finding a commercial agreement to take over Mediapro’s rights without an auction, which Canal believes in any case would be legally untenable. 
Canal’s tough stance is to be applauded and is very much what Vivendi shareholders want to see, in our view.",EQAOC_892928.pdf,14.68%,FALSE,60,,,VIV FP,VIV FP,France,Europe,1/14/2021 8:33

Moreover, the company raised its EBITDA margin guidance for 2020, implying EBITDA of around CHF926m for last year, which is above our and consensus estimates by c. 3% and c. 5%, respectively. 
It is worth noting that market prices for raw materials increased on average by c. 11% in Q4 vs Q3, prompting us to expect a clear double-digit rise for 2021, which compares with a likely year-on-year decline of around 3-4% for Geberit in 2020, according to our estimates. Assuming that this is not yet fully reflected in the consensus, we expect consensus EPS numbers to rise by less than 6-7%, as would have been indicated by Q4 sales above market expectations and the higher EBITDA margin guidance for 2020. 
Given the strong rise of Geberit’s share price over the past few weeks, probably also on the emerging signs of strength in Q4 demand in spite of the pandemic, it is difficult to forecast today’s share price reaction, as we could envisage both profit taking on good news as well as a further increase following today’s clear beat of market expectations.
