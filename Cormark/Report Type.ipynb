      "Building on encouraging preliminary results from last year’s metallurgical test work, Crawford’s second lock cycle test has produced additional (very) high-grade nickel concentrate (+45%—well above a current PEA target of 35%) on the back of improved nickel recoveries (+60%, versus a PEA LOM average of 37% [including 50% during the first 3.5 years of operation]). Recent results further reaffirm ongoing flowsheet improvement efforts (reagent, grind size, and magnetic separation ‘positioning’ focused). Said optimization efforts form part of the metallurgical variability testing for Crawford’s FS (Q4/22 targeted completion; broad range of samples still to be tested; recoveries anticipated to span 30-60+%), which is expected to deliver meaningful improvements in nickel recovery (i.e., potentially [likely] more than a previously set target of 4-5 percentage points; each percentage point would yield US$92 MM of incremental value to Crawford’s PEA NAV8%, which is currently headlined by an after-tax figure of US$1,187 MM).\n",

Of greater importance, and the driver behind the subsequent 39% sell-off on Thursday, was the increase in the Magino capex to C$920 MM (from C$800 MM in December 2021) and the lack of a solution to the current funding shortfall (we estimate it is now in the $300-350 MM range). The higher capex estimate for Magino reduces our NAV to C$4.50 (from C$5.50). We are reducing our target price to C$2.70 (from C$4.00) on the back of the NAV decrease (to C$4.50 from C$5.50) and a cut to our target multiple to 0.60x NAV (from 0.75x NAV).

We have pushed the closing of the Spin acquisition into Q3/22. We are reducing our target from C$16.00 to C$12.00 as we have reduced our target EV/Revenue multiple from 2.5x to 2.0x given the general multiple contraction for the online gaming market and the overall market.

EPS of $0.14, while consensus was calling for revenue of $19.1 MM, adj. EBITDA of $8.1 MM and adj. EPS of $0.07. We note that the EBITDA miss to consensus was largely driven by higher-than-expected professional and G&A costs in combination with e-commerce revenue decline. E-commerce revenue in the month of March was up 38% and more importantly fitness revenue was only $800 K in Q2/21. Consequently, Management expects the drag on e-commerce revenue to be muted going forward and expects to deliver Y/Y growth in e-commerce revenue in subsequent quarters. We are revising our estimates to account for the quarter and the commentary provided by Management during the quarterly conference call. We believe that HomeTalk and Streamable acquisition was more weighted towards advertising revenue than we had initially anticipated. We are lowering our target from C$36.00 to C$28.50 as a result of our revisions as well as a slightly lower target multiple from 13.0x to 11.5x, given recent multiple compression in overall equity markets.

While BLDP’s Q1/22 results have felt the impact of inflation and to a lesser degree supply chain issues, the higher adj. EBITDA loss really reflects Management’s spending in advance of market development, a well-telegraphed strategy support by $1.1 B in cash.

As we have highlighted in our previous notes, we expect Rogers Wireless to be the primary beneficiary of the economic reopening and the return of international travel. We are also forecasting EBITDA growth to be in the low single-digit range largely driven by wireless. We are looking for consolidated revenue of $3.67 BB, up 4.8% Y/Y, adj. EBITDA of $1.44 BB, up 3.3%, and adj. dil. EPS of $0.83 vs $0.77 in Q4/20. We are largely in line with consensus, which is calling for consolidated revenue of $3.64 BB, adj.

We also note that the incumbent peer group (excluding Rogers) is now trading at an average multiple of 9.8x vs 9.5x.

      "We are making minor tweaks to our estimates on VerticalScope to incorporate Management commentary provided during the conference call. We are slightly lowering our top-line estimates for 2022 and lowering our EBITDA margin estimate by approximately 164 bps for the year. We remind investors that the company’s headcount increased from 252 in Q3/21 to 304 in Q4/21 as a result of the TheStreamable and Home Talk acquisitions. Consequently, we expect wages & consulting expense to remain high in Q1 and Q2 as Management cycles through the integration of these acquisitions and cut redundant costs. We are lowering our target on VerticalScope from C$41.00 previously to C$36.00 largely due to the expected near-term headwinds in e-commerce and the recently noted multiple contraction in tech equity valuations. Consequently, we are lowering our target EBITDA multiple from 15.0x previously to 13.0x on our 2023E. We continue to like Vertical Scope given its highly attractive valuation and sizable acquisition pipeline. Vertical Scope is currently trading at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 8.5x and 7.4x as well as FCF yields of 8% on 2022E and 2023E, respectively. We reiterate our Buy rating on Vertical Scope with a target price of C$36.00.\n",

We were looking for revenue of $113.4 MM, EBITDA of $20.4 MM and EPS of $0.31. The EBITDA miss was in iLottery, specifically its Michigan iLottery business as NPi was better than expected. Pollard gave a cautious outlook that stated that Lottery margins would be impacted by higher input costs that cannot be passed onto its customers. It is also facing challenges in its supply chain relating to transportation shipping product to customers and receiving supplies. Demand remains strong, and it is hoping that increased volume will offset lower margin. We are downgrading Pollard from Buy to Market Perform given the uncertain outlook.

In our opinion, this bodes well for BRAG, given the company's recent efforts to achieve geographic diversification of its revenue streams.
