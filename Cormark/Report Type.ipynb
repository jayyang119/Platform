The higher capex estimate for Magino reduces our NAV to C$4.50 (from C$5.50). We are reducing our target price to C$2.70 (from C$4.00) on the back of the NAV decrease (to C$4.50 from C$5.50) and a cut to our target multiple to 0.60x NAV (from 0.75x NAV).

We have pushed the closing of the Spin acquisition into Q3/22. We are reducing our target from C$16.00 to C$12.00 as we have reduced our target EV/Revenue multiple from 2.5x to 2.0x given the general multiple contraction for the online gaming market and the overall market.

E-commerce revenue in the month of March was up 38% and more importantly fitness revenue was only $800 K in Q2/21. Consequently, Management expects the drag on e-commerce revenue to be muted going forward and expects to deliver Y/Y growth in e-commerce revenue in subsequent quarters. We are revising our estimates to account for the quarter and the commentary provided by Management during the quarterly conference call. We believe that HomeTalk and Streamable acquisition was more weighted towards advertising revenue than we had initially anticipated. We are lowering our target from C$36.00 to C$28.50 as a result of our revisions as well as a slightly lower target multiple from 13.0x to 11.5x, given recent multiple compression in overall equity markets.

While BLDP’s Q1/22 results have felt the impact of inflation and to a lesser degree supply chain issues, the higher adj.

EBITDA for the quarter was approximately $2.8 MM. We are revising our estimates to account for the quarter and the commentary provided by Management during the quarterly conference call. Management noted that 65% of 2021 EBITDA was attributable to the cloud & colocation business, while the residual was attributable to the connectivity business. Consequently, we estimate that connectivity EBITDA was approximately $4.2 MM (incl. corporate expense) in 2021. We are also introducing our 2023E and forecasting a modest revenue growth of 1%. Given the aforementioned revisions and Management commentary resulting in downward revisions to our EBITDA estimates, we are lowering our target price from $5.40 previously to $5.20. We derive our target price by applying an EV/EBITDA multiple of 7.5x to our 2023E. Although some core operating metrics are pointing to an inflection point for the connectivity business, we recommend investors to stay on the sidelines. In our opinion, the company needs to deliver stable connectivity revenue for a few quarters for the market to truly believe that the business has stabilized.

We were looking for revenue of $113.4 MM, EBITDA of $20.4 MM and EPS of $0.31. The EBITDA miss was in iLottery, specifically its Michigan iLottery business as NPi was better than expected. Pollard gave a cautious outlook that stated that Lottery margins would be impacted by higher input costs that cannot be passed onto its customers. It is also facing challenges in its supply chain relating to transportation shipping product to customers and receiving supplies. Demand remains strong, and it is hoping that increased volume will offset lower margin. We are downgrading Pollard from Buy to Market Perform given the uncertain outlook. We are lowering our target from $46.50 to $35.00 given we have reduced our target multiple for Lottery from 14.0x to 10.0x.

Said reserve enhancement follows a recent resource update, underpinned by a 44.1 MMt inventory, further reaffirming McIlvenna Bay’s status as the largest undeveloped VMS system in the world-class Flin Flon Greenstone Belt. A modestly lower FS nameplate mill capacity (4,200 tpd versus our previously modelled 5,000 tpd figure), coupled with a higher initial capital cost estimate ($368 MM versus our previously modelled figure of $318 [US$250 MM; now US$300 MM]), has resulted in a decreased after-tax project NAV10% of US$341 MM (previously US$480 MM) at Cormark’s formal long-term metal price forecast.

      "Kinross has entered into a binding agreement to acquire Great Bear Resources for $1.8 B in cash or shares ($29.00 per share; $85 MM break fee)—representing a 30% premium to the explorco’s close on Tuesday and a 40% premium to its 20-day VWAP. While we view Kinross’ bid as compelling/attractive (16% premium to our previous $25.00 target price; see below), we would not be surprised to see other suitors enter into the equation given the Dixie Project’s Tier 1 potential in a Tier 1 jurisdiction—arguably a ‘must have’ asset. That said, in lieu of a competing offer, we have revised our recommendation to Tender, from Buy (S), and have increased our target price to $29.00 per share (from $25.00) as per Kinross’ bid consideration.\n",

Receipt of the permit marks a significant milestone in the mine's Phase 2 ramp-up to 230,000 oz Au/yr and paves the way for a potential Phase 3 expansion to 270,000 oz Au/yr. Jacobina is on pace to achieve the Phase 2 throughput objective of 8,500 tpd by Q2/22, at which point the mine will see production steadily increase to its planned 230,000 oz Au/yr run rate by 2023 — one year earlier than initially planned.

We were previously forecasting ARPU to be relatively flat to modestly growing at 1% for connectivity and are now forecasting an ARPU decline of 2% for Q4. We are also lowering our connectivity churn estimate for Q4 and 2021, given the YTD results and our expectation of the connectivity sub-base stabilizing relative to last year. Management also noted on its call that the churn of lower speeds subscriber is only slightly higher than ARPU accretive sub loading. Our cloud & colocation outlook largely remains unchanged. We expect the segment to be stable to modestly up. We are forecasting cloud & colocation revenue growth of 5% vs 2.5% in 2022, largely driven by higher ARPU and higher backlog MRR. We continue to believe that TGO is fairly valued at current price levels. In order for us to be bullish on TGO, we would need to see the connectivity business stabilize.

Recall that Q3/20 was an exceptionally strong quarter for the company, driven by the uptick in online shopping post pandemic related retail shutdowns across the world. FORA reported consolidated revenue of $14.0 MM, up 5%, adj. EBITDA of $5.6 MM and adj. dil EPS of -$0.08 vs -$0.11 in Q3/20. We were looking for consolidated revenue of $15.7 MM, adj.

We are revising our estimates to account for the quarter and the commentary provided by Management during the quarterly conference call. We have also accounted for Hometalk and The Streamable acquisition in our new estimates, given the sizable EBITDA contribution from these acquisitions. However, some of this growth in 2021 is being offset by lower organic growth within the e-commerce business. We were previously forecasting a 10% decline in e-commerce revenue in Q4/21 and a 9% decline for 2021, we are now forecasting a 37% decline for Q4/21 and a 15% decline in 2021. For 2022, we are raising our revenue and EBITDA estimates by approximately $24 MM and $12 MM, respectively to account for the aforementioned acquisitions. We are maintaining our target of C$41.00, given our 2023 estimates largely remain unchanged. We derive our target by applying an EV/EBITDA multiple of 15.0x to our 2023 estimates, given we are already at the end of 2022. We note that FORA continues to trade at an attractive valuation of 15.4x and 10.3x our 2021E and 2022E vs the peer group excluding Snap trading at forward multiples of 27.3x and 17.5x.

Due to continuous growth in digital games and entertainment revenue, this revenue stream is starting to make a meaningful contribution to the top line and represented approximately 20% of TOY’s total revenue.

We also note that growth in digital gaming revenue is also likely to persist given the recent MAU growth at Toca Boca Life and subscriber growth at Sago Mini.

      "Calibre reported another solid quarter, with EPS of $0.04 and CFPS of $0.08 in line with our estimates and consensus. The ramp-up at Pavon continues to progress well, delivering ore to the Libertad mill at a rate of 550 tpd (up 57% over Q1/21). Management expects this trend to continue into Q3/21, and states it is on pace to achieve its 1,000 tpd target by year-end. Given the accelerated advancement of Eastern Borosi (the next 'spoke' to feed the Libertad mill), Calibre is increasing its full year growth capital guidance by 27% to $45-50 MM and its exploration capital guidance by 16% to $17-19 MM. We continue to see the potential for upside to our estimates as Calibre’s aggressive drill program identifies additional feed for the Libertad mill.\n",

      "RF Capital released Q2/21 results last Friday with AUA up 20% Y/Y (and 10% YTD), fee-based revenue of $58.9 MM was up 21% Y/Y, effectively in line with our $60 MM forecast. Commission revenue of $10.1 MM was below our $11.7 MM forecast, but up an impressive 54% Y/Y. The miss on commission revenue and variability in other revenue categories resulted in total revenue of $79.1 MM being below our $84 MM estimate. On the earnings call, Management reiterated that there is a strong pipeline of advisory teams (representing ~$10 B of client assets) being pursued, with a high likelihood that several of the teams will be recruited through the autumn. RCG has built significant momentum YTD and we believe the investments in growth will help to sustain momentum over our forecast horizon. While our updated forecast assumes a more conservative AUA build, cost discipline translates into a 4% increase to 2022 EBITDA. We lower our target multiple by 1x to 11x 2022 EBITDA to add some conservatism given the heightened competitive environment and the fact that growth initiatives maytake several quarters to be impactful. Nonetheless, this translates into our target price rising to $3.40 from $3.30. We maintain our Buy recommendation.\n",

      "While emissions of commercial vehicles account for a third of the annual GHG emissions related to transportation, these class 4-8 trucks (buses, commercial vehicles, garbage, long haul etc.) are only 10% of the vehicle fleet, making them a more viable target for regulation. This will drive the market for alternatively fueled vehicles (NG, RNG, FC, EVs) from US$5 B mid-decade to US$30 B by 2030. While battery electric vehicles are best suited to dominate the passenger car market, larger commercial vehicles need the benefits of fuel cells to meet refueling, range, and payload demands. Loop Energy has developed fuel cell technology that could prove capable of fulfilling this need over the coming decade and we believe the company has the potential to achieve its goal of being a top tier suppler to the developing fuel cell mobility industry. We are initiating coverage on Loop with a Buy (S) rating and $9.50 target.\n",
