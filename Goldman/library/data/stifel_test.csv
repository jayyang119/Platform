ACLS US,ACLS,Dec 05 2021 02:18PM,"Axcelis Technologies, Inc.",Semiconductor Capital Equipment,Analyst Day Preview: Capitalizing on a Larger Market Opportunity and Driving Higher Earnings on New Target Model ,"On Thursday, Axcelis is scheduled to host an Analyst Day. We believe the analyst day will focuson three key areas, including 1) the total available ion implant market (which we believe has significantly grown), 2) the market opportunities for Axcelis (particularly at the mature nodes), and 3) a new financial target model. From a market perspective, we believe the overall ion implant market has displayed significant growth, and we expect an update on these market drivers. Along with that, one of the largest and fastest growth vectors has been on the mature technology node front, where not only productivity is needed but new materials engineering has become a greater focus. Here, Axcelis has made significant share gains over the last few years. Finally, we expect new financial model metrics, which will highlight not only higher top line growth, but more earnings growth as well. ","From a market perspective, we believe the ion implant market has seen some considerable growth. For many years, the total ion implant market was in a narrow range of $800 million to $1.1 billion (which moved as the cycles did). However, over the past few years, we have seen meaningful growth in the total ion implant market, where we estimate 2020 finished between $1.6B to $1.7B and we project 2021 to be as high as $2.0B+. Within the segments, high current remains the largest (at approximately 45-50% of the total ion implant market), driven by increasing intensity levels for advanced nodes. However, the fastest growing segment has been the high energy market, which has been greatly influenced by the growing needs of the mature technology node market. We estimate that this segment is now the second largest sub- segment within ion implant (overtaking medium current, which is being replaced by both high current and high energy that can be modified for traditional medium current applications). In addition to the market growth, we believe Axcelis has capitalized on emerging market opportunities, which has also been a key catalyst to its growth. We believe these market opportunities have been larger than originally forecasted and this aspect has been a driver for share gains. In particular, we believe management will address some of these larger market opportunities, and notably on the mature technology node end. While productivity is a key driver in greater intensity trends for ion implant, there are also new materials engineering and modification applications that are driving demand. We believe power semiconductors and image sensors are two markets that are driving better-than-expected growth in this segment. We believe Axcelis has positioned the company favorably with new product introductions over recent years and this should remain a key catalyst for its growth going forward. We expect management to introduce a new financial target model as it is on the cusp of exceeding its previously stated target of $650 million in revenue. Given the growth in the market and Axcelis’ opportunities, we could see future revenue targets in the $800 million/$1 billion/$1.2 billion ranges, particularly as WFE trends toward $100B and higher. We believe top line growth will come from both its systems business (driven by higher market and application growth), as well as its installed base business, which could see high single digit to 10% growth given the more rapid growth in systems. In general (excluding items like evaluation units), we believe gross margins can range in the mid-to-high 40s and operating margins can trend to the mid-20s (or higher at $1.2B or above). In total, we expect management to highlight both strong top line and margin expansion, leading to higher earnings growth in its new model. We will also be interested in management's take on capital allocation, and how it views M&A (to expand from its current ion implant-centric business).",Patrick J. Ho,"Patrick J.

ACLS US,ACLS,Dec 16 2021 09:08PM,"Axcelis Technologies, Inc.",Semiconductor Capital Equipment,Stronger Mature Node Outlook and Increasing Implant Intensity Drive Higher 2022 Estimates; Target Price to $73 ,"Following Axcelis’ recent Analyst Day and our increase in 2022 wafer fab equipment (WFE)spending trends, in turn, we are raising our FY22 (Dec) estimates and our target price to $73 (from $67) that reflect these increased forecasts. We recently raised our 2022E WFE outlook and highlighted the key growth drivers in the foundry/logic market (see our note, Semi Cap Update: Foundry/Logic is the Largest Driver for 2022 WFE (with Mix of Advanced and Trailing- Edge) but Supply Situation May Not Resolve Itself Until 2023, Dec. 15), and in particular on the mature node front. We believe this segment is seeing not only wafer starts (and capacity) growth, but also increasing implant intensity trends that benefit Axcelis. We believe this is a key catalyst for its growth outlook not only in 2022, but going forward as well. We maintain our Buy rating and believe any pullback represents an attractive buying opportunity. ","From a market perspective, we noted going into the analyst day that the overall ion implant market was likely larger than historical trends (see our note, Axcelis: Analyst Day Preview: Capitalizing on a Larger Market Opportunity and Driving Higher Earnings on New Target Model, Dec. 5). We estimated the overall ion implant market was likely closer to $2B, which was reaffirmed by management. More importantly, within this market growth, mature node saw some of the largest appreciation, as new materials (and engineering needs) and productivity became more critical to chipmakers. Moreover, this market expansion drove growth in the high energy market, which Axcelis is the market share leader. We now estimate that high energy is the second largest sub-segment within ion implant, trailing only high current (and now surpassing medium current). We recently touted that 2022 WFE growth will be driven most by the foundry/ logic segment, and within that a broad mix between leading edge (we estimate 55-60% of total foundry/logic) and trailing-edge (40-45%). This breakdown reflects the expanding presence of the trailing-edge, and plays into Axcelis’ “sweet spot.” We believe strong growth prospects for the mature node market and increasing implant intensity trends (for this segment) are the key catalysts to our increased estimates. We should note that we are also expecting memory revenues to grow for Axcelis in 2022, even as the percentage of revenues remains at the 20-25% level. We believe both mature node and memory have grown (and in some cases meaningfully), and the percentages are off of significantly higher bases than historical marks. From an Axcelis perspective, we believe the company is positioned to capitalize on these trends by expanding and focusing its product offerings. We believe that a larger ion implant market and increasing implant intensity at the mature nodes have been the catalysts for Axcelis in its product development and its expanded installed base/services offerings. The company is now well positioned to address emerging market trends in the power semiconductor and image sensor markets, with various systems and extension offerings. For example, for SiC applications, the company has several solutions/offerings for customers, ranging from the H200 SiC (high current) to the XE SiC to the EXE SiC. On the image sensor front, the company also has new offerings primarily on the high energy end, including the EXE, the VXE, and XEmax. Moreover, we believe that as the installed base continues to increase, this will drive growth in its CS&l business, as the company has expanded to more “value-added” offerings. These are the key company-specific drivers for our strong outlook (and increased estimates for 2022).",Patrick J. Ho,"Patrick J.

ACMR US,ACMR,Dec 01 2021 09:58PM,"ACM Research, Inc.",Semiconductor Capital Equipment,Next Phase of Growth Begins with Major U.S. Chipmaker Win as Technology Becomes Key Differentiator ,"On Wednesday after the market close, ACM Research announced “the receipt of two ordersfor ACM’s Ultra C SAPS V 12-chamber cleaning tools from a major U.S.-based global semiconductor manufacturer.” One of these tools is an evaluation system to “further confirm the tool’s cleaning performance and finalize specific features,” and the other is a production-based tool to be placed in the chipmaker’s advanced node manufacturing line. We believe this is a key inflection for the company as it has broken through not only with a major U.S. chipmaker but on a production-basis on its advanced node. We believe this supports ACM’s strategic vision of becoming an international equipment supplier, while also highlighting its strong technology differentiation (which we believe investors do not fully appreciate). With the recent completion of its Shanghai exchange IPO and the stock’s recent sell-off, valuations are attractive, and we maintain our Buy rating on the shares. ","We believe this win with a U.S. chipmaker is a major breakthrough for ACM. ACM has repeatedly stated its intention to become a global, international supplier of equipment. Its strength today is in the Chinese market, and while it has non-Chinese customers (like SK Hynix), we believe this win with a U.S. chipmaker could lead to additional multi-national semiconductor manufacturer wins in the future. We also believe this win is notable in that it is to be placed in production in the U.S. at an “advanced node,” which highlights that this win was achieved through technology differentiation. We believe this win is reflective of this customer’s traditional method of beginning new equipment suppliers with one (or two) applications and increasing an equipment presence over successive nodes. These evaluations can take several quarters to over a year, and it is notable as this likely reflects process tool-of-record (PTOR) for this chipmaker’s most advanced node. We also believe this win dispels a misconception investors have on ACM that as a Chinese-based equipment supplier, it does not have differentiated technology. We have noted previously that ACM is one of the very few Chinese-based equipment companies that has differentiated technology, and can be competitive at advanced nodes (whereas we would concur most Chinese equipment suppliers are better suited for the trailing-edge). We also believe this technology differentiation is reflected in its gross margin profile (40-45%), which is higher than many other Chinese-based equipment suppliers. We also believe the company’s overall growth story remains firmly intact. While forecasts for China spending is projected to decline in 2022, we remain confident in our current estimates for growth next year. We believe the company is expected to see expansion in new markets, like furnace and electroplating (particularly with some second-tier foundries in China), while a segment we expect to see strong growth over the next several years is on the advanced packaging end. The company has made several inroads in this market, and China is becoming a more important region in this emerging marketplace. We believe this multi-market approach is one that can drive above-average growth for ACM over the next several years. In our view, this major win with a U.S. chipmaker supplements these other market opportunities that AMC has established over the past two years.",Patrick J. Ho,"Patrick J.

ADC US,ADC,Dec 15 2021 05:37PM,Agree Realty Corporation,Triple-Net REITs,Recent Equity Raise Sets Up Balance Sheet For 2022 ,"Prices Equity Offering. Last week, Agree Realty Corporation priced 5.75 million shares,assuming the shoe is exercised, for net proceeds of $376 million. The offering priced at $68.15 per share. The offering allows for a head start on 2022 capital raising. ","Provides Additional Funding For Late 2021/2022 Acquisitions. The net proceeds of ~ $376 million, in addition to the ~$226.5 million of forward shares available to be settled (~3.4 million shares) though forward sales agreements, provide the company with significant dry powder to execute on their investment pipeline. We believe the announced offering further indicates the company's impressive acquisitions pipeline. Updates QTD Acquisition Activity, Strong Pipeline. The offering prospectus provided an update on 4Q21 acquisition activity to date. ADC has had acquired 33 properties for an aggregate purchase price of ~$161.9 million. Additionally, the company has purchase and sale agreements (PSA) and/or LOIls for the purchase or development of 100 properties with total investment value of ~$445.0 million. Lastly, the prospectus noted that the company anticipates entering into a PSA to acquire a 55-property portfolio with investment value of ~ $181.0 million. These properties are leased to tenants in the off-price retail, C-Store, dollar store, tire and automotive service, farm and rural supply, home improvement, and general merchandise space. Closed Acquisitions/PSAs Nearing Guidance Range. ADC's 2021 acquisition guidance is $1.3-$1.4 billion. Inclusive of 4Q21 acquisitions closed to date, the company has acquired ~$1.23 billion. It should finish the year towards the upper-end. Amends And Restates Credit Facility.

ADM US,ADM,Dec 21 2021 12:29PM,Archer-Daniels-Midland Company,Agriculture,Investor Day Breakdown: Higher and more stable base earnings supported by Nutrition portfolio; Buy; Target to $78 ,"During Archer-Daniels-Midland’s Investor Day, the company detailed its plans to push towardhigher and more stable baseline operating income across each business segment. The majority of this growth is expected to stem from long-term trends surrounding food security, health & wellness, and sustainability, which should also prove to increase portfolio diversification. ADM is targeting $1.2 billion in operating income and an EPS range of $6.00-7.00/sh by 2025. We believe the company made a strong case for its Biosolutions and Nutrition portfolios, which we believe could see additional upside in later years from key investments in areas such as synthetic biology. We maintain our Buy rating and raise our target price to $78 reflecting a 16x (roughly mid-cycle) P/E multiple on our blended 2022/23 EPS estimate of $4.86/sh. ","Investor Day Highlights (ex-Nutrition): A key theme for both Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions was a focus on stabilizing earnings volatility by leveraging the existing asset base toward markets with higher growth. In Ag Services and Oilseeds, this includes increasing destination marketing volumes to complement and improve overall trading earnings. ADM also plans to increase crushing capacity in order to take advantage of improved crushing margins driven by increased renewable green diesel (RGD) demand. In Carbohydrate Solutions, the company expects to leverage its dextrose assets to target less cyclical markets such as sustainable packaging, pharmaceutical, and fermentation-based markets. ADM is also targeting more bio-based products through its partnerships with LG Chem (producing corn-based lactic acids used in biodegradable plastics) and Gevo (allocating a majority of its ethanol capacity towards non-vehicle fuel markets like Sustainable Aviation Fuels). While energy and inflation- related market headwinds are expected to impact both segments, ADM believes its initiatives will more than offset these market headwinds, driving 2025 base operating earnings targets for Ag Services & Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions of $2.7-$3.1 bn and $800 mn-$1.1 bn, respectively. Nutrition Outlook: We continue to favor this business segment, and also expect that investments made in areas such as synthetic biology are likely to drive upside in later years as these products reach commercial scale. The company highlighted investments in Specialty Ingredients (mostly in alternative proteins) and Health & Wellness (probiotics and fermentation) as key drivers of future growth that tap into trends like flexitarian diets and gut biome health, respectively. Overall, ADM believes these investments should improve 2025 base operating earnings to $1.25-$1.50 bn, with the company emphasizing the high likelihood of reaching the upper end of this range. Current Market Highlights: US exports of corn and soybeans continue to track down y/ y, despite November Chinese imports of US soybeans increasing over 350% m/m following Hurricane Ida impacts. Soybean crush margins have fallen m/m, though they still remain up significantly y/y, likely driven by continued RGD demand growth. While Canada Canola crush margins have faded from highs, they remain elevated relative to 2015-2020 levels. Reports indicate that South America has been experiencing adequate rainfall, save for the southern regions of Brazil and the northern regions of Argentina. Despite improved prospects for crop production relative to last year, Brazil corn and soybean prices remain elevated vs. historical levels, supporting US corn basis, in particular.

AGCO US,AGCO,Dec 15 2021 08:19PM,AGCO Corporation,Machinery,"AGCO NDR Recap: Supply Chain Issues Linger, but Outlook Strong into 2022 ",We recently had the pleasure of hosting AGCO management for a series of meetings earlier thisweek and came away encouraged by the prospects for the company and the shares. Demand remains healthy with backlogs extending 6-9 months into 2022 in both NA and EU. With supply chain disruptions likely to linger into 1H22 we think demand is on pace to outstrip supply again in 2022. Layering in low dealer inventories across most markets and a more stable price/cost going forward we think the ongoing replacement cycle could potentially see momentum into 2023 driving margin improvements as well. We remain positive on the shares given this backdrop. ,"Near-term outlook remains quite strong and points to healthy 2022. On the most recent 3Q21 call, AGCO noted a strong order book that extended out 6-9 mos into 2022 for North American and European markets. Brazil extends out 3 months, but this was purposely truncated to help manage price/cost. True demand extends beyond 3 months. Taking all of this together this is nearly twice the visibility we would normally see at this point in the year. Admittedly, some of this elevated backlog is supply chain related, but we continue to view this is largely a function of demand outstripping the ability to supply. With healthy farmer net income, used equipment prices tracking 20% higher in the last 12-18 months, and years of below trend industry unit sales, we think this helps the replacement cycle extend into 2023. Farmer sentiment remains elevated, despite recent drop. Farmer sentiment is off its highs from earlier this year according to Purdue Ag Barometer (US indicator) and CEMA Index (Europe indicator) but still remains healthy. We attribute the decline to supply chain headwinds, overall inflation, and the recent increase in nitrogen prices among other factors. However, higher crop prices, strong OEM backlogs, and low dealer inventory levels remain supportive of the ongoing replacement cycle, in our opinion. After industry unit sales peaked in the 2013-14 time period, the industry experienced 5-6 years of very weak end market demand. Strong used equipment prices is reflective of this lack of supply and healthy commodity prices. Since new sales are accompanied by trade-ins we think conditions exist for the replacement cycle to drive unit volumes. Supply chain issues lingering, supports another year of healthy pricing. Supply chain issues have been a key headwind for all OEMs in 2021. While this likely continues into 1H22, the good news is that many of these headwinds appear to have stabilized (not worsening). Chip shortages remain top of mind for investors, but disruptions have extended from hydraulic systems to tires to anything in between. With materials accounting for 70% of COGS, the fact that margins will finish 2021 ~150bps higher y/y speaks to the ability to manage these supply chain issues. We also think it speaks to the structural changes underway at AGCO to take out costs and improve the overall margin profile of the enterprise. Recent new product introductions and the push to make Fendt a more global brand are tracking well. With AGCO’s technology suite and expanded distribution we continue to see a framework for AGCO’s growth to outpace the industry. The company has previously targeted +10% EBIT margins compared to our 8.1% and 9.3% 2021 and 2022 estimates. We continue to have confidence in AGCO’s ability to achieve these targets this cycle.",Stanley S. Elliott,"Stanley S.

ALLO US,ALLO,Dec 14 2021 12:06AM,"Allogene Therapeutics, Inc.",Biotechnology,"ASH Update - Consolidation Data Hard To Interpret, We Think ALLO-501A Durability Still TBD ","We remain Hold rated following updates for ALLO-501A and ALLO-715; although certaincohorts of ALLO-501A appear competitive with autologous approaches, we have a hard time gaining conviction on the durability profile at this point as other cohorts are harder to interpret. Data from the consolidation regimen-1 cohort look good, in our view, but the dataset is small. More confounding though, the second consolidation cohort (regimen-2) looks substantially worse, though it uses the same CAR-T/ALLO-647 dose, but slightly higher chemo. We wouldn't expect higher chemo (cyclophosphamide specifically) to have such a big impact as this wasn't the case for DTIL's high-dose chemo preconditioning regimen (quite the opposite actually), and so we have a hard time gaining high conviction that ALLO-501A is truly driving Yescarta-like efficacy. No details were provided on the clinical hold; in the interim, we'd expect debate about the durability of allogeneic CAR-T approaches to persist. ","ALLO will advance the ALLO-501A consolidation 1 regimen into a pivotal phase 2 study; we think the results are comparable to autologous CAR T, but we stop short of labeling them as robust. In a vacuum, results for consolidation regimen 1 (n=9) are almost Yescarta- like. The 6-month CR rate is 22% (2/9), but there's one patient in a CR that's ongoing and almost at the 6-month mark; including this patient would boost the 6-month CR rate to 33% (3/9), which is right at the level we would expect from autologous CAR T. Notably, 3 PRs converted to a CR, and the cell kinetics data were consistent with the second dose as conferring a second expansion phase, though the timing of expansion didn't exactly correlate with the second dose in one case. Based on these results, management is moving this regimen forward into phase 2. However, consolidation regimen 2 (higher cyclophosphamide dosing) shakes our enthusiasm for this strategy. At this point, only 1/10 patients have achieved a CR. Follow-up times are generally short; the CR is ongoing out to just 4+ months. Management commented on the call that they're hopeful some of the ongoing partial responses, of which there are 4, will convert into complete responses eventually. We think that's certainly possible as delayed responses aren't uncommon with CAR T, but at this point, regimen 2 looks starkly different from regimen 1 when it comes to remission rates. We don't know why higher cyclophosphamide would have such a profound impact on the remission rate of CAR T, and can't help but speculate that the different results are a product of small sample sizes. Analyzing regimens 1 and 2 together, we calculate a 6-month CR rate of ~16% (3/19). To be candid, we have no idea what the right way to analyze the data is, which is why we lack confidence in focusing solely on regimen 1 as the best point estimate of ALLO-501's efficacy. Net-net, while certain cohorts provide evidence that ALLO-501A might be able to replicate auto CAR T efficacy, we find it hard to gain a high level of conviction in the ALLO-501A consolidation regimen 1 at this point in time given the small amount of data and what we interpret to be confounding results from regimen 2. The safety profile for consolidation regimen 1 is acceptable, and better than regimen 2, and we speculate a factor for moving it forward into pivotal studies. No grade 3+ safety events, nor were there any CRS or GvHD of any grade, observed in the consolidation 1 cohort. In contrast, the rates of grade 3+ infection and neutropenia were 10% and 60%, respectively, in the consolidation 2 cohort. Interestingly, the chromosome 14 translocation event occurred in a patient enrolled in consolidation cohort 2. Could the higher cyclophosphamide have somehow contributed to this? Maybe, but this is also the regimen used ahead of Yescarta, and so our bias is probably not.Within...takeaways on initial ALLO-715 in MM;",Benjamin J. Burnett,"Benjamin J.

ANGN US,ANGN,Dec 10 2021 06:01AM,Angion Biomedica Corp.,Biopharmaceuticals,ANG-3777 in CSA-AKI PoS Mixed and Exploring Path Forward; Lower TP to $5 ,"Exploration continues in CSA-AKI, where the Ph.2 PoC for ANG-3777 failed to meet the primarycreatinine endpoint and most secondaries, though the most relevant endpoint of MAKE90 (likely the Ph.3 primary) demonstrated positive trends. Specifically, while there was no signal on the shorter-term MAKE30, ANG-3777 showed 31.5% fewer MAKE90 events relative to placebo, resulting in an odds ratio of 0.60—far better than internal expectations. With its partner Vifor, ANGN will be exploring patient-specific data to determine whether there is consistency between short-term measurements translating into longer-term MAKE90 benefits—these were not immediately obvious. In the event that measurements line up, ANGN/Vifor intend to pursue a Ph.3 program, though next steps remain quite uncertain, as ANGN is “not desperate” to rescue 3777. We reduce the ANG-3777 probability-of-success in CSA-AKI to 20%, lowering our TP to $5, and look to ANG-3070 fibrosis program (in IgAN/FSGS) to become the value-driver (not included ). ","ANG-3777 shows spotty signals of effect: The CSA-AKI Ph.2 GUARD study evaluated 259 patients who are at risk for developing AKI after undergoing cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass. The trial did not achieve its primary endpoint of mean AUC of the percent baseline increase in serum creatinine (SrCr) through Day 6 after surgery, with 8.5% ANG-3777, and 7.3% pbo (p=0.77). The incidence of AKI through Day 6 was also shown not have a clinical benefit, though ANGN noted that their inclusion of higher risk factors did not correlate with a higher number of AKIs. In MAKE90 (major adverse kidney events at day 90), which was not powered for in this Ph.2 but known to be the likely endpoint in a Ph.3 trial, ANG-3777 saw much better results than expected. MAKE90 is a composite endpoint of death, initiation of renal replacement therapy, or a >25% decline in eGFR present at 90 days after surgery. The ANG-3777 arm had 14.7% with MAKE90 events, compared to 21.5% pbo (0.60 odds ratio; p=0.155). Other trials in CSA-AKI have demonstrated high relative risk reductions of AKI (26% RRR in Quark’s trial of QPI-1002 with 37% AKI in treatment arm and 50% pbo). For ANG-3777, there were 31.6% fewer events, though the company was expecting 20-25% and would have hit stat-sig at 40%. Specifically, within MAKE90, fewer patients saw decline in eGFR >25% (measured by CKD-EPI formula) at day 90 in the treatment group vs. pbo (5.6% vs 16.2%; p=0.012). While MAKE90 looked impressive, the MAKE30 (major adverse kidney events at day 30) did not show benefit—inconsistent with MAKE90 and requiring additional details to tease out inconsistency. Searching through the rubble, but not desperate to find a path forward: The readout provided a mixed bag of data for ANGN to digest in the coming weeks, as ANGN and Vifor will make a decision about whether to move into a Ph.3 study early 1Q22 (Jan/Feb). Before the readout, ANGN has stated that they are looking for consistency of effect, though statistical significance in the MAKE90 was not expected. Instead, the GUARD study provided a lack of consistency across endpoints at the population level—despite MAKE90 results being much better than expected. To move forward, ANGN is looking to find some consistency in the data from a longitudinal perspective at the patient level. If they can find mechanistic rationale for the MAKE90 and MAKE30 endpoint discrepancies and some consistency in certain patient populations/biomarker, they may choose to move the program forward. Offering an inconclusive rationale, ANGN mentioned that they would expect ANG-3777 to help preserve kidney reserves and the ability to withstand another kidney, insult which may explain...

AQUA US,AQUA,Dec 10 2021 11:32AM,Evoqua Water Technologies Corp.,Water Technologies,AQUA: Strong Impact Profile With Improving ESG Goals ,"We maintain our Buy rating on AQUA shares with a $53 target price. We were fortunate tohost Snehal Desai, Chief Growth and Sustainability Officer, Julia Saintz, Sustainability Manager, Laura Allston, Sustainability Specialist, and IR Daniel Brailer for virtual investor meetings this past week to get a better understanding of the company's impact profile. Separately we hosted CFO Ben Stas for investor meetings. We continue to believe Evoqua's business model enabling water recycle/reuse has the highest impact profile in our coverage with this week's meetings also highlighting the progress the company is making in improving its internal ESG profile. ","Evoqua's Footprint/ESG: Evoqua plans to set science-based targets by 2023 and aims to achieve net-zero GHG by 2050. Management is focused on a science-based approach, has added resources, and utilized consultants to drive hard data on the company's emissions. Management noted there are opportunities within the company's operations to improve its carbon footprint and shifting the company's service fleet to hybrids and EVs over time. By 2035, Evoqua aims to have its facilities reuse more water than is withdrawn. Management noted there has been a lot of work done including making water efficiency plans and naturally making investments with the company's own technologies. ESG metrics are included in the company's F2022 annual incentive program including a 5% weighting for safety and 5% weighting related to water recycle/reuse. Management estimates ~1,000 employees in the organization (25% of the workforce) are on the annual incentive plan which should help to drive the company's water reuse target. Evoqua's Handprint/Impact: Management believes that the market trend towards sustainability is a long-term growth driver. Evoqua is committed to creating solutions that will profitably help its customers reach their ESG commitments. Management noted that the sustainability conversation is moving up the customers’ organizational chain to become a more strategic priority. Evoqua's water recycle/reuse solutions drive energy savings and reduce customers' carbon footprint. Conserving and reducing the amount of water that is drawn out of the public utility lowers the amount of energy used to transport water, which can be significant in aggregate. Evoqua's solutions can also directly reduce carbon emissions in verticals like food processing facilities and cooling towers used at data centers. Evoqua has an anaerobic digestion technology that captures biogas from organic waste, contains emissions, and turns this waste into energy. Evoqua products filter, disinfect, and prevent deposits from forming on cooling tower elements that are used in data centers leading to reduced energy usage. Evoqua has the right combination of technologies for treating PFAS and emerging contaminants in drinking water.",Nathan Jones,"Nathan Jones, CFA;Adam M.

AQUA US,AQUA,Dec 20 2021 02:18PM,Evoqua Water Technologies Corp.,Water Technologies,AQUA: Acquires Renal Business from STERIS; Demonstrative of the M&A Strategy We Expect from Evoqua ,"We reiterate our Buy rating on AQUA shares with a $57 target price. Evoqua announced thismorning that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the renal business from STERIS (STE, not covered) for $196.3 million representing a purchase price of 7.3x EBITDA, in line with historical acquisition multiples. We view this transaction positively from a financial perspective, solid EBITDA margins, low multiple relative to AQUA multiple, and from a strategic perspective as it adds incremental products/technology and more service capabilities which we view as Evoqua's biggest competitive differentiator. ","Purchase price of $196.3 million, inclusive of $12.3 million earn-out. Revenue of $180 million. EBITDA of $27 million. Pre-synergy EBITDA margins of 15%. Purchase multiple of 7.3x. Proforma net leverage, pre-synergies, of 2.9x. Stifel Thoughts Evoqua has historically made acquisitions in the 5-9x EBITDA range pre-synergies and this deal fits right in the middle of that range while being somewhat larger than previous acquisitions. We view this acquisition as fitting in with Evoqua's stated strategy to fill product gaps (acquires products in dialysis treatment) and to expand its service footprint (adds 27 service and regeneration sites). Management noted that this acquisition fills its remaining product gap within hospitals and now enables it as a one-stop-shop for water purification within hospitals. We view this acquisition favorably and as highly accretive to shareholders with the acquisition multiple of 7.3x while the stock trades at ~22x our 2022E EBITDA. Asarule of thumb, we use 5% of revenue in synergies. This implies post synergy margins of ~20%, slightly dilutive to the low 20% ISS EBITDA margins. Post synergy acquisition multiple of 5.5x. We believe this acquisition is illustrative of Evoqua's strategy to fill in product gaps and expand on its service network to increase differentiation and enable outsourced water growth. We expect to see more acquisitions that look just like this one in the coming years. Proforma net leverage still just below 3.0x with our model forecasting F2022 proforma net leverage down to 2.4x (company target 2.5x-3.0x) leaves moderate flexibility for further tuck- in acquisitions. We will update our model once the transaction has closed.",Nathan Jones,"Nathan Jones, CFA;Adam M.

ARVN US,ARVN,Dec 10 2021 10:59AM,"Arvinas, Inc.",Biotechnology,"ARV-471 And SERD SABCS Data: 2L+ HR+ mBC Approvals Likely Across Drugs, But 1L Success Likelihood Unchanged ","While the phase 1 data update for ARV-471 (estrogen receptor [ER] degrader) continuedto look strong at SABCS 2021, some luster has come off estrogen degraders after the elacestrant 2L+ HR+ mBC trial had a small 1-month median PFS benefit that was driven by ESR1 mutation (ESR1m) patients. We believe ARV-471 can likely succeed in a similar trial, but this market is estimated to be ~$1bn and will be hyper-competitive. Investors want evidence to increase the probability that ARV-471 will be successful in the more valuable 1L setting, and the data across SABCS clinical trials did not add incremental support to this thesis. As such, exiting the conference we are not increasing our 1L PoS for ARV-471, and our estimates and target price are unchanged. We look to ARV-471 phase 2 data in 2022 to better understand the read-through for earlier line PoS. ","SABCS 2021 ARV-471 data update very similar to prior data and abstract. The clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 40% (19/47) in the post-CDK4/6 setting appears to be the highest across the competitive SERD class. The overall response rate (ORR) was low at 8% (3/38), but we continue to believe CBR is the better metric to determine the potential ARV-471 PFS in the pivotal 2L+ HR+ mBC trial, which only needs to beat a 2-month PFS in the control arm. In this phase 1, a 40% CBR suggests that 40% of patients had disease stability for 6 months, which serves as a proxy for a 40% landmark 6-month PFS. Safety continued to look promising with only 4 (7%) grade 3 events. The biggest competitive question might be the asymptomatic QTc prolongation given the bradycardia observed for some SERD options. ARV-471 had a better CBR in the ESR1m population. Although not presented, management stated the CBR was approximately 50% in ESR1m and 29% in ESR1 wild-type patients. Management believed that across SERDs and for ARV-471 that an ESR1 mutation was a signature for therapy responsiveness to new SERDs and ARV-471. Data at SABCS suggested ESR1m occurs in up to 40% of 2L+ HR+ mBC patients. Arguably more important than the ARV-471 data, SABCS 2021 also had the first oral SERD pivotal trial in 2L+ HR+ mBC. The SERD elacestrant beat standard of care endocrine therapy (predominantly fulvestrant) in both the ESR1m (3.8m vs. 1.9m) and all-comer (2.8m vs. 1.9m) populations. Although the trial was statistically successful, these data will be disappointing to many investors as the benefit is numerically low and appears to be driven only by the ESR1m population. Positive read-throughs for ARV-471: ARV-471 is likely to be successful in a similar 2L+ trial as long as it does not recruit significantly fewer ESR1m patients. The separation of PFS curves after the initial period of early drop-off (presumed to be patients with primary endocrine resistance) suggests newer SERDs could be more effective than fulvestrant in patients that are sensitive to endocrine therapies, which will be needed for a successful 1L trial. The initial competitive bar set by elacestrant is low, and the numerically superior phase 1 data for ARVN-471 could translate into a larger cross-trial median PFS benefit in a similar trial and subsequent market share gains. Negative read-throughs for ARV-471: The short PFS will create a debate about clinical meaningfulness of SERDs amongst physicians, and means the 2L+ market sales potential will be small absent combinations that extend therapy duration. The magnitude of benefit is not entirely supportive that new SERDs or ARV-471 will be successful in the more valuable 1L and adjuvant settings. The benefit of new SERDs and ARV-471 is most pronounced in ESR1m patients, but this mutation is rare in 1L and adjuvant settings. Next catalysts for ARV-471 in 2022. The phase 2 VERITAC trial testing doses of 200 and 500mg is fully enrolled (n=~30) with 2022 interim data. ARVN also expects to have initial combination data with lbrance, targeted therapies, and newer CDK2/4/6 inhibitors. ARVN and Pfizer will also initiate multiple phase 3 trials next year.

ATRA US,ATRA,Dec 09 2021 06:16PM,"Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc.",Biotechnology,"ATA2271 Data From ESMO-IO Are Interesting, But Very Early; No Change To Our Model ","Our views remain unchanged following the release of preliminary data on ATA2271(mesothelin-targeting autologous CAR T) at ESMO-IO; no clinical efficacy was provided and the update largely focused on biomarker results. Our CAR T estimates remain unchanged. This is the first look at ATA2271, which includes the 1XX costimulatory domain (as does FATE's FT819) and a dominant negative PD-1 receptor. But in our view, it's hard to draw solid conclusions here, given that the update only includes preliminary biomarker data from 4 low-dose patients, and limited safety. Cell expansion in the peripheral blood is well below that of Yescarta, but we speculate that this is an underestimate of the true expansion at the tumor site. Longer term, we're looking forward to seeing partial HLA matched CAR T data, especially ATA3219 (CD19-CAR T) as we think this will exhibit superior persistence relative to unmatched cell therapy; ATA3219 IND filing in 1Q22. ","Preliminary clinical biomarker results for ATA2271 trend favorably, but it's very early to form a view on this asset especially in the absence of any clinical response information. The clinical update was from a sample of 4 patients and consisted of biomarker data including peak expansion, cell persistence and cytokine expression in serum. Peak expansion and cell persistence were presented for the 2 lowest dose cohorts of 1mm (n=3) and 3mm (n=1) cells. Overall, ATA2271 cells persisted over 4 weeks in peripheral blood and out to more than 10 weeks for the patient dosed with 3mm cells. The highest peak expansion was of 5,000-10,000 copies/mL and occurred around weeks 2 and 3, suggesting that the 1XX costimulatory domain on the CAR construct results in a slightly delayed peak expansion vs. Yescarta (peak around ~7 days on average) and Kymriah (peak around ~10 days on average). The level of peak expansion reported for ATA2271 also appears to be lower than Yescarta by 3 to 6-fold, but we think that the expansion data presented here, which captures cells in the peripheral blood, is likely an underestimate of the amount of expansion that occurs in the site of the solid tumor. The cytokine data are hard to interpret, as patients were lymphodepleted (albeit with a milder regimen that what's used ahead of Yescarta/Kymriah), though there does seem to be a trend towards higher cytokine levels in all three patients treated at dose level 1 at week 3 relative to baseline (the magnitude of increase isn't provided). Regarding safety, ATA2271 was described as well-tolerated at the lowest dose levels with no drug-related adverse events greater than grade 2 and no AEs greater than grade 3, which support dosing at higher levels (DL3 6mm cells, DL4 10mm cells and DL5 30mm cells). Initial drug product characterization seem to support that ATA2271 is expressing the PD-1 dominant negative receptor (DNR). The expression of the PD-1 intra domain was substantially decreased to near zero in the infused product relative to T cells in the apheresis material, whereas the PD-1 expression on the cell surface was considerably increased. We interpret this pattern as being consistent with the successful expression of ATRA's PD-1 DNR construct, which is designed to overcome checkpoint inhibition and T cell exhaustion.",Benjamin J.

Heading into ASH, we already knew that the ORR was above the pre-specified hurdle of 37%, but we're surprised to see the CR rate pull in as much as it did from the phase-2 (36% versus 58%, respectively, in HCT-PTLD). We can't help but wonder if this is driving the FDA to seek what at the time seemed like an unprecedented amount of product lot characterization data (74 lots versus the company's initial expectation of 15 lots). But still, the OS data look very similar to phase-2, and the unmet need in 2L PTLD is high, so we think approval is likely. We're lowering our PTLD POS to 60% (previously 75%) IA-LPD POS to 20% (from 25%); TP to $24/ share. ","Positive takeaways: the update for the phase 3 ALLELE study demonstrated good ORR and OS data. As of the May 2021 cutoff, there were 24 EBV+ solid organ transplant (SOT) PTLD patients and 14 EBV+ hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) PTLD patients. Breaking it down by subtype of PTLD, the ORR was 50% for both the SOT patients (12/24) and the HCT patients (7/14). Encouragingly, this is above the 37% hurdle that was pre-specified with the FDA. Additionally, patients who responded to tab-cel had a longer 1-year OS relative to non- responders, 89.2% vs 32.4%, respectively, and overall the OS data look very consistent with the phase 2 results generated by MSKCC. And finally, the remission rate in the SOT cohort looks consistent with the same cohort in phase 2. Negative takeaways: the remission rate in HCT-PTLD looks worse than what was seen in the phase 2. The phase 3 CR rate for the HCT patients was ~36% (5/14). For reference, the phase 2 study run by MSK reported a CR rate of 58% (19/33). Prior to the phase 3 disclosure, our view on tab-cel was more heavily biased by the HCT phase 2 data rather than the SOT phase 2 given that the sample size of the latter is much smaller (we're not surprised by the imbalance; we view MSKCC as a preeminent HCT institution and assume enrollment was easier in that arm relative to the SOT arm). Since the phase 3 data were consistent in just about every other way, we think it's entirely possible that the sample size of the HCT cohort has confounded the results. But regardless, as these are the data that ATRA is using to file with, we assume there's now more risk in approval (i.e. we think it's incrementally more possible that the FDA will ask for additional patient data given the variability in HCT remission rates). Meanwhile, we think the safety profile is manageable. There were no grade 3+ treatment- emergent serious adverse events (TESAE) related to treatment reported in the HCT cohort, and only 2 (8.3%) reported in the SOT cohort. Importantly, there were no treatment-related fatal TESAEs reported in either cohort. There were also no reports of GVHD, which we think bodes well for the partially HLA-matched, cell bank approach. Net-net, we're still bullish that tab-cel will be approved, especially given the OS data in such a high unmet need population. However, we now recognize more approval risk by lowering our PTLD POS to 60% (from 75%). Given the variability seen here, we're also lowering our POS slightly for tab-cel in IA-LPD to 20% (from 25%). These adjustments drop our TP by $3 to $24/share.",Benjamin J. Burnett,"Benjamin J. Burnett, PhD;Carolina Ibanez Ventoso, PhD;Neil Carnahan, CFA;Kailie M.

We view this transaction as a clear positive for AVNS for 3 key reasons: (1) the announcement provides credibility to recent M&A- related public commentary, and suggests another transaction could be disclosed in the very near-term; (2) OrthogenRx seems like a highly-complementary strategic fit to Avanos’ Pain Management business, given the already-approved GenVisc 850 and TriVisc hyaluronic acid therapy products are expected to add ~$65M to total AVNS 2022E sales; and (3) in-line with the company’s overall M&A strategy, the transaction will be immediately-accretive to margins.

AVNT US,AVNT,Dec 16 2021 04:38PM,Avient Corp.,Chemicals,Introducing 2023 estimates post-Investor Day; Raising target on strong confidence in growth targets; Maintain Buy ,"We are introducing 2023 estimates and providing a review of Avient's recent Investor Day,highlighting particular areas of interest. Overall we were positive on the content and tone of the day, which provided a closer look at the key drivers of Avient's end market-oriented growth targets. The Clariant integration has been a strong earnings and cash flow driver, and is now progressing toward a contributor to top-line as portfolio synergies are entering the pipeline. The detail surrounding the branded products and services should help investors better appreciate Avient's continued shift toward a materials solutions business. We are increasing our target price to $71 on a combination of solid earnings growth through our 2023 projections and a slightly higher valuation to reflect greater confidence in management's targets post-investor day; we maintain our Buy rating. ","Most of the ground in the Avient investor day was already well-tread by recently enhanced disclosures around more end market-related data. However, we believe that the messaging and deeper look at specific product lines helped to bolster the fact that Avient is continuing to make progress toward its strategy of driving growth through materials solutions. Given the significant increase in CA&l share of overall revenues as a result of the Clariant acquisition, this should prove helpful in getting investors to look deeper into the value creation opportunity across the portfolio as a whole. The investor day marked the first major reset since the significant Clariant colors acquisition, though much of the strategy was familiar given the company’s recent evolution toward more end-market focused disclosure and commercialization strategy. The acquisition of Clariant’s business has bolstered the company’s presence and Healthcare and Consumer markets; where cost synergies were already well-ahead of schedule, the pandemic was also able to help kick start commercial synergies given Avient’s successful navigation of the crisis from a business continuity and supply-reliability perspective helped win new business across its product lines that are now helping in the cross-selling efforts of existing materials into accounts brought over by Clariant. Coupled with ample cash generation for continued bolt-on M&A, we view the portfolio as well-positioned to meet growth targets over the medium term. Given the solid disclosure to support medium-term growth projections, M&A opportunities, and ample cash flow to facilitate share buybacks and manage leverage, we have a high degree of confidence in Avient meeting or exceeding its earnings projections over the next few years, and believe shares will be rewarded in kind. We are updating our model to introduce 2023 estimates, and smooth some earnings growth from 2022 to 2023 to account for continued headwinds in automotive (est. <15% of sales), but overall remain positive on both the near-term and medium- term outlook. We maintain our Buy rating and raise our target price to $71 reflecting additional earnings growth through 2023 and a modestly higher valuation (11.5x vs. 11.0 previously) given the greater confidence in management's outlook post-investor day.

BLDR US,BLDR,Dec 07 2021 09:32PM,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",Building Products,"Analyst Day Takeaways: FCF Deployment, Market Share Gains & Digital Drive 2025 Targets ","We attended BLDR’s analyst day and came away impressed by the 2025 targets as well asthe emerging digital platform opportunity. BLDR expects its “base” business (assuming lumber ~$400/mbf) revenue CAGR of ~10% through 2025, ~200 bps of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, and increasing adjusted EPS by 3x from $4.10 in 2021 to $12.40 in 2025. This embeds modest assumptions around market growth (LSD-MSD) and lumber prices (currently at ~$900/mbf with futures curve trending toward ~$800 over 2022), though assumptions do include M&A, ~$5B of share repurchases, market share gains, digital platform growth and higher value-added penetration. We were encouraged by BLDR’s recently acquired digital business, providing end-to-end software platform for home building and allowing for creation of a digital marketplace to drive further sales to BLDR while improving the customer experience. We are maintaining our Buy rating and increasing our PT to $90 which is 8x 2022 EBITDA estimate. ","Value-added products to drive share and margins. Value-added products currently account for ~43% of overall product mix and continues to see outsized growth. This is being driven by a challenging labor environment, which is pushing traditional on-site work into off-site assembly. Manufactured components has grown ~48% organically YTD through 3Q21 reflecting this growth driver. In addition to easing labor constraints, offsite results in less waste and improves construction speeds. Value-added products typically have higher margins than BLDR’s more commodity-exposed product lines. As such, additional contribution from value-added is a key driver of the ~50 bps of annual adjusted EBITDA margin expansion expected through 2025. BLDR is also targeting value-added growth at a ~10% CAGR through 2025. Outlines targets for “base” business through 2025. BLDR outlined financial targets for its “pase” business (assuming lumber ~$400/mbf) from 2021 through 2025. This includes revenue growth CAGR of ~10% through 2025 from $15.7B in 2021 to $23.1B in 2025, adjusted EBITDA CAGR of ~15% from $1.8B in 2021 to $3.0B in 2025 (~50 bps of margin expansion annually from 11.2% to 13.2%), and adjusted EPS CAGR of ~30% from $4.10 in 2021 to $12.40 in 2025. Revenue growth is expected to be ~100-300 bps above market growth with contributions from core growth, product expansion (such as digital and additional value-added) and M&A. Adjusted EPS includes ~$3.10 of benefits from an expected ~$5B of share repurchase activity. Through 2025, BLDR expects to have the ability to deploy ~$7-10B of capital through ~$5.8B of FCF generation and adding leverage to maintain the 1-2x net leverage target. Additional details on financial target assumptions on page 2. Digital platform increases TAM, drives growth with attractive margins. BLDR sees an opportunity to be the technology leader in an industry that has lagged others in the digital transformation. BLDR’s strategy involves increasing its product offering while providing digital solutions that solve pain points for builders over a home’s life cycle (from land development to maintenance). Recent acquisitions including Paradigm and Apollo bolster BLDR’s digital capabilities in systems engineering and job site management and are expected to drive $1B in revenue growth in the next 5 years (at higher than corporate margins). Together, these acquisitions increase design functionality while providing a faster, more complete/accurate materials list for its customers. Longer term, BLDR envisions a digital marketplace for building materials which it sizes at $150B TAM. BLDR expects the creation of a digital marketplace to provide it with access to this entire market, beyond products that are considered core (core being doors, windows, framing lumber etc., future products being roofing, insulation, decking, appliances). While a small piece of BLDR’s overall business currently, we see the digital opportunity as attractive for both growth and margins.",Stanley S. Elliott,"Stanley S.

BOOM US,BOOM,Dec 22 2021 08:08PM,DMC Global Inc.,Oilfield Services & Equipment,Arcadia Acquisition a Plus; Bumping Target Price to $48 from $46 ,"DMC Global announced that it is acquiring a 60% stake in Arcadia, a privately-held supplier ofarchitectural products. The acquisition adds a third business segment to BOOM, and while there are no clear operating synergies, the acquisition significantly increases BOOM's addressable market, should provide stability to its revenue and earnings stream, and appears accretive. We are increasing our target price to $48 from $46 based on our initial analysis of the transaction, and maintaining our Buy. ","Agreement to Acquire 60% of Arcadia: DMC Global has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a 60% interest in privately-held Arcadia Inc., a leading U.S supplier of architectural building products. Under the terms of the agreement, BOOM is acquiring 60% of Arcadia for approximately $285.5 million ($262.0 million in cash and $20.5 million in stock) subject to adjustments and closing conditions. The cash portion is being funded with cash and from BOOM's $150.0 million credit facility. BOOM plans to acquire the remaining 40% of Arcadia over a three-year period with a floor valuation of $187.1 million, bringing the total implied acquisition cost to around $469.6 million. BOOM is paying 8.6x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, which seems reasonable based on Arcadia's growth and its comps that are shown in Exhibit 3. BOOM's management believes the deal will be accretive within the first year of closing and plans to have Arcadia continue to operate as a stand-alone business. Arcadia Meets BOOM's Acquisition Criteria: BOOM has been patiently seeking an acquisition since it completed a $123.5 million capital raise in early May 2021. Arcadia appears to meet all the key criteria BOOM was seeking for in a deal, including a business that is well run, expands its total addressable market, increases the scale and diversity of its revenue base, has a sustainable competitive advantage, and is accretive. Addressable Market Rises Significantly: BOOM highlighted that its total addressable market expands to about $6.5 billion. Management estimates NobelClad currently has 20% of a $500 million addressable market, DynaEnergetics 20% of a $1.5 billion market, and Arcadia 5% of a $4.5 billion market. Current Estimates: We are maintaining our current 2021-23 EBITDA forecasts for DMC Global of $24.3 million, $47.4 million and $80.3 million, respectively. Assuming 100% ownership of Arcadia, we estimate the deal adds about $58.3 million and $64.3 million to our 2022-23 EBITDA, bringing the totals to $109.7 million and $148.6 million, respectively. It is worth noting that BOOM will likely own 60% of Arcadia over the next three years before acquiring the remainder. Bumping Price Target: We are raising our target price on DMC Global to $48 from $46 based on our initial assessment of Arcadia’s EBITDA contribution in 2022 and 2023 (i.e., 60% of our forecast for Arcadia) as well as the new share count and pro forma balance sheet. As more details surface on the integration and Arcadia’s growth path under the DMC Global leadership becomes clearer, we believe there is upside to our initial Arcadia estimates and the target EBITDA multiple.",Stephen Gengaro,Stephen Gengaro,48,46,Buy,-,USD,1,,2.3,,,,339.9,,426.2,,,STIFEL_BOOM_CoNote_2021-12-22.pdf,BOOM_CoNote_2021-12-22,,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=01b8980d-915c-45c0-8a37-b88176188720&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
CALT US,CALT,Dec 15 2021 08:00PM,Calliditas Therapeutics AB,Biopharmaceuticals,Renal Division at FDA Grants Tarpeyo First Approval on Accelerated Basis—Raising TP to $55 ,"We reiterate our Buy rating on CALT, raising TP to $55. For the first time on accelerated basis,FDA has approved renal drug—Tarpeyo (formerly Nefecon) for |gA-Nephropathy. This is also the first-approved treatment for the orphan condition, which is currently treated with off-label use of RAS inhibitors and systemic corticosteroids. Tarpeyo is the well-understood budesonide steroid that targets treatment to the Peyer’s patch in the gut—the known source galactose-deficient IgA (Gd-IgA) production—to prevent complex formation and its migration to the kidney. Given this first-mover advantage, its targeted mechanism early in disease pathway and physician relative comfort with steroids (particularly one that largely avoids systemic exposure), we expect Tarpeyo to become the drug-of-choice after patients max-out on RASi but before more systemic competitors. Both Stifel and CALT physician checks have demonstrated high willingness to use, and payers appear receptive (price tag $55-85k). But ease-of-access will drive launch success. ","Tarpeyo label language bodes well for access and coverage: Tarpeyo is indicated to reduce proteinuria in adult patients with IgAN at high risk of progression, defined generally as urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) = 1.5 g/g (moderate-severe proteinuria). Nefigard entry criteria instead required UPCR >1 g/day (~0.8 g/g), and an eGFR band of between 35-90mL/min/1.73m2. We highlight that the language provides physicians with greater flexibility to diagnose high-risk patients, with the “> 1.5 g/g” value reading as a guideline rather than a hard rule in a condition where rate of kidney function decline dictates more about the disease— this should ultimately serve to expand both patient access and payer coverage. The accelerated approval was supported by strong results from Part A of the ongoing NeflgArd Ph.3 trial, in which patients taking once daily Tarpeyo + RASi saw a 34% proteinuria reduction from baseline at 9 months compared to a 5% proteinuria reduction with a RASi alone, translating into a UPCR reduction of 31%. Although the label notes that approval was based on proteinuria reduction only and may be contingent upon future evidence of disease-modifying activity, Part B of the NeflgArd trial will serve as confirmatory validation by assessing off-treatment eGFR at 2 years. We are confident in the capability of Tarpeyo to slow kidney function decline based on impressive Part A results, in which it demonstrated statistically significant eGFR stabilization compared to placebo (-0.17 Tarpeyo vs. -4.04 mL/min/1.73m? placebo). Part B results are expected in early 2023. The most common AEs occurring in >10% Tarpeyo patients from NeflgArd Part A were hypertension (16%), peripheral edema (14%), muscle spasms (13%), and acne (11%). The label additionally includes warnings for patients with moderate-severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B and C, respectively), who may be at greater risk of hypercorticism and adrenal axis suppression, and patients currently taking immunosuppressive drugs. Successfully transitioning into a commercial-stage company with peak sales of $902mn: The approval of Tarpeyo initiates CALT's transition into a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company. Throughout this year, the company has been preparing for authorization and commercial launch in the US, with anticipated availability to patients by early 1Q22. Previous commercial work has been done to minimize barriers and identify trade and distribution channels for quick patient uptake, a critical element as 70% of physicians have stated extremely likely to prescribe Tarpeyo. With approval, the commercial team will hire an additional 40 reps to its sales force and launch a comprehensive patient support program called Tarpeyo Touchpoints. The program is specifically designed with resources, offer services, and assistance to help patients access treatment as early as possible. While the price of Tarpeyo...

CCCC US,CCCC,Dec 06 2021 08:19AM,"C4 Therapeutics, Inc.",Biotechnology,"On The Morrow In The Marrow: Bristol, C4T, And The Race To Replace The Disappearing $16bn IMiD Franchise ","We remain Hold rated following Bristol's R&D Day and ahead of CELMoD (IKZF1/3degraders) multiple myeloma (MM) data at ASH21. CCCC's CFT7455 lags Bristol's efforts by 2-3 years, which is a difficult competitive positioning assuming Bristol's CELMoD program is to help replace 35% total revenue erosion after IMiD generic entrants. We believe new IKZF1/3 degraders look effective for late-line approvals, but have insufficient evidence that they could replace IMiDs. We acknowledge the bull case that CFT7455 preclinical data suggest best-in-class potential (but clinical proof is >2023), and that Bristol's strategy for iberdomide (the weaker CELMoD) to replace Revlimid could be exploited by CCCC, but this is a difficult investment thesis to support today. In our opinion, that upside potential is >10x the current valuation, and waiting for incremental thesis validation should not result in missing the full magnitude of potential performance. We present a deep dive on IKZF1/3 degraders herein. ","CFT7455 is 2-3 years behind Bristol's IMiD generic replacement strategy. Bristol's $16bn IMiD franchise is 35% of total sales and will be eroded by generics beginning in 2022. To offset this erosion Bristol has unveiled a pivotal development strategy for next-generation CELMoDs in head-to-head trials against IMiDs that initiate from 2022-23. CCCC's development of CFT7455, which entered phase 1 in June 2021, will be amidst this potential paradigm shift and the entrance of powerful anti-BCMA therapies. Although CCCC has the superior preclinical IKZF1/3 degrader dataset, Bristol has the development might, funding, and expertise in this category, and itis also desperate to offset one of the largest patent cliffs in large pharma history. Positively for CCCC, Bristol's monopolistic approach aimed at sequencing myeloma patients first on the weaker CELMobD iberdomide and then to CC-92480 presents a competitive opportunity for CCCC, but this bull case thesis will require patient investors willing to wait until the late 2020s. Are these new degraders potent enough to replace IMiDs? To date the most supportive evidence has been from very late-line trials of patients refractory to both IMiDs, where ORRs for the new CELMoDs range from ~30-50%. However, Bristol appears uninterested in a late-line approval, and is positioning primarily for 1L/2L. This strategy is supported by phase 1 three-drug combination studies (with dexamethasone and a proteasome inhibitor or anti-CD38), which have been difficult to compare to existing IMiD regimens given the differences in patient population treatment history. In our opinion, the potential superiority of CELMoDs in these datasets can be seen if one squints, but it does not directly jump off the page. For CCCC, material upside to the current valuation resides in the ability for new IKZF1/3 degraders to move earlier in MM treatment, and CELMoDs have not yet clearly supported this potential. Focus at ASH21 on ‘'480/BORT/dex data in patients after 2-4 treatments including lenalidomide. The ORR in the abstract is high at 74%, but 50% (9/19) of the patients had prior pomalidomide exposure. The combination of POM/BORT/dex already produces a high 82% ORR in lenalidomide pretreated patients (OPTIMISMM trial), so patient stratification will be helpful to determine the potential differentiation between CC-92480 and pomalidomide. As CC-92480 is considered to be the most like CCCC's CFT7455, if CC-92480 looks undifferentiated it could be interpreted negatively for all new IKZF1/3 degraders by bears or as an opportunity for CCCC to differentiate with the best-in-class drug by bulls. First CFT7455 phase 1 dose-escalation data in 2022.

CCL US,CCL,Dec 15 2021 09:11PM,Carnival Corporation & PLC,Gaming & Leisure,We Believe Shares Are Set Up Incredibly Well Heading into '22; Biz Update Should Provide Clarity Around CF Neutral; PT to $32 ,"What should investors be expecting come Monday when CCL gives their next business update?We recently have fielded this question multiple times. Most important is that we don’t believe CCL will be issuing 2022 financial guidance. There is some thought throughout the investor community that 2022 guidance could be issued but we don’t believe it’s possible right now given the current uncertain operating environment. With variants continuing to pressure near- term bookings as well as certain itineraries, and given the fact that CCL and the rest of the industry haven’t even started Wave Season, trying to give any type of outlook into next year is nearly impossible right now. We believe Monday’s call will focus more around booking trends for 2H22/2023 which we expect remain healthy/strong based on our field checks. We believe CCL shares are positioned incredibly well heading into 2022 and would be using recent weakness to buy. ","While we are lowering our near-term estimates to account for higher startup/marketing costs as well as delays across certain itineraries/jurisdictions, we aren’t overly concerned as we believe investors fully understand the next four to six months will be incredibly tough to model given the ever-changing landscape of the cruise industry. We continue to believe investors should be focused on 2023/2024 and beyond as that is the first time period CCL and the rest of the cruise industry should look “normal” again. We are estimating that CCL’s 2023 EBITDA will be ~15% higher than 2019 levels due to an uptick in net capacity as well as a leaner cost structure and higher pricing power. In addition, we have introduced our 2024 EBITDA estimate which is 39% higher than 2019 due to higher capacity and lower net operating costs. Our 2024 EPS estimate of $3.13 is 29% below 2019’s level but when you take into account the ~64% share dilution and the seven-fold increase in interest costs, we actually believe our 2024 EPS estimate is very encouraging. Our revised $32 price target is now based on 11x our 2024 EPS estimate, discounted back. We believe our 11x target multiple is actually conservative relative to historical trading multiples but is warranted given the higher borrowing costs and associated dilution. As investors get comfortable that the dilution risk is removed and the company continues to pay down higher priced debt, we believe CCL’s trading multiple should gravitate back to more normal levels. Bottom line though is that the recent weakness has presented an incredible buying opportunity heading into 2022. While long-only investors won't get involved with cruise stocks until the important cash flow breakeven level is achieved, we believe a lot of long-only investors are starting to do their work on these names in anticipation of that catalyst. As the Omicron variant noise eventually dwindles, we believe booking levels will return to normal very quickly, similar to what was witnessed around Delta. As we move into 2022, we believe CCL is positioned incredibly well given: (1.) Investor expectations are muted, (2.) We believe booking and pricing patterns should continue to accelerate for forward sailings, (3.) There is a massive opportunity to refinance a significant amount of debt, (4.) We believe CCL will hit the important breakeven cash flow point sometime in early 2Q22 which should remove the dilution fear, and (5.) We believe there will be upward revisions to out-year estimates.

CCL US,CCL,Dec 20 2021 05:59PM,Carnival Corporation & PLC,Gaming & Leisure,Positive Share Reaction Should Indicate CCL/Cruise Stocks Have Bottomed: Near-Term Variant Fears Priced In; PT Remains $32 ,"We are really encouraged how CCL shares reacted today (CCL +3% vs. S&P -1%) in a lousyoverall tape. We believe this is a good indication that investor expectations for the cruise sector are fairly benign at this point, which we like, heading into 2022. Booking commentary for 2H22/2023 remains upbeat and while there will be noise around near-term bookings until the Omicron headlines diminish, we believe current trading levels present an opportunity to own CCL shares before the world goes more toward recovery mode. We aren't overly concerned about the slowdown in bookings around Omicron fears as that slowdown should be short-lived, very similar to Delta. We expect CCL to emerge from this crisis as a leaner, more efficient company, which, combined with our continued confidence in the resilience of global cruise industry demand, strengthens our conviction in owing shares. Our $32 price target shows ~70% upside. ","Our Take: While Omicron fears will probably overhand CCL shares for the near-future (even though we believe most of these fears are now already embedded in current share levels), we remain extremely encouraged by booking/pricing trends. More important is CCL recorded its first month of positive cash flow from operations in November since the pandemic began as a result of steadily increasing customer deposits and healthy F4Q21 booking trends. While we believe there will be some choppiness month-to-month as the company continues to execute on its return to service plan due to higher drydocks and elevated restart costs, monthly cash flow from operations and EBITDA should be consistently positive beginning in 2Q22. Based on our estimates, 2023 EBTIDA (+14% versus 2019) should easily exceed 2019 levels, and we would argue our current pricing estimates remain conservative. The recent trading weakness has presented a buying opportunity heading into 2022, in our opinion. While long-only investors won't get involved with cruise stocks until the important cash flow breakeven level is achieved, we believe a lot of long-only investors are starting to do their work on CCL in anticipation of that catalyst. As the Omicron variant noise eventually dwindles, we believe booking levels will return to normal very quickly, similar to what was witnessed around Delta. As we move into 2022, we believe CCL is positioned incredibly well given: (1.) Investor expectations are muted, (2.) We believe booking and pricing patterns should continue to accelerate for forward sailings, (3.) There is a massive opportunity to refinance a significant amount of debt, (4.) We believe CCL will hit the important breakeven cash flow point sometime in early 2Q22 which should remove the dilution fear, and (5.) We believe there will be upward revisions to out-year estimates. While longer-term investors are currently hesitant to jump back into cruise stocks right now given the uncertainty around post-COVID demand as well as liquidity concerns, we believe as cruising continues to resume operations in North America and investors get more comfortable with the direction the business is going, we expect investors will start to buy cruise names again in anticipation of the lower supply environment down the road. CCL’s fleet will emerge from the crisis considerably more efficient with a roughly 10% larger average berth size and reduced average age. In addition, we believe the cruise industry's COVID protocols are being grossly overlooked. We don’t see a scenario in which cruise operations will be impaired for a significant amount of time. While there could be certain jurisdictions (Australia) that take longer to come back online, at this point it should be clear that a cruise vacation could be one of the safer vacation alternatives possible. We maintain our Buy rating while our price target remains at $32, which still shows ~70% upside from current levels. Read on.",Steven M. Wieczynski,"Steven M. Wieczynski, CFA;Jeffrey A.

CDRE US,CDRE,Dec 02 2021 09:42PM,"Cadre Holdings, Inc.",Defense & Government Services,Cadre Posts Slightly Better 3Q Results in First Quarterly Earnings Report; Maintain Hold ,"Cadre published 3Q adjusted EBITDA of $15.4m, slightly ahead of our estimate on $98.7min revenue (also slightly better). Cadre's management team, in our view, was very polished on the earnings call and conveyed conservatism toward M&A and confidence in a return to organic growth down the line, all of which we view positively. Our thesis, however, that Cadre will continue to face modest near-term organic growth headwinds and, as a result, should trade at a multiple slightly below the Government Services peer group remains intact. As Cadre did not provide updated guidance, we continue to model sequential quarterly revenue improvement as additional orders are fulfilled. We maintain our Hold rating and $20 target price. ","Law Enforcement Spend: We came away from the earnings call with a mostly unchanged view toward additional law enforcement spending amid worsening crime statistics. It will likely be a process of balancing recruiting new officers, paying higher wages (just as inflation permeates) and spending on safety. Since budgets are finite, it may take some time to balance those priorities. For now, we continue to model organic growth down slightly in 2022, which is based on management's revenue guidance (guidance is for revenue to increase but includes the acquisition of a European Holster company). M&A: Cadre had previously announced that it was in the late stages of acquiring a European Holster company. Commentary from the earnings call indicated this deal has moved slightly to the right and is now expected to close in early 2022. Management also highlighted that they expect to do 2-4 deals per year, depending on the size of the deals, and signaled conservatism toward inorganic growth - i.e. they won't make deals if they don't feel they have the capacity. Blast Sensors: Cadre has been in competition with another producer of blast sensors for an award with SOCOM to outfit soldiers to better study/understand traumatic brain injuries (TBls) resulting from explosions. Our main takeaway after speaking with management is that there will likely not be a winner until potentially 2023 and that the early stages of production would be for Special Forces. Penetration into other branches of the military would likely take time, but we continue to see this alternative use for blast sensors as a call option for the company that could have solid upside if they are successful. Tweaking Estimates, TP Remains $20: We make minor adjustments to our 2022 revenue and EBITDA estimates (partly to account for a slightly delayed acquisition timeline as well as more 4Q seasonality from the European Holster company) but continue to model to roughly management's most recent guidance. Potential items that could impact revenue would be COVID (though management noted no material impact, to this point), worsening crime statistics that could expedite law enforcement budget growth and future M&A, to name a few. We model adjusted EBITDA margins at 16.3% (2021E), 16.4% (2022E) and 17.8% (2023E).",Bert W. Subin,"Bert W.

Management had been highlighting this deal for the last couple of months, but the timing moved slightly to the right on slower negotiations. We believe the acquisition is a good first post-IPO purchase and expands the company's portfolio of duty holsters, belts and accessories with several international agencies (e.g. Police forces in Brazil, Belgium, Portugal, Norway, Holland, Malaysia). Similar to Cadre, Radar brings with it IP in firearm security systems so there is a focus on innovation and internal research. Radar also gives Cadre a modern factory with the capability to produce 500k units per year and the deal is expected to be immediately accretive.

CDW US,CDW,Dec 07 2021 05:16PM,CDW Corp.,Technology Supply Chain,"CDW: Raising Estimates to Reflect Sirius Acquisition; PT to $200, Maintain Hold rating ","We are raising our CDW estimates to account for the acquisition of Sirius Computer Solutions,Inc., which closed last week (Dec. 2, 2021). Under terms of the deal, CDW is paying $2.5bn in cash, or 10.4x 2021E adj. EBITDA ex-synergies. As we noted when the deal was first announced in October (link) we are positive on the deal, which further boosts CDW’s service and solutions capabilities in key areas such as hybrid infrastructure, security, digital transformation, cloud and managed services. We are modeling the deal to contribute $0.72 in adj-EPS accretion in 2022. We are raising our forward PT to $200 from $190, or ~22x our new FY22 EPS estimate of $9.05, a significant but deserved premium to industry peers. We maintain our Hold rating. ","Post-deal modeling assumptions. When it first announced the deal, CDW presented several key financial metrics for Sirius based on 2020 results, including sales (~$2bn), GM (28.2%) and non-GAAP operating margin (9.6%). CDW also disclosed, in a recent prospectus related to its debt financing, that Sirius' revenue for the first three quarters of FY21 was $1.583bn, with no comparisons for the same period in 2020. Based on that, we are modeling full-year 2021 growth for Sirius of ~5%. This is well below CDW’s expected organic growth in 2021, due to Sirius’ solutions focus, as major on-prem infrastructure projects have been slower to rebound during the pandemic, whereas demand for client devices (a sweet spot for CDW) has been quite strong. We are modeling ~5% top-line growth for Sirius in 2022, roughly in line with our CDW growth estimate. That estimate could end up being conservative if supply constraints ease and CDW is successful in cross-selling solutions. Below the operating line, we are raising our interest expense assumptions to account for the additional $2.5bn in debt on its balance sheet. Post deal, CDW's net leverage ratio is ~3.3x, with expectations to take that to below 3x by the end of 2022. We are also adjusting our assumptions on D&A and amortization of intangibles based on information provided in the debt prospectus. Our new estimates. Our 4Q’FY21 revenue and non-GAAP EPS estimates go from $5.126bn and $1.93 to $5.298bn and $2.02; our FY22 revenue and non-GAAP EPS estimates go from $21.491bn and $8.33 to $23.710bn and $9.05.",Matthew Sheerin,Matthew Sheerin,200,190,Hold,-,USD,9.05,8.33,,,,,23.71B,21.49B,,,,STIFEL_CDW_CoNote_2021-12-07.pdf,CDW_CoNote_2021-12-07,,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=a9324859-232c-45a0-b3bb-4761eddec39a&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

CGNT US,CGNT,Dec 21 2021 11:40AM,Cognyte Software Ltd.,Enterprise Software,Lower FY22 Outlook Weighs On Shares...TP to $26 ,"Cognyte reported F3Q22 results ahead of consensus expectations, on the heels of large dealvolume, with management noting multiple 7 and 8-figure deals. Despite the beat, management lowered FY22 revenue guidance by ~$10M due to implementation headwinds stemming from a resurgence in the pandemic limiting professional service employee travel as well as third-party component shortages preventing project go-lives. This marks the second consecutive quarter where the company faced some operational issues (deal slippage last quarter). Based on these recent business challenges we are taking a more conservative stance with our forward growth expectations, cutting our FY23E revenue growth outlook to the high single digits vs low teens previously. Given the decreased FY22E outlook and compression in the software group, we are decreasing our TP to $26.

Despite the company's out performance during the quarter, management cut its FY22 forecast, citing headwinds from timing of deployments in certain countries with recent surges of COVID as well as supply chain constrains for appliance components. During 3Q, software revenue as a % of total revenue decreased sequentially to 84.5% from 87.9%. While we expect the seasonally strong 4Q to be a tailwind to re-accelerating the software revenue mix shift, we note the headwinds referenced above will likely offset much of the seasonal benefit in 4Q. Looking forward, while management remains upbeat regarding the long-term demand environment, we note the company faces a very difficult software comp in 1Q, and when combined with the Covid and component issues, we are modeling flat Y/Y total revenue growth and a 3-4% decline in software revenue. We expect the combination of easing Covid & component challenges to ease over the course of the year and given the easier comps should lead to accelerating revenue growth over the course of FY23. However, the net impact is that we are reducing our FY23 revenue growth target to ~6% vs ~14% previously.",Brad R. Reback,"Brad R.

We believe CHX will continue to generate strong FCF, reduce debt levels, and will likely start returning excess cash to shareholders over the next several quarters. CHX remains one of our favorite names, and we reiterate our Buy with a $31 target price. ","Adjusting 4Q Estimates: We are lowering our 4Q21 revenue and EBITDA forecasts to $838.0 million and $130.1 million from $859.0 million and $135.8 million, respectively. Our revised forecasts are at the lower end of management's 4Q21 revenue guidance of $820 - 860 million and $130 - 140 million, respectively. The primary change to our 4Q21 estimate is due to a revision in our expectations for the Production Chemical Technologies (PCT) segment which is being impacted by both delivery bottlenecks and seemingly some normal lumpiness in quarterly sales. We are now expecting PCT revenue to edge up slightly sequentially versus our prior forecast for 5% sequential growth. We expect PCT EBITDA margins to improve sequentially due to price traction to 15.5% from 14.6% in 3Q21, 50 bps below our prior estimate. It appears that the company's Production & Automation Technologies business and its Drilling Technologies segment are both on track with our prior expectations. Keys to Buy Rating Intact: We continue to believe CHX is very well positioned to deliver strong revenue, earnings and free cash flow in 2022-23. The keys to our Buy rating include CHX's strong global Production Chemicals segment, its well-positioned Production Automation Technologies segment, its differentiated Drilling Technologies business, and its strong management team with a track record of consistent execution. We believe the company will continue to gain traction on revenue synergies from the merger, and we anticipate a capital return program to be put in place as robust free cash flow enables CHX to reduce debt to its targeted 1.0x ratio. Updated Estimates: We are lowering our 2021 EBITDA forecast to $453.2 million from $458.9 million due to the 4Q21 adjustments noted above, and our 2022-23 EBITDA forecasts are essentially unchanged at $582.0 million (versus $584.0 million) and $724.2 million (from $724.6 million).

CIR US,CIR,Dec 15 2021 05:01PM,"CIRCOR International, Inc.",Flow Control,"CIR: Management Meeting Takeaways; Growth and FCF Deferred to 2022 by Supply Chain, Fundamental Demand is Strong ","We maintain our Buy rating on CIR shares with a $41 target price. We were fortunate to hostCEO Scott Buckhout and CFO Abhishek Khandelwal for investor meetings this week. We come away believing business simplification/80-20 deployment presents a significant opportunity to focus the business where it generates the most profits and to improve or shed unprofitable business. Cash flow generation, along with EBITDA growth, in 2022 to deleverage the balance sheet will be critical to garnering investor interest. ","Onthe 3Q21 earnings call management decreased EPS guidance from $2. 10-$2.30 to $1.69- $1.74 and FCF conversion from ~95% to ~20%: The reduction in FCF conversion equates to ~$6 million and is related to milestone payments on large projects which were delayed due to supply chain disruptions. Management noted that these cash payments are expected to be additive to FCF in 2022 and FCF conversion in 2022 should be >100%. In our view, investors should expect to see these milestone payments in 1H22 driving much better than seasonal cash conversion. Provided supply chains begin to normalize in 2022 (by no means certain) we think investors should be expecting ~150% conversion, averaging to a more normal ~90% over the 2-year period. We think generating strong FCF in 2022 and consistent FCF thereafter is the number one requirement for the stock to work. The industrial business is later cycle, orders have been strong, and revenue conversion should follow in 2022: CIRCOR's industrial business sells custom products made to specification. This extends the order to ship time as the business holds very low finished inventory. This generates longer lead times and leaves the company more exposed to the current supply chain disruptions, the business can't hold much in the way of safety stock. Business simplification and 80-20 deployment offer the opportunity to focus on customers and products where growth and profitability is highest: Management noted that ~1/3 of the industrial portfolio currently generates mid 20% operating margins. This implies that the remainder of the segment generates no margin. Management believes there are significant opportunities to raise prices in low/no/negative margin businesses. Management noted one particular instance of a business losing money where it had doubled pricing and lost no volume (so was significantly under priced). We think the focus brought by 80-20 should allow CIRCOR to grow with its most important customers while reducing the cost to serve/pricing of smaller customers and drive significant margin expansion in the business over the next few years. Management believes the margin entitlement for the segment is in the high teens. 2019 margins had reached the low teens before COVID hit, and we don't think mid to high teens margins are out of the question.

CIVI US,CIVI,Dec 09 2021 05:43PM,"Civitas Resources, Inc.",Oil & Gas Exploration and Production,Mid-Cap Return of Capital Leader ,"With a best-in-class 2022 dividend yield of 8% (6x our peer group average of 1.3%) and solidbalance sheet (YE21 net debt/EBITDA of 0.5x vs peer average of 1.2x) CIVI is well-positioned to expand on its peer-leading return of capital commitment (50% of FCF) and/or further consolidate the DJ Basin. Following last month's merger close, we are updating our estimates based on recent well analysis and 4Q27 activity. ","Updating Estimates We are tweaking our NAV estimate/price target down 7%/7% to $100/$80 based on updated well analysis (Figure 1). The latter implies 42% potential upside to the stock's 12/09/21 closing price. Updating our 4Q21 average share count to reflect the 11/1/21 merger close (from 10/1/21 previously) causes us to raise our 4Q21E/2021E CFPS 27%/12% to $3.27/$11.19, 22%/12% below consensus. Notably, we believe some competitor estimates appear to incorrectly base 4Q21 production on a 10/1 merger close. We are increasing our 4Q21 capex estimate 14% to $190MM based on increased activity. As telegraphed on its 11/4/21 conference call, CIVI reduced the DUC count on legacy BCEI acreage and completed 16 wells in October, compared to the 3Q21 average of 7.5/month (Figure 2). Looking for Permit Approval Pace to Accelerate CIVI has 5 Oil & Gas Development Plans (OGDPs) in the completeness review stage and 2 (15- well Lone Tree North and 6-well Jet Fuel) undergoing technical review. CIVI has also submitted 160-well Comprehensive Area Plan (CAP), the Box Elder CAP, which is expected to reach the completeness review by YE21. Importantly, CIVI has surface agreements for most of the proposed locations. As of 12/8/21, only 7 industry-wide OGDPs have been approved in CO this year, while 10 have passed completeness and are under technical review (Figure 3). CIVI currently has over 250 permits in hand, or ~1.5 years of inventory based on the 2022 projected drilling pace. Management plans to submit at least one OGDP per month moving forward. We believe Colorado's permitting process remains an overhang on the stock. Western DJ Assets Could Boost Capital Efficiency The company plans to run 3/3 rigs/crews next year on its western and southern acreage. Both rank favorably to the primary DJ Basin competitor averages based on 12-month cumulative Boe/ft for wells completed in 2020-2021 (Figure 4). Notably, CIVI's western acreage yielded exceptional capital efficiency, with much better than average rates/ft despite longer laterals and lower proppant concentrations than most other areas. Older vintage wells (2018-2021) and longer-dated rates (18 months) show similar results (Figures 5 & 6). This year's western wells have slightly lagged prior-year vintages (Figure 7). However, we look for this trend to reverse sharply next year as the company focuses on legacy XOG acreage where rates have exceeded legacy Crestone Peak averages by ~50% (Figure 8). One of the company's 3 rigs is currently drilling in Broomfield where it is expected to remain through 3Q21. All of the new wells in the area (one of XOG's highest rate of return assets) are expected to be online by YE22. In the eastern area, this year's wells appear to be tracking the 2019 vintage and outperforming the 2020 and 2018 completions (Figure 9). One rig is currently operating on this legacy BCE| acreage although it is likely to move to the higher-return western properties next year. CIVI is also operating one rig in the southern area on legacy Crestone Peak acreage where well performance has been consistent over the past four years (Figure 10). Management has no near-term plans to drill CIVI's northern acreage where returns have been marginal (Figure 11).",Michael S. Scialla,Michael S.

CMG US,CMG,Dec 01 2021 05:37PM,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.",Restaurants & Franchised Businesses,CMG: Long-Term Outlook Intact as Investors Labor Over Margin Pressure ,"Our View: We reduced our near-term estimates to reflect a challenging operating environmentthat we believe will likely persist in 2022. We believe the Street's expectation for significant margin expansion in 2022 (~155 bps) is probably too aggressive given the company's exposure to labor and input cost pressures. Our projections assume MSD commodity and HSD/LDD wage inflation and menu pricing in the MSD range. Despite our near-term revisions, we remain bullish on Chipotle's long-term prospects of reaching 6,000 units in North America with at least $3M AUVs. The company expects to continue accelerating unit growth in 2022, with the bulk of new units skewed toward the higher-returning Chipotlane format. Based on this growth outlook and the recent underperformance in the shares, likely related to the near-term outlook, we view CMG as an increasingly attractive idea for investors with a 12+ month time horizon. ","We remain comfortable with our 4Q SRS estimate. Our recent review of mobile location data indicates sales have slowed since mid-November as the Smoked Brisket LTO rolled off menus. The company's low-to-mid double-digit SRS guidance for 4Q assumed that sales would slow from the start of the quarter (management indicated 4Q started similar to 3Q, implying up around 15%). The conclusion of the Brisket offering and lower net pricing (~7.5% in 4Q vs. 10% in 3Q) were expected to result in slower comps through the quarter. Given the sales strength in October and the indication these headwinds appear to be playing out over the back half of the quarter, we remain comfortable with our 13% SRS projection (Street 14.9%). We are moderating 2022 margin performance. In light of the challenging operational environment anticipated over the next few quarters, we adjusted our 2022 ROM assumptions to reflect higher commodity and wage inflation, particularly over the first two quarters of the year. Our projections also assume a pricing contribution of around 4-5%, resulting in relatively flat restaurant-level margin performance for the year (Stifel 22.5%, Street 24.3%) and our EPS estimate falling to $29.00 (previously $31.40). As a company-operated system, Chipotle will not be immune to ongoing tightness in the labor market or higher commodity prices amid supply chain challenges. Although the company has not communicated its 2022 pricing plans (no incremental pricing would mean 1Q pricing contribution approximates 5%), we believe it does have additional pricing power. Moreover, we expect the company to take a surgical approach to raise wages in markets where retention and recruiting metrics decline rather than pursue national starting wage or another national wage increase. Lastly, the margin should benefit from a greater mix of Chipotlane locations and continued recovery of the dine-in and take-out channels—both higher percent margins than delivery orders. Long-term growth profile intact. Despite moderating our outlook regarding the margin profile in 2022, we see little risk to the company's longer-term growth prospects. We remain confident in Chipotle's ability to reach 6,000 units in North America with AUVs above $3M. The share of development represented by Chipotlanes has continued to expand, with management indicating last quarter the mix on full-year development in 2021 should now exceed 75% (up from the previous 70% estimate), with the pipeline into 2022 continuing to strengthen. Should the mix of new Chipotlanes continue to represent around 75% of new units in 2022, we estimate the format could represent ~15% of total units by the end of next year. Chipotlanes require minimal additional investment relative to traditional stores ($75K-$85K) but drive 10-15% higher sales than traditional units at a significantly higher margin (we estimate over 200 bps), yielding an estimated year three cash-on-cash return of 60-70% on a ~$1M investment.",Chris O'Cull,"Chris O'Cull;Alec Estrada, CFA;Patrick Johnson",1950,2050,Buy,-,USD,,,,,,,8.75B,8.74B,,,,STIFEL_CMG_CoNote_2021-12-01.pdf,CMG_CoNote_2021-12-01,,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=d5e84786-2222-43c8-8012-525372344217&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
CMRE US,CMRE,Dec 09 2021 02:24PM,Costamare Inc.,Maritime,Shipping Misprices Options and Costamare Took Advantage ,"Today, Costamare announced the order of eight large new container ships backed by long-term contracts, and the acquisition of seven additional secondhand dry bulk vessels, bringing their exposure to that business up to 44 ships. Importantly, the containership orders are the result of the company exercising options that had been outstanding for several years, at prices substantially below current market levels. Pairing that against higher current charter rates, and we expect the unlevered returns on the vessels could be twice as high as those available in the market at the moment. Costamare has a long track record for being the best in the industry at deploying capital, and this is yet another example, on scale. ","New ships. On the container side, CMRE ordered two 13,000 TEU newbuilds, and exercised options for two additional 13,000 TEU and four 15,000 TEU newbuilds. All eight vessels will be locked into long-term charters upon delivery between 3Q21 and 1Q24. On the dry bulk side, CMRE acquired seven dry bulk vessels, with one already delivered, and the rest expected to be delivered over the next few months. Options. Not much color was provided on the purchase price, but the vessels were legacy option that had been part of a newbuilding project several years ago and based on those previous prices. Today a new 13,000 TEU vessel would cost about $140 million and a 15,000 TEU would be about $155 million, meaning an aggregate order price of about $1.2 billion for the eight ships. However, when the original order was made more than four years ago, the prices of those assets, and subsequently the options, would have been much less. We estimate about $95 million for a 13,000 TEU vessel and $115 million for 15,000 TEU vessel, implying an aggregate price between $800-$900 million. Contracts. Long-term contracts (north of 10 years) are generally priced against the cost of new assets, and in the current market generate unlevered rates of return of about 8%-9%. This would imply a contract rate in the mid to high $40,000/day range. We are assuming $43,000/day for the 13,000 TEU and $49,000 for the 15,000 TEU. Applying those rates to the asset prices we suspect the company was able to get as a function of their newbuilding options, we estimate the implied unlevered EBITDA return would be something like 15%. Considering the long-term nature of the contracts, which should support a reasonable amount of leverage, the return on equity for these assets is probably well north of 30%, and we expect the earnings accretion to be something like $0.50/share when they are operational in 2024. While we do expect container shipping rates to soften during that period, the addition of these vessels should meaningfully help offset any contract rollover risk. Capital. Based on current market prices, we expect the dry bulk ships are likely to have cost something like $160 million in aggregate. The company will make progress payments over the next several years on the containerships. We expect all of this should be funded through cash flow and incremental borrowing. By our math, that should cause debt to peak at about $2.4 billion. However, with the addition of the dry bulk vessels and the 47 new time charter contracts, we are modeling EBITDA above $800 million for the next several years making quick work of the incremental debt. While certainly the industry is peaking, given the very long tail of cash flow and robust Costamare balance sheet, we continue to expect further upside in share price.",Benjamin J. Nolan,"Benjamin J.

COHU US,COHU,Dec 15 2021 01:48AM,"Cohu, Inc.",Semiconductor Capital Equipment,Mid-Term Model Revisited and Revised Higher ,"In an 8-K filed after the close, Cohu updated its mid-term (3-5 year) financial model targets,increased to $1.0B revenue and $4.00 non-GAAP EPS (up from $940M and $3.60, respectively). Cohu attributed the higher trajectory to progress on several strategic fronts including design-in/ shipment momentum for its package inspection/metrology and automated test (ATE) systems, consumable-like test interface products, and synergistic analytical software. We believe this exemplifies how Cohu’s focus on SAM expansion growth initiatives continues to root, providing line-of-sight towards incremental revenue, margin and profitability. There was no update to Cohu’s 4Q21(Dec) guidance, but the release did add that “order demand remains strong” entering 2022. We are increasingly comfortable with our near-term estimates, particularly through 1H22 given our improving bias on test spending next year. In our view the stock’s ~50% discount to peers (CY22 EPS) is severe and neglects improvements in the company’s near-and-longer term model. We remain Buy rated. ","Progress over the mid-term. While cyclical demand for test handler systems was a driving force in 2021, it overshadowed progress the company has made on key non-handler system and recurring oriented growth initiatives meant to augment and improve the business model over time. We believe recent progress and continued product momentum underlies the company’s positive update to its mid-term target financial model. In systems, we are particularly encouraged by Cohu’s SAM gains in ATE and significant 2x growth in inspection (of packaged ICs) this year, which already approaches 10% of revenue (ex-PCB test). In recurring, we believe Cohu is on track to grow test interface sales at/above 20% this year and is seeing good early customer response to its new Dl-Core analytics software. Combined, these system and recurring revenue initiatives are additive to revenue but also accretive to GMs, with the updated target model also reflecting a 100bps higher GM of 49% at the $1B revenue level. Progress over the near-term. Excluding for the divested PCB test business, Cohu is on track to grow revenue mid-40% in 2021. And even with a sales mix skewing system and test handler heavy this year, non-GAAP earnings should still increase by nearly 3x. Looking ahead we remain confident that in spite of ongoing supply chain challenges, Cohu is on track to see an upward normalization in product mix (and GMs) moving through next year, with pickup in higher margin ATE and cost improvements in the test interface business, two key swing factors. From Cohu’s order comments, we would also infer that test cell utilization remains sturdy and this may tie into our separate test industry note in which we warm to the idea that broader test spend will be higher again in 2022, which could provide some positive bias to our near-term estimates.",Brian Chin,"Brian Chin, CFA;Patrick J.

COLM US,COLM,Dec 15 2021 10:35PM,Columbia Sportswear Company,Sports and Lifestyle Brands,Downgrading COLM to Hold on U.S. Inventory and Resulting Category Concerns; TP to $111 ,"We are reducing estimates for FY4Q21 and FY22, lowering our 12-mo. target to $111 from $126and downgrading shares to Hold from Buy. With unseasonably warm temperatures and late arrival of any measurable snowfall to key population centers in the U.S., we are concerned about U.S. wholesale channel partner and U.S. DTC sell-through of outerwear and boots season to date. In combination with supply chain delays and late arrival of goods across the industry, we see risk of an inventory overhang, promotional pressure to margin, and more subdued wholesale orders for 2H22. Our $111 target price reflects an 18x P/E on our FY23E EPS estimate of $6.17 (10x EV/FY23EBITDA of $663mn); (vs. prior $126 = 22.5X FY22 EPS of $5.60). ","Downgrade Rationale: We are downgrading shares to Hold from Buy and trimming our target price to $111 from $126. Our more cautious stance on shares reflects greater risk that carryover inventory from ’21 will weigh on fall ’22 orders and 2022 margins. Recall, with the Oct. 29 earnings call, the Company spoke of $100mn of shipments that shifted from 3Q to future quarters due to shipping delays. Late arrival of product in combination with unseasonably warm temperatures and lack of measurable snowfall in many important seasonal markets (see Appendix A) implies both risk to 4Q DTC productivity and potential for wholesale order cancellations. Checks on Columbia.com show unusual promotion on core men’s and women’s outerwear items and retailer checks show price breaks on private label brands suggesting sluggish category demand (national brand MAP price agreements still in place but retailers can promote own brands). Important drivers of 2021 margins to multi-year highs have been lower promotional activity, lower wholesale customer accommodations, and lower closeouts. Inventory excess carried into 2022 could cause these drivers to reverse. We note, these dynamics are not necessarily Columbia specific. Broader category influence could trigger reactive promotion that changes the competitive backdrop from the goldilocks conditions for full-priced selling in 2021. COLM has also been removed from Stifel’s select list. Estimate Revisions: We are reducing estimates to reflect lower revenue and gross margin in 4Q21 and FY22, which flow to lower FY23E estimates. Revised estimates are below consensus in each of these periods. $mn, except per share F4Q21E FY21E FY22E FY23E Sales New Stifel $1,053 $3,050 $3,522 $3,769 Prior Stifel $1,077 $3,074 $3,562 $3,812 Estimate Change -$24 -$24 -$41 -$43 Factset Consensus $1,070 $3,075 $3,518 $3,738 EPS New Stifel $1.70 $4.65 $5.38 $6.17 Prior Stifel $1.79 $4.75 $5.60 $6.42 Estimate Change -$0.10 -$0.10 -$0.22 -$0.25 Factset Consensus $1.79 $4.77 $5.52 $6.47 Source: Stifel estimates, Factset VALUATION: Our revised 12-month target price of $111 represents an 18x P/E on our FY23E EPS estimate of $6.17 or 10x EV/FY23EBITDA of $663mn (vs. prior target of $126 = 22.5X FY22EPS of $5.60),",Jim Duffy,"Jim Duffy;Peter McGoldrick, CFA",111,126,Hold,Buy,USD,5.38,5.6,6.17,6.42,,,3.52B,3.56B,3.77B,3.81B,,STIFEL_COLM_CoNote_2021-12-15.pdf,COLM_CoNote_2021-12-15,,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=fb951e9d-68c4-480d-893e-7d6d8a447a9b&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
COO US,COO,Dec 02 2021 09:16PM,Cooper Companies (The),Medical Technology & Supplies,FY22 Guidance Below Consensus But In-Line with Sentiment; Reiterate Buy ,"It was no secret that our/Street FY22 estimates were too high as FX recently moved againstCooper and management made clear that continued investing behind long-term growth drivers (myopia and fertility) was not going to be compromised. As a result, we view Cooper’s FY22 EPS guide of $13.60-14.00 largely in-line with “investor sentiment” despite consensus’ $14.54 (prior to print). On a good note, the F4Q21 results were relatively solid with revenue ahead of estimates, driven by CVI and while EPS of $3.28 missed Street by ~$0.10 half was due to FX with the balance attributable to accelerated investments. We continue to take a longer- term view and believe that 1) CVI’s core lens and MM portfolio positions the company well for continued share gains; and 2) CSI’s portfolio has been strengthened and sentiment around the recent Generate deal may improve offlows (management already walked up year-1 accretion expectations). Reiterate Buy. ","CVI. CVI posted revenue of $565MM in the quarter, solidly above our $552MME, with the entirety of the beat attributable to outperformance in the EMEA region ($214MM vs. our $201MME). Full year MiSight sales of $19MM (+149% y/y) were short of the company’s $20MM target, however continued momentum across all channels and progress in China (distribution agreement with EssilorLuxottica; soft launch in November with full launch expected in F2Q22) gives management confidence in their $100MM+ FY22 revenue target for the entire myopia management portfolio. The company also launched SightGlass, their myopia management glasses solution, in Europe last month in partnership with EssilorLuxottica, however U.S. approval is unlikely in the near-term. CSI. Revenue for the quarter was $194MM (+11% CC y/y) driven by continued strength in Fertility. Revenue was sightly below our $197MME, as PARAGARD declined -17% CC due to the buy-in activity last quarter ahead of an announced price increase and a softer end market. Total Office and Surgical revenue of $113MM was up +3% y/y CC. Generate Life Sciences. Management updated their first year accretion estimate from Generate Life Sciences (acquisition announced in November) from $0.30 to $0.50, citing favorable cost of capital developments. Generate Life Sciences has ~$250MM of TTM revenue, and gross margin is expected to be approximately 70%. Management is optimistic that they will close the deal in coming weeks with accretion increasing in year two as synergies are realized. Guidance.

COST US,COST,Dec 01 2021 06:45PM,Costco Wholesale Corporation,Hardlines Retail,Solid November Comp Results Shy of Elevated Expectations; Moderating Inflation Notable ,"Costco reported total and U.S. core November comp growth of 9.2% and 9.1%, compared toconsensus of 10% and 11%, respectively. Sales growth remains robust, with the 2-year comp CAGR remaining at low-double-digits, driven by strength across categories. Compositionally, traffic increased 6% globally and 3% in the U.S., while global ticket grew 8%, lapping mid-to- high-single-digit traffic and ticket growth in the year-ago period. E-commerce growth was up 12% y/y, lapping 71% in the year ago period, which indicates ongoing digital shopping adoption/ penetration. We think the sequential deceleration in the 2-year comp CAGR in November reflects commentary that inflation moderated compared to October, impacting ticket growth, and some pull-forward of holiday sales into October. We continue to view Costco as a best-in-class retailer and a core holding for large-cap consumer investors. We lift F2022-F2023 estimates slightly and our target price to $550, 40x F2023E EPS and maintain our Buy rating. ","Additional November comp thoughts. The November sales result demonstrates the ability of the business to effectively “comp the comps”, posting strong growth despite lapping double- digit compares in the prior year period, with the core comp 2-year CAGR remaining elevated in the low-double-digit range for the past eleven months. Further positive, although the company continues to see above average inflationary pressure throughout the business, there was evidence of moderation in November versus the prior month. Notably, major categories (ex- ancillary) increased mid-single-digits to low-double-digits off more difficult comparisons in the prior year period. Indicative of economic re-opening, ancillary services increased more than 50%, driven by gasoline and food court. We believe Costco remains a best-in-class retailer, with continued reinvestment appropriate to sustain outperformance of peers. We anticipate the company will continue to invest in price and e-commerce to reinforce its value proposition, which we view as key to sustaining favorable comp and traffic trends and continued outperformance of peers. Amid an inflationary backdrop, Costco has effectively balanced sales growth and profit in recent quarters with reinvestment. We anticipate this trend will continue, driving high single-digit operating income growth over the next 2-3 years. Other highlights: E-commerce. Comparable e-commerce growth was 11.7% in November, compared to 15.3% in October, 9.6% in September, and 1.8% in August. Notably, comparable e-commerce growth in the year-ago period was 70.9%. International. The strongest regions were Mexico, Taiwan, and Japan. Foreign exchange impacted total company comp positively by 300bps, Canada positively by 470bps, and Other International negatively by 250bps. Traffic. Global traffic increased 5.5%, decelerating ~90bps sequentially on a 2-year basis. U.S. traffic was up 3.3%, a ~120bp sequential deceleration on a 2-year basis. Average global transaction growth was up 8.1% y/y, decelerating ~160bps on a 2-year basis, including the positive impacts from gasoline inflation and FX. Category highlights: Food & Sundries. Comp rose mid-single-digits,compared to high-single-digit growth in October. Categories of strength included candy, frozen, and deli. Management noted that while the company continues to see inflation, especially within fresh foods and food and sundries, the impact of inflation was moderate in comparison to October. Fresh Foods. Comp rose mid to high-single-digits, compared to high-single-digit growth in October’s results, with strong performance in service, deli and bakery.",Mark S. Astrachan,"Mark S.

COST US,COST,Dec 09 2021 07:32PM,Costco Wholesale Corporation,Hardlines Retail,"EPS Beat Driven by SG&A Leverage and Comp Growth, Potential Gross Margin Trough; Maintain Buy ","Costco reported F1Q22 EPS above consensus reflecting strong sales/comp growth and SG&Aexpense leverage. While core-on-core gross margin decreased 18bps y/y, the rate of decline improved sequentially relative to F4Q21, a trend that management suggested could continue in F2Q22. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 90bps, with core SG&A expenses down 11bps ex-gas despite wage increases. Membership renewal rates increased 60bps and 70bps y/y globally and in U.S./Canada and 30bps sequentially, and members-per-club and sales-per-member increased 3% and 10% y/y, respectively. Overall strong comp growth remains most notable and we think share gains should result in continued leverage, especially of SG&A expenses, and which should drive operating margin expansion from current levels. Additional catalysts over the next 12-months include announcing a membership fee increase and a special dividend. We lift our F2022-F2023 EPS estimates and maintain our Buy rating and $555 target, 40x F2023E EPS. ","Membership fee_increase, special dividend catalysts. We estimate Costco will announce a membership fee increase of ~8% sometime over the next 12-months based on an analysis of prior fee increases beginning in 2006. For more details, please see our note. We also think the company is likely to use its increasing cash balance to pay a special dividend over the next 12- months, which follows a $10/share dividend paid in December 2020. Specifically, Costco’s cash balance at F1Q22 of $13.5bn compares to $14.4bn at the end of F1Q21, when the prior special dividend was paid, and a projected F2022 yearend cash balance of $15.8bn. Inflation up from September, mostly passing CPG pricing through to consumers. Costco said inflation has increased (no kidding!) to 4.5%-5.0%, up from 3.5%-4.5% in September, 2.5%-3.5% as of late May and 1.0%-1.5% in March. Consistent with history, the company said it aims to increase prices at a rate below competitors/inflation and offset cost pressures through merchandising strategies. That said, we think the company is generally passing through pricing on CPG categories. By category, the company said core-on-core gross margin improved in non- foods and decreased slightly in food and sundries, with fresh foods the primary driver of declines as it laps year ago productivity and low spoilage. Core on core gross margin down, but less than last quarter. Core on core merchandise (Food and Sundries, Fresh Food, Hardlines, Softlines) margin declined 18bps y/y, versus a 40bps y/ decline the previous quarter. Management cited the decline in fresh foods as a primary driver for the lower core on core margin, as fresh foods faced difficult y/y labor productivity and low product spoilage comparisons. Non-foods experienced slight growth while sundries was slightly lower y/y. Overall, gross margin ex. membership of 11.06% decreased 49bps y/y (-6bps y/y when excluding the impact of gas inflation), modestly ahead of our estimate of 10.95%. Core margin declined 63bps y/y, or -26bps when excluding the impact of gas inflation. Positive to margin, ancillary businesses’ gross margin, which includes gas sales, increased 2bps y/y, or +12bps when excluding the impact of gas inflation. With ongoing supply chain pressure and input inflation, now estimated at 4.5%-5.0%, the company is navigating the environment better than most in our view, being deliberate in its approach to offset incremental costs, consistent with history, while continuing its digital/e-commerce focus, both serving to reinforce the value proposition, which we view as key to sustaining favorable comp and traffic trends and continued outperformance relative to peers.

CPB US,CPB,Dec 08 2021 06:17PM,Campbell Soup Company,Food,Inflation Pressure in Near-Term — Pricing and Cost Savings Support Outlook ,"Campbell reported 1Q22 EPS of $0.89, down 12% and $0.05 ahead of our estimateincluding a $0.04 benefit from a lower tax rate. Organic sales were down 4%, which was below our estimate against the tough comparison that included some inventory recovery. Soup sales were down 2%, a sequential improvement due to the comps, and demand remains elevated overall. Campbell reiterated its sales guidance and updated its profit guidance to exclude mark to market profit effects. We are raising our FY22 EPS estimate by $0.02 to $2.80 reflecting the outperformance here in the first quarter, partially offset by a weaker outlook for the second quarter. Campbell upsized its cost savings program, up $150 million to $1 billion, and we expect to get more details on the timing and reinvestment needs during its Investor Day scheduled for next week. We continue with our Hold rating and $44 target price. ","Campbell announced a second price increase effective near the end of the second quarter. The company continues to forecast high-single digit inflation for the year, and it expects its pricing, cost savings, and productivity programs to offset input cost inflation in the second half. As such, we estimate a sequentially weaker second quarter in terms of profit before improvement takes hold in the second half. Campbell reiterated its sales guidance and updated its profit guidance to exclude the impact of mark to market. Organic sales are expected to be in the range of -1% to +1%, an EBIT decline of -4.5% to -1.5%, and EPS in the range of -4% to flat — these ranges are consistent with previous guidance excluding mark to market. We are raising our FY22 EPS estimate by $0.02 to $2.80 reflecting the outperformance here in 1Q22, partially offset by a weaker outlook in 2Q22. Campbell will host a virtual investor day on December 14‘. where we believe the company will highlight the success in household penetration and market share gains during the pandemic, officially increase the size of its cost savings program, unveil the margin opportunity in its Snacking business, and reiterate its long-term guidance (sales up LSD, EPS up HSD). The company upsized its cost savings program, up $150 million to $1 billion, and we expect to get more details next week on the timing and reinvestment needs. We believe the majority of the savings will accrue in the Snacks division, where we expect Campbell to unlock margin potential — we estimate there is roughly 300 to 400 bps of margin potential in this division as the company closes the gap to its peers. We continue with our Hold rating and $44 target price, which we derive by assigning an 11x EV/EBITDA multiple to our calendar 2022 EBITDA estimate, placing the shares at a 10% discount to its peers. We believe this discount is appropriate as the company laps difficult comparisons while contending with rising input cost inflation and labor constraints, which we expect will cause a sequential gross margin decline in the second quarter before second round of pricing takes effect.",Christopher R.

CPB US,CPB,Dec 14 2021 07:42PM,Campbell Soup Company,Food,"Balance, and the Path to Achieving its New LT Growth Algorithm ","Campbell Soup hosted its virtual investor day today outlining its path forward for thebusiness and its expectations for growth through FY25. The plan the company outlined was generally in line with our expectations as the company has teased parts of its outlook in recent quarters. A stepped up cost savings plan, a margin expansion opportunity in the Snacks division, and an enhanced margin opportunity in the Meals and Beverages division support the company’s new long-term goals of growing sales 2%, EBIT 4%-6%, and EPS 6%-8%. The company is implementing a new $150 million cost savings program, part of the plan to achieve its enhanced margin profile and EPS growth. The company expects to achieve this new algorithm starting in FY24. We expect strategic M&A (tuck-ins), share repurchase ($200 million annually), and some debt reduction to represent the main uses of cash through FY25. We continue with our Hold rating. ","The company’s focus over the next four years is on the margin profile of the business with an expectation of maintaining 1% or so sales growth for its Meals and Beverages division and 3% or so sales growth for its Snacks division. The company expects 400bps of margin improvement in Snacks and 250bps for its Meals and Beverages division. The company’s new long-term growth algorithm represents a slight adjustment to its previous targets, but a level that the company has not achieved in many years outside of those months incorporating the early stage of the pandemic. While we have increased confidence in this management team’s execution, this is no doubt an uphill climb. And, we see some top-line growth risk over these next few years as the margin targets take center stage. This could keep the company short of its 2% organic sales growth outlook. The margin target is enhanced by an incremental $150 million in cost savings as well as some margin recovery in its Snacks business related to the pandemic and pricing to inflation. The Snacks division is expected to move from a 13% operating margin to nearly 17% in FY25, and this roughly $200 million of incremental profit (75% of total profit growth) will be largely supported by the cost savings program. Campbell is committed to its three DSD systems and noted some future margin opportunity from better managing those systems. The Meals and Beverages division should sustain a 1% top-line growth profile as the company seeks to be competitive across each of its businesses, including soup. The sauces business is in focus, with a goal of moving up 25% to $1 billion, and innovation behind its Pacific Foods brand should aid its growth too. We expect small tuck-in acquisitions in sauces to help achieve its goal. We estimate $1 billion of annual operating cash flow and roughly $1.5 billion of free cash flow over these next four years. We believe share repurchase activity ($650 million) and debt reduction ($650 million) will represent the main areas of cash use over this time. We estimate the company ending with a 2x debt/EBITDA ratio assuming no M&A activity.",Christopher R. Growe,"Christopher R. Growe;Matthew E. Smith, CFA;Bradley J.

CPT US,CPT,Dec 07 2021 12:30AM,Camden Property Trust,Multifamily REITs,Initiating Coverage Of Camden Property Trust With A Buy Rating ,"We are initiating coverage of Camden Property Trust with a Buy rating. Camden has a highquality portfolio located in the Sunbelt, is a prolific developer, and has a sector-leading balance sheet. Our target price of $192 equates to a 3.9% implied cap rate on 2023 NOI. ","What Is CPT? Camden owns a geographically-diverse portfolio of multifamily properties mostly focused in the Sunbelt in markets that display strong economic growth balanced against an attractive quality of life. The company feels these market characteristics will drive strong demand for their communities while also bolstering tenant retention. To that point, as of 3Q21, the company’s largest markets based on NOI contribution are Washington D.C. (15.5%), Houston (10.7%), Phoenix (8.4%), and Atlanta (7.9%). Active Capital Recycler. Camden has been active in recycling capital over the past 10 years in order to enhance the quality of its portfolio. During this time, the company has sold $3.1 billion of assets with acquisitions totaling $2.7 billion and development spend of $4.1 billion. We believe these actions have set up the company’s portfolio well in terms of quality, given the disposition assets had an average age of 23 years at time of sale, and the acquisitions and developments had average ages of four years and five years respectively. Additionally, given CPTs strong disposition program, the company has seen minimal cash flow dilution over the previous 10 years. Co-Founders Still Running The Ship. Camden has an experienced management team, with extensive experience in the multifamily and overall REIT space. The company is led by CEO and chairman Richard Campo and Keith Oden, Executive Vice Chairman of the board and President, who co-founded Camden in 1982, and has helped grow the company from a Houston-focused company to a nationally diverse REIT. Introducing Estimates, Strong Growth CAGR. We are introducing our 2021, 2022, and 2023 FFO estimates of $5.41, $6.33, and $7.10. Of note, we are above with the Street in terms of 2022 and 2023 FFO estimates and believe numbers are likely to move higher over the coming months. When looking at future growth, over the next two years our estimates show CPT’s normalized FFO growing at a 14.6% CAGR from 2021-2023. This compares to sector average two-year CAGR of 11.0%. Dividend. CPT's annualized dividend of $3.32 represents a 2.0% dividend yield and a 59.0% 2022 FAD payout rate. We believe that this dynamic could allow the dividend to grow ata greater rate relative to peers over the next two years.",Simon Yarmak,"Simon Yarmak, CFA;Connor Shockley, CFA",192,,Buy,Suspended,USD,,,,,,,,,,,,STIFEL_CPT_CoNote_2021-12-07.pdf,CPT_CoNote_2021-12-07,,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=6ee37329-f97c-4ffd-9174-6e3ede89553c&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

Enterprise Momentum Drives Record ARR of $1.51B ,"CrowdStrike posted F3Q22 results that exceeded consensus estimates, as the companyrecorded another quarter of strong ARR growth, surpassing the $1.5B ARR mark for the first time. The strong results were driven by CrowdStrike's ability to source ARR from new customers (especially enterprise customers, with record $1M ARR deals) and expanding penetration across its install base. Looking forward, management was upbeat regarding their Federal opportunity, noting a large, multi-year, win for multiple Federal agencies. We continue to believe CRWD's growth opportunity remains in the early days, especially given the ample runway remaining to source incremental ARR from new customers across its core endpoint security market. Net/net, we believe the company's growing product set should expand its competitive moat over time, and should enable CRWD to sustain 40%+ y/y ARR growth over the next several years. That said, we are reducing our TP to $285 given recent multiple compression across the group.

The strong ARR growth during the quarter was driven by a combination of net new customer adds (CRWD added >1,600 net new customers for the second quarter in a row), especially on the enterprise front with a record number of $1M ARR deals, as well as the degree to which CrowdStrike has succeeded in increasing multi product adoption (record highs in customers that have adopted 4, 5, and 6 or more modules)",Brad R.

CSGS US,CSGS,Dec 12 2021 07:02PM,CSG Systems International,Software: Applications,CSG Systems and the Road to Two Billion: Notes From the Virtual Road ,"On Thursday afternoon, we hosted a virtual non-deal roadshow with CEO Brian Shepherd, newCFO Hai Tran, and Head of IR John Rea of CSG Systems. The company has been outspoken about its growth acceleration over the last two quarters, targeting a long-term goal of $2bn in annual revenue in five years. While this may be a stretch goal that will require the underpinnings of M&A, the company has shown an acceleration in growth in recent quarters and is consistently winning subscribers, recently signing contract extensions with Charter and DISH, two of its largest customers. We believe CSGS will continue to execute with its SaaS platform based approach to diversify its customer base, while adding additional solutions such as payments and analytics to grow the top-line while managing profitability to stay within historical levels. We maintain our Buy rating and $65 price target. ","There will be no year-end scramble as CSG has already signed contract extensions with key customers in Charter and DISH. The day before CSG Systems announced its 3Q21 earnings results, it announced a 4.5 year contract extension with DISH. The company will remain DISH's revenue management provider of choice to continue a relationship that has lasted over 25 years to date. CSG then one-upped themselves as it also announced a six-year contract extension (concurrent with 3Q earnings) as the billing solution of choice for Charter's residential and SMB internet businesses, as well as video and landline voice customers. The contract also included the conversion of 13mn subscribers on the CSG platform from competitors like Netcracker/Convergys (which historically owned the majority of the Time Warner subscribers). The company is prepared to absorb both of these renewals (that historically pressure the top and bottom-line for one to two years), while still showing top line growth in FY22 and beyond, and while staying comfortably within its long- term target of 16%-18%. The company's platform approach is creating diversification from telecommunications and cable. While telecommunications remains a fast growing and robust opportunity, CSG has leveraged its platform approach to appeal to more verticals like government, retail, healthcare, technology, and financials. The scalability of the CSG platform has helped gain interest from large telecommunications providers and enterprise customers that require billing support, among other companies outside these verticals. JPMorgan Chase utilizes CSG's fraud alert notification software and also uses its analytics solution. Three of the largest pharmaceutical retailers are customers of CSG to help drive positive customer engagement. The revenue contribution from verticals outside of cable and telecom has grown from a historical 7% to over 24% at the end of 3Q21. We expect this trend to continue as CSG continues to defend its North American cable market share of 70% and expand its platform through strategic acquisitions and product development. We look at the recent acquisition of Kitewheel - an orchestration platform that is designed to break down internal silos to consolidate customer information and determine the proper communication path for customer engagement - as a prime example of a crossover platform that can be beneficial to CSG's cable and wireless customers, while also driving leverage into the verticals mentioned above that the company is finding success in. We additionally look at the appointment of Mr. Tran, the company's new CFO, who brings expertise from the healthcare and life sciences fields, as perhaps a reasonable suggestion that the company will look to add resources in these verticals that are indeed showing interest in the stable of payments, analytics and orchestration products that CSG is bringing to the fold.",Tom M.

CTAS US,CTAS,Dec 22 2021 02:29PM,Cintas Corporation,Business & Information Services,"Post Call Thoughts: General Trajectory Seems Consistent with Prior Expectations, Company Executing Well ","We believe the company is on a solid trajectory, benefiting from the economic improvements/reopening and hiring together with the company’s internal efforts to generate new business, primarily from converting “no programmers” to “programmers”. We are making only modest tweaks to our estimates, largely to reflect the F2Q22 outperformance and the expectation for a tougher YOY comp in F3Q22 from PPE sales in F3Q21. We are raising our target price to $415, reflecting higher multiples since CTAS seems to trade inline with the high quality Info Services comps (despite being a route-based business), and the valuations in that group have increased. ","We believe the company is on a solid trajectory, benefiting from the economic improvements/ reopening and hiring together with the company’s internal efforts to generate new business, primarily from converting “no programmers” to “programmers”. The Omicron variant does not seem to be having an impact on the business, and the company noted that their customers seem to be treating it with a business as usual attitude. The company overall continues to see operational improvement as the economy reopens, and although there is some caution around the Omicron variant, operating trends continue to improve. While there are inflationary pressures (freight, energy, supplies, etc.), the company seems to be managing through them well, and the additional labor costs were noted as investments to service existing and anticipated growth rather than reflective of wage inflation. There appears to be more room left in the recovery with 4M less jobs today vs. pre-pandemic levels and 11M job openings. Competitively, CTAS is not running into ARMK more often despite the turnaround efforts at ARMK since CTAS is more focused on the “no programmer” business development — and ARMK tells us they are focused on that as well (the focus from both companies is on whitespace rather than taking business from each other). We are making only modest tweaks to our estimates, largely to reflect the F2Q22 outperformance and the expectation for a tougher YOY comp in F3Q22 from PPE sales in F3Q21. We are raising our target price to $415, reflecting higher multiples assumed for the valuation. Despite being a route-based company, CTAS seems to trade inline with the Info Services comp valuations (likely due to the execution track record and consistent outperformance), and we are applying current CY22 EV/EBITDA and P/E average valuations to our CTAS estimates to generate our target price. Incremental Call Items Include: CTAS continues to manage labor well despite a tough operating environment with inflationary wages. The company has been proactively increasing its wage over the last several years so the wage inflation is less impactful to it. The labor investments noted are to match labor needs with current and anticipated revenue growth. The company is focused on investments, particularly through technology/automation. This area is a top priority for CTAS as a way to drive efficiencies through the business. One example includes Smart Truck technology where CTAS collects truck data to plan more efficient routing. We understand that the company has been pursuing these types of efficiency investments (particularly routing) for years, and we expect the operational improvements to be more evolutionary. There is still room left in Covid recovery. There are still 4M less jobs than prior to the pandemic’s onset, and there are 11M job openings. Increased hiring potential at existing clients should remain a tailwind for growth for a while, and we note that additional uniform wearers at existing clients is generally high-margin business since it doesn’t require additional sales efforts or additional stops along the route.",Shlomo H.

CTRA US,CTRA,Dec 15 2021 07:25PM,Coterra Energy Inc.,Oil & Gas Exploration and Production,Room for Buyback to Complement 2022 Peer-Leading Dividend ,"With a top-tier 2022 dividend yield of 9% (nearly 2x our peer group average of 5.3%) and solidbalance sheet (YE21 net deb/EBITDA of 0.6x vs peer average of 1.1x) CTRA is well-positioned to lead our bellwether peer group in returning capital to shareholders next year. In our view, a meaningful share buyback program could complement this plan. After accelerating its first variable dividend to 4Q21 from 1Q22, the company is set to return 49% of its 2021 FCF to investors, the highest in our group. ","Return of Capital Plan Assuming CTRA returns 50% of our 2022 FCF estimate (vs management's target of 50%+), we project a 2022 dividend yield of 9%, 2nd highest in our bellwether peer group (Figure 1). Based on recent strip prices (12/15/21), the dividend yield would be 7%. Our model currently assumes the other 50% of 2022E FCF is added to the balance sheet in the form of cash. Management noted that it may look to reduce debt to $2.0B from $2.9B. However, with $2.6B of liquidity, including $1.1B of cash (as of 9/30/21), and the nearest material debt maturity in 2024 (Figure 2), debt reduction will likely rank lower on the priority list than dividends and share buybacks. We believe the latter could play a meaningful role in next year's plan to return capital as it could have a more lasting impact on the share price than a variable dividend. Updating Estimates We are lowering our NAV estimate/price target 4%/4% to $33/$26 based on tweaks to our type curves (Figure 3). Our target implies 28% potential upside to the stock's 12/15/21 closing price. We believe that the market is increasingly valuing our sector on its FCF generation potential. Based on Street consensus estimates, 10 sectors have an average 2023E FCF/EV yield of 4.2%. Based on a 6% FCF/EV yield, CTRA's implied stock price of $39.49/share suggests potential upside of 94% (Figure 4). We are also updating our 2022E oil production forecast to reflect a sequential decline from 4Q21 to 1Q21 followed by a gradual increase over the balance of the year. Our 4Q22 oil estimate is flat with 4Q21, in line with guidance. The change causes us to lower our 2022E CFPS 1% to $5.25, 3% below consensus. Delaware Well Performance Among Best in Basin We anticipate CTRA will operate an average of 6 rigs and 2 completion crews next year in the Delaware Basin. In 2021, the company spent the majority of its Delaware Basin capex in Culberson and Reeves counties, TX, followed by Lea and Eddy counties, NM. CTRA's Culberson County well productivity has remained fairly consistent over the past 3 years, albeit down significantly from 2018 (Figure 5). Over the past 4 years, the company's wells have had the highest 18-month cumulative oil/ft average of the largest operators in the county (Figure 6). CTRA's Reeves County well performance has been consistent over the past four years (Figure 7), roughly inline with the average of its competitors although the company has drilled slightly longer than average laterals and used less proppant (Figure 8). In Eddy County, CTRA's 2020 wells are lagging prior-year vintages (Figure 9) while the 18- month average Boe/ft of its 2018-2021 wells was higher than its competitors (Figure 10). In Lea County, the company's wells have improved each of the last 3 years (Figure 11), and its 2018-2021 18-month average Boe/ft was best in the county (Figure 12).",Michael S. Scialla,Michael S.

Management stated this is expected to put additional pressure on gross margins in the 1H22 as older priced backlog continues to roll through the P&L before increased pricing takes effect later in F2022 and early F2023. Management again noted having greater success in passing through pricing in this cycle than in previous cycles. That said, management stated the full impact of the pricing benefits may take longer to materialize due to certain large OEM customers. Outside of large OEM customers, Donaldson is having ongoing success in implementing price increases across the industrial segment as well as the independent aftermarket channel in Engine. During the quarter, management said nearly half of Off-Road growth was driven by the lower margin exhaust and emissions business, which reflected a production ramp-up related to new emission standards in Europe. Management continues to anticipate this business to contribute to a mix headwind on gross margin in F2022. Overall, Management is guiding to gross margin down 50 to 100bps vs. flat to slightly down previously and management doesn't anticipate the company to be able to fully offset the impact of inflation in F2022. Engine: Management believes On-Road will be under additional pressure for the remainder of the year as many customers continue to struggle with supply chain issues including the persistent chip shortage. Management expects On-Road to be down low single digits vs. up low single digits previously for F2022. Management is increasing its expectations in Engine Aftermarket to high single- digit growth from mid-single-digit growth as equipment utilization remains strong, and Donaldson is continuing to gain share with its proprietary products. IFS: Management noted that revenue related to the recent Solaris acquisition will not be material in F2022 with bookings for the year expected to be ~11 million, and revenue related to those bookings expected to flow through over the next several quarters. Management notes the Solaris acquisition marks the first stepping stone into life sciences and provides the opportunity for the company to leverage Solaris’ technology and customer relationships to advance Donaldson's capabilities in this space.",Nathan Jones,"Nathan Jones, CFA;Adam M.

DNOW US,DNOW,Dec 12 2021 05:28PM,NOW Inc.,Specialty Distribution,DNOW: Transforming the Model to Drive Profitability and Cash Flow; 1-on-1 with DNOW's CEO and CFO ,We maintain our Buy rating with an $11 target price on DNOW shares. We were fortunate tohost investors with CEO Dave Cherechinsky and CFO Mark Johnson at DNOWs headquarters in Houston. We come away confident that the business transformation underway will result in higher levels of profitability at the same levels of revenue and that improved inventory management could result in better-than-expected cash generation. ,"Customers are being more measured with capital deployment: Investors have forced discipline on E&P companies, and DNOW's customers are being more measured with capital spending increases. Management still expects revenue growth of >10%, and we got the sense management is very confident of growth of at least that much. Management views $70 bbl oil as healthy for growth in investment in 2022 and beyond. Management noted heading into 2022 with a lot of optimism. Transforming the model to optimize expenses while remaining close to the customer: DNOW is standing up 3 new super centers in Texas, Wyoming, and North Dakota, which will allow it to continue to shrink the footprint of its branch network. Management plans to continue to shrink the square footage, number of vehicles, and employees at branch locations, further enabled by the regional super centers, enabling it to stay close to customers while carrying less total inventory and reducing costs. Along with lower WSA expenses from the reduced footprint, the super centers are expected to increase inventory turnover and cash flow. Super center structure should improve velocity and reduce inventory write-off charges: Historically management believes the branches had too much autonomy to buy and hold inventory which led, in some cases, to branches overbuying inventory and potentially buying the wrong (slow moving) inventory. Management believes centralizing the purchasing decisions will lead to more optimal levels and velocity of inventory. This leads to reduced cash flow from suboptimal inventory levels and also to increased inventory write-offs, particularly during downturns. To illustrate, management noted that of the expected $57 million EBITDA loss in 2021, $54 million is related to inventory write-offs. Management is committed to higher levels of profitability at similar levels of revenue: Technology advancements in drilling and production have structurally reduced DNOWs upstream addressable market, and the company is responding by reducing costs significantly. CEO Dave Cherechinsky has consistently stated his view that the company should be profitable at the bottom of the cycle, and the continuing transformation of the cost structure in the business model is designed to achieve this goal.",Nathan Jones,"Nathan Jones, CFA;Adam M.

DRI US,DRI,Dec 17 2021 03:15PM,"Darden Restaurants, Inc.",Restaurants & Franchised Businesses,DRI: Outperformance Is In Darden's Genes ,"Our View: Darden reported F2Q EPS of $1.48 (Stifel $1.50, Street $1.43) as stronger revenueand lower G&A and marketing expense offset restaurant margin pressure driven by higher-than- anticipated inflation. Management raised its guidance ranges for full-year comps and revenue while essentially maintaining earnings ranges and emphasizing its commitment to delivering on its long-term margin commitment of 200-250 bps of EBITDA margin improvement relative to pre- COVID levels. In addition to the earnings report, the company also announced CEO Gene Lee's intent to retire at the end of the fiscal year (May), which we believe had more impact on today's share price movement. Lee has guided the company with a steady hand since taking the helm seven years ago, and the company has benefited from his expertise as an operator. As CEO, DRI's TSR was ~21%, handily outperforming the S&P 500's 14% return over the same period. ","F2Q SRS accelerated at Olive Garden. Olive Garden reported comps up 29.3% (Stifel 26%, Street 25.3%), accelerating to 5% above pre-COVID levels from flat last quarter despite lapping nine weeks of Never Ending Pasta Bowl promotion. Improvements in staffing levels, and therefore greater capacity in peak periods, helped the brand overcome the difficult lap. Overall staffing levels across the enterprise improved to 95% of pre-COVID levels in F2Q from 90% last quarter, and management added that operational simplification and productivity enhancements had reduced the total staff needed relative to pre-pandemic norms, implying the company is close to its optimal staffing levels. In addition, newer employees quickly moving up the learning curve also expanded Olive Garden's ability to manage more volume at peak times. The investments in core menu quality and ongoing abundance (i.e., the never-ending first course) have also started to pay dividends, with guests providing high-value ratings and positive feedback on satisfaction surveys. Off-premise sales are proving sticky. The to-go sales mix held steady at Olive Garden (28% vs. 27% last quarter) and LongHorn (flat to last quarter at 15%), with roughly 60% of off-premise orders coming through digital channels. Management had previously indicated a belief that off- premise volumes would ultimately settle around 20%, but recent performance suggests that it could be higher. The company's investments in technology and process enhancements that remove friction from the off-premise experience have proven effective in retaining customers, and management indicated users had increased frequency as the experience improved. While the company still expects to get back to pre-COVID levels of on-premise traffic at some point, the timing remains uncertain. Across the system, on-premise traffic remains down in the single- digit range to pre-COVID. Still, management highlighted LongHorn as having already exceeded pre-pandemic levels, suggesting there could be considerable variation between brands.

DRI US,DRI,Dec 21 2021 07:00PM,"Darden Restaurants, Inc.",Restaurants & Franchised Businesses,DRI: Upgrading to Buy; Target Price $165 ,"Our View: We are upgrading DRI to Buy from Hold. Shares declined following a strong earningsreport last Friday, which we believe was driven by the concurrent announcement of CEO Gene Lee's retirement at the end of May. While we were not surprised by the initial weakness, we are confident investors will quickly realize his successor, Rick Cardenas, can continue to guide the company on a similar strategic growth path. We believe Mr. Cardenas' views as CFO/COO have greatly influenced Darden's direction in recent years. As our recent earnings note highlighted, Darden continues to report solid results, and we believe the company is well-positioned to outperform peers in a challenging operating environment. We acknowledge variant-related sales disruptions are a near-term risk, but we argue shares trading at ~17x our FY23 earnings estimate represents an attractive entry point for a high-quality company. ","Darden's scale advantages becoming more apparent. We believe Darden's significant scale advantages in marketing, data analytics/technology, and supply chain management combined with the rest of the full-service category still struggling, bode well for accelerating its share gains. The combination of pandemic-induced lockdowns, labor challenges, and supply chain disruptions to the commodity markets has taken an enormous toll on regional full-service chains and independent operators. In contrast, Darden has actually strengthened its operations during the past 18 months by making structural changes, such as simplifying its menu and operational processes and reducing its reliance on discounted promotional offerings. This has resulted in significant margin expansion relative to pre-COVID levels. With inflation now a key pressure point across the industry, Darden can further leverage its scale from this position of strength to widen its competitive moat. The company has routinely priced below inflation for years, so its brands should have ample runway to take further pricing, if needed, and still maintain a compelling value gap to competitors as most of the industry is aggressively raising menu prices to combat wage and commodity inflation. COVID-related sales disruptions remain the primary near-term risk. While we acknowledge Darden could experience near-term sales disruptions related to the recent rise in case counts, we believe the company has proven its ability to pivot quickly should the need arise. We also anticipate most investors will look through any disruptions, particularly given recent data points on the effectiveness of vaccine boosters and therapeutics against the Omicron variant. We are maintaining our target price and estimates. Our FY22/FY23 earnings estimates of $7.58 and $8.50, respectively, are unchanged. Our $165 target price implies shares trade around 12x EV/EBITDA NTM (18-19x P/E NTM) one year from now versus ~11x currently, and roughly in line with its 5-year average. Relative to the slower projected earnings growth of the S&P 500 (earnings +9.5% 2-yr CAGR), DRI (+11%) is trading at 83% of the index's P/E multiple with a 3.1% dividend yield (S&P 1.3%).",Chris O'Cull,"Chris O'Cull;Alec Estrada, CFA;Patrick Johnson",165,,Buy,Hold,USD,7.58,,8.5,,,,9.68B,9.69B,10.30B,10.30B,,STIFEL_DRI_CoNote_2021-12-21.pdf,DRI_CoNote_2021-12-21,,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=3e648869-825b-4cbf-8d8e-bb0e0235cc20&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
DTIL US,DTIL,Dec 12 2021 05:25PM,"Precision Biosciences, Inc.",Biotechnology,"PBCAR0191 Not Competitive With Yescarta, But We Think Stealth Cell Will Improve Persistence; Data Mid-2022 ","We remain Buy-rated following the company’s CAR-T update at ASH 2021; on paper, wethink the stealth cell technology looks well suited to improve cell persistence, something that we believe has been a major challenge for the allogeneic CAR-T category. The first- generation CD19-targeting CAR-T, PBCAR0191, showed interesting signs of activity in the post- autologous CAR-T setting, but it’s clear to us that the product profile isn’t likely strong enough to displace Yescarta. With peak expansion seemingly great, as it has been for other allogeneic CAR-T programs, we’re of the belief that cell persistence is therefore key to unlocking more efficacy, and thus we resonate with efforts to mitigate allorejection by not only T cells, but also NK cells. If this is successful, we think DTIL’s stealth cell CD19 CAR-T, PBCAR19B, will exhibit superior cell persistence which could be evident as early as mid-2022 when we get an initial look at this program. ","Of all the CAR T pursuits, we’re most excited about stealth cell as a means to improve cell persistence. We're operating under the assumption that if allogeneic CAR T can come close to replicating the cell expansion/persistence kinetics of autologous approaches, then it ought to be able to confer a similar level of efficacy. Relative to autologous, it seems that achieving better peak expansion is certainly doable with allogeneic CAR T; our understanding of the initial hypothesis was that better expansion could drive deep responses within a shorter window of time, ideally within the timeframe of allorejection. And in support of this, autologous CAR results show nice trends with higher peak expansion that correlate with clinical response. However, although the allo CAR T CR rates are impressive, they don’t seem as durable as auto CAR T. And notably, the auto CAR T data also convey that the area-under-the-curve is important and likewise correlates with achieving a clinical response. Lastly, it took ~3 months for most of the CRs (i.e. 80%) achieved with Yescarta to become evident, giving us the sense that persistence does matter. Consolidation dosing (i.e. administering 2 doses within a single lymphodepletion window) may help, but we still think these will still be gated by allorejection and therefore suffer from poor persistence. We’re encouraged by DTIL’s strategy of building in additional features within their allo CAR T products to avoid allorejection with the goal of greater persistence from a single administration of drug product. The stealth cell technology incorporates a short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) designed to knock down beta-2-microglobulin (b2m) such that MHC type | expression is greatly reduced, with the desired effect of mitigating allorejection by T cells. This is similar to CRSP’s strategy, except that since DTIL isn’t completely editing out b2m (where we'd expect b2m expression to drop to zero), they anticipate that each cell will maintain some low level of MHC | expression. DTIL hypothesizes that maintaining low levels of MHC | expression could be enough to mitigate allorejection by NK cells, which inherently have the capacity to recognize and reject cells that are completely devoid of MHC I. Additionally, they are also adding in the expression of an HLA-E receptor with an overlapping goal of mitigating allorejection by NK cells. Together, we think this will improve cell persistence relative to PBCARO191, and look to initial data in mid-2022 as offering the first glimpse of this mechanism. The PBCAR0191 update showed very good peak expansion, in our view, but clinica;durability doesn't look competitive with Yescarta. Enhanced lymphodepletion (eLD;demonstrated better peak expansion by an order of magnitude relative to the standar;lymphodepletion (sLD); despite this, durability is still below the bar set by Yescarta with ;6-month CR rate coming in at ~18% (vs. Yescarta's ~34% on an ITT basis).

EAT US,EAT,Dec 08 2021 07:52PM,"Brinker International, Inc.",Restaurants & Franchised Businesses,EAT: Will Cost Pressures Take a Big Mouth Bite Out of Earnings? ,"Our View: In light of the labor environment, we are revisiting our cost projections for Brinker.Fortunately, mobile location data indicates Chili's visitations have remained stable, so our comp projection for 2Q remains unchanged. However, higher costs projections caused us to lower our EPS estimate for F2Q to $0.40 and our FY22 to the low-end of the $3.50-$3.80 guided range (Street $3.63). The company has increased menu prices and plans to do so again in early F3Q, so we expect margin performance to improve sequentially from a low in F2Q. The company's greatest challenge is employee recruiting and retention, which has led to higher wage and training costs, and inefficiencies (e.g., food waste). Progress is being made, but it will take a few quarters to benefit margin. Although we remain Hold rated, we could see shares trading higher in the near term with margin performance likely bottoming in F2Q. ","The visitation trend at Chili's has remained relatively steady. Our review of mobile location data suggests visitation at Chili's has at least held steady relative to the exit rate in F1Q compared to 2019 levels, leaving us comfortable with our F2Q projection of 13% (Street 13%). We would also note visitation at Maggiano's has begun to show sequential improvement in recent weeks and, while still early, might be a preliminary marker of a stronger banquet season than some may be expecting. We raised our F2Q SRS projection for Maggiano's to 87% (Street 81%), implying sales are roughly 1% below 2019 levels. Labor is the biggest challenge. While the company has communicated that hourly turnover recently peaked, staffing remains a challenge for the company, and we expect it will show up indirectly in several areas of the business. For example, new heart-of-the-house employees will be less productive and make mistakes resulting in higher food waste (cost of sales). Understaffed restaurants also make it challenging to use promotions to drive sales, which is probably why we have not seen many offers from IJW during football season. The company has made strides improving recruiting, training, and retention, including 1) implementing a new phone application system that takes 45 seconds for an applicant to complete, 2) utilizing a virtual learning system managed at the home office to train new employees, and 3) removing some responsibilities from managers to allow them to focus on recruiting and retention. We expect mid-to-high single-digit (HSD in F2Q) wage inflation for the remainder of the year, particularly as the competition for talent intensifies among the many concepts struggling to reach optimal staffing levels. Commodity prices may be topping out but inflation to persist. After a sharp rise in prices over the past few months, it appears chicken and beef prices are at least beginning to stabilize, with spot pricing on a range of items even moderating slightly relative to August/September peaks. However, we still expect significant inflation through at least F3Q; we are modeling 6-8% in F2Q, HSD in F3Q, and MSD inflation in F4Q. We are less confident in our F4Q inflation assumption because the company will be renegotiating its chicken contract in the spring, which could have a meaningful impact on EAT's commodity inflation; chicken represents 17-19% of the basket, similar to beef. Menu pricing should help improve margin performance. Chili's has taken less pricing than most casual dining chains, but we expect it will catch up over the next few months. In mid- November, Chili's raised its 3 for $10 offer to $10.99, which we estimate is about a 1.5% price increase, implying F2Q pricing will approximate just over 2% compared to 0.6% during F1Q. We expect the company will take additional pricing in January, resulting in a 3.5-4.0% average increase for F3Q.",Chris O'Cull,"Chris O'Cull;Alec Estrada, CFA;Patrick Johnson",42,46,Hold,-,USD,3.5,3.7,4.25,4.3,,,3.85B,3.83B,3.94B,3.90B,,STIFEL_EAT_CoNote_2021-12-08.pdf,EAT_CoNote_2021-12-08,,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=34277ef5-17eb-41fe-887d-c97844a75431&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

ENTG US,ENTG,Dec 01 2021 02:46PM,"Entegris, Inc.",Semiconductor Capital Equipment,Stronger Semi Outlook + Non-Semis Growth (Life Sciences) = Higher Revenues and EBITDA Outlook; Target Price to $180 ,"On Wednesday, Entegris hosted a virtual Analyst Day and as we previewed (see our note,Entegris: Analyst Day Preview: Expect New Model to Support Larger Semi Opportunity (While Life Sciences May Be Next ""Big Thing""), Nov. 29), the company delivered a positive and an updated outlook on its core semiconductor opportunities, and raised its forecast both in the near term (2022) and over the long term. Entegris is well positioned to benefit from secular trends in the semiconductor market, and its relationships and collaborative efforts are deepening. Moreover, there are emerging market opportunities, like life sciences that can supplement its overall growth. This is driving a higher and more extended target model that reflects both strong top line and EBITDA/earnings growth. In turn, we are increasing our estimates, multiple, and target price. Our target price increases to $180 (from $151), which reflects 9.0x EV/sales our new FY23 EPS estimate. ","In its core semiconductor business, some of the key industry dynamics remain in place but 1) the market opportunity is tracking higher-than-expected and 2) Entegris’ outlook of outperforming these industry metrics are also tracking higher than previous expectations. From a market perspective, management believes semi growth is still likely to track at 2.0x GDP growth (although GDP growth is likely to be higher near term than in previous forecasts). On an organic basis, in terms of its semiconductor-related business, management now believes it can outgrow semi industry growth rates by +3-5% (up from its previous forecast of +3-4%). Supplementing this growth is 1) M&A opportunities which can add +1-3% and 2) emerging non-semi growth markets, which could add another +1-2%. These variables provide management with the confidence that it forecasted its revenue CAGR from 2021-2024E to be approximately 15% when all is said and done. Given the market opportunities and the continued critical nature of Entegris’ solutions, we would not be surprised if Entegris eventually exceeds this CAGR outlook. We believe there are key technology inflections in both foundry/logic (such as gate-all-around, high aspect ratio, etc.) and memory (such as 3D NAND layer counts, new materials, higher purity control needs). We have previously cited our view that materials engineering is becoming more critical to next- generation semiconductor manufacturing, while contamination control is also increasing from an intensity level given the miniaturization of devices and need to keep contaminants from lowering manufacturers’ yields. These aspects are key secular drivers for Entegris’ long-term outperformance outlook that we strongly support. Interms of its non-semis growth opportunities, management provided some additional color on the potential growth in its life sciences business. We have noted the recent strength in this business, driven primarily by the adoption of its Aramus storage product, targeting COVID- related vaccines. This success was driven by leveraging existing technology and investing in this opportunity early on. In fact, management is projecting this business to grow to $100 million in 2022 (off a $50+ million base in 2021) and for life sciences to be approximately $300 million in revenue by 2030. Overall, we believe management is disciplined and measured in its approaches to new market opportunities. We are very confident that this team will not haphazardly “chase trends” and will invest prudently. We believe life sciences on its own can add more than the +1-2% of incremental growth to Entegris when all is said and done.",Patrick J. Ho,"Patrick J.

EQR US,EQR,Dec 07 2021 12:30AM,Equity Residential,Multifamily REITs,Initiating Coverage With A Hold Rating ,We are initiating coverage of Equity Residential with a Hold rating. EQR has a high-qualityportfolio located in the coastal urban markets and is a prolific capital recycler with a strong balance sheet. Our target price of $93 equates to a 4.0% implied cap rate on 2023 NOI. ,"What Is EQR? Equity Residential’s geographic exposure reflects the company’s focus of creating communities in dynamic markets supported by knowledge-driven markets. Markets such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington D.C., and Seattle are emblematic of the thriving knowledge-based economies from which EQR derives its renter base. Expansion Markets. The company has recently re-entered markets such as Dallas/Ft. Worth, Austin, Denver, and Atlanta, which management believes have the potential for favorable Multifamily dynamics moving forward. These expansion markets are ones in which EQR hopes to build a presence, especially with the recently announced Toll Brothers JV. Given the extent of affluent renter migration to these cities, management believes it will be able to utilize its competitive advantages given the size of its portfolio. Toll Brothers JV Provides Development Runway. In August, EQR announced a strategic partnership with Toll Brothers’ Apartment Living division to develop new Multifamily assets. The company expects the JV to develop ~$600-$700 million per year in the above-mentioned expansion markets, and in select suburbs of traditional EQR markets. EQR will invest ~75% of the equity for each project with the option to acquire each property upon stabilization. Assuming 60% leverage, the companies expect to fund ~$1.9 billion of investment. Prolific Capital Recycler. The company has been active on the capital recycling front over its history. To this point, since 2015, the company sold $11.6 billion of assets for an unlevered IRR of 11.2%. This year alone, the company has sold ~$1 billion in assets, with $889 million of the assets in California. Acquisitions this year have also been ~$1 billion. EQR has been able to cycle out of older properties at impressive cap rates into much newer properties with improving fundamentals in EQR’s expansion markets. Introducing Estimates, Strong Growth CAGR. We are introducing our 2021, 2022, and 2023 FFO estimates of $2.97, $3.37, and $3.74. Our 2021 normalized FFO estimate of $2.97 sits at the high end of the company’s revised guidance of $2.95-$2.97 per share and is in line with consensus. Of note, we are above with the street in terms of 2022 and 2023 FFO estimates and believe numbers are likely to move higher over the coming months. When looking at future growth, over the next two years our estimates show EQR’s normalized FFO growing at an 12.2% CAGR from 2021-2023 compared to the sector average 2-year CAGR of 11.0%. Additionally, on a same-store NOI basis, we estimate growth of 10.1% in 2022 and 8.5% in 2023, very strong growth in our view. We believe the company’s above-average growth profile on both an FFO and SSNOI basis could drive share price outperformance. Above-Average Dividend Yield. EQR provides investors with an above average dividend yield of 2.8%, compared to the group average of 2.5%. The company consistently grows the dividend, a 6.7% CAGR from 2010-2020, and averaged a 3.0% dividend yield during this time.",Simon Yarmak,"Simon Yarmak, CFA;Connor Shockley, CFA",93,,Hold,Suspended,USD,,,,,,,,,,,,STIFEL_EQR_CoNote_2021-12-07.pdf,EQR_CoNote_2021-12-07,,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=7383789e-e943-4dd3-86e9-a0e4298c0efd&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
ESS US,ESS,Dec 07 2021 12:31AM,"Essex Property Trust, Inc.",Multifamily REITs,Initiating Coverage of Essex Property Trust With A Buy Rating ,"We are initiating coverage of Essex Property Trust, Inc. with a Buy rating. Essex has a highquality portfolio located on the West Coast. Our target price of $390 equates to a 3.6% implied cap rate on 2023 NOI. ","What Is ESS? Essex Property Trust is an internally managed, investment grade real estate investment trust focused on the ownership, management, acquisition, development, and redevelopment of apartment communities located on the West Coast of the United States. The company currently transacts in eight coastal markets in California and Washington State. ESS was founded by George M. Marcus in 1971 and completed its IPO on June 13, 1994. In April 2014, the company completed its $16 billion merger with BRE Properties, and was subsequently added to the S&P 500. As of September 30, 2021, ESS owned interests in 247 apartment communities comprised of ~60k apartment homes. West Coast Play. Essex owns a geographically concentrated portfolio of multifamily properties focused in Washington and California. These markets show strong economic growth with minimal supply pressure. The company believes these market characteristics, in addition to the increased propensity to rent in these markets due to home prices, will drive strong demand for their communities. To that point, as of 3Q21, the company’s largest sub- markets based on NOI contribution are Santa Clara (19%), West LA (15%), Oakland (14%), and Orange County (11%). Tech Recovery. Given the company’s exposure to the West Coast, and specifically technology heavy markets, we believe the recovery in tech hiring will support rents and occupancy. To this point, job openings at the top 10 tech companies in CA and WA are 44% higher than pre-pandemic levels. This, coupled with the fact that ESS’s markets have only recovered 63% of jobs lost during the pandemic, provides a clear path to recovery in these markets, in our view. Introducing Estimates, Strong Growth CAGR. We are introducing our 2021, 2022, and 2023 FFO estimates of $12.52, $14.18, and $15.59. Our 2021 normalized FFO estimate of $12.52 sits above the high end of the company’s revised guidance of $12.39-$12.49 per share. Of note, we are above the Street in terms of 2022 and 2023 FFO estimates and believe numbers are likely to move higher over the coming months. When looking at future growth, over the next two years our estimates show ESS’s normalized FFO growing at an 11.6% CAGR from 2021-2023 compared to the sector average 2-year CAGR of 11.0%. Additionally, on a same-store basis, we estimate growth of 11.2% in 2022 and 10.7% in 2023, very strong growth in our view. We believe the company’s above average growth profile on both an FFO and SSNOI basis could drive share price outperformance. Dividend.

EW US,EW,Dec 08 2021 10:13PM,Edwards Lifesciences Corp.,Medical Technology & Supplies,2021 Analyst Day Underscores Key Pipeline Opportunities Driving Top-Tier Growth Outlook for 2022 and Beyond ,"Offering a compelling near and longer-term growth outlook underpinned by their innovativestructural-heart-focused pipeline, Edwards’ annual Analyst Day takeaways seem clear: the company is effectively positioned to drive above-average/double-digit underlying top-line growth for the foreseeable future. EW both reaffirmed 2021 full-year P&L guidance while also extending its forecast horizon to 2028, underscoring management’s longer-term bullishness + optimism. The company also set the stage for healthy 2022 growth, offering up low-double-digit top-line sales growth guidance supported by a 12-15% TAVR revenue growth guide range. Edwards emphasized multiple highly-dynamic long-term growth opportunities including: (1) the still underpenetrated worldwide low-surgical-risk and asymptomatic TAVR patient populations, with Early TAVR initiatives enhancing the later-term growth-outlook; (2) the 2028 $5 billion estimated market opportunity for the underserved mitral and tricuspid valve repair-and-replacement patient groups (<2% treated), all particularly visible in 2022 when multiple-positive catalysts such as data readouts and product launches are set to occur... ","...(3) “smart” digital expansion opportunities throughout Critical Care, driving new patient care penetration opportunities throughout the decade; (4) leveraging the Surgical Structural Heart’s portfolio of differentiated mechanical and tissue valve offerings in emerging markets. Bottom line: With multiple large underpenetrated markets and compelling emerging market opportunities likely to drive robust top and bottom-line growth for the foreseeable future, EW remains a core Medtech holding. We rate Edwards Buy; TP $132. 2022 Guidance Encouraging as Top-Line Growth Projected to be “low double digit”. Shown in Exhibit 1, Edwards’ first-time 2022 sales ($5.5B - $6.0B) and EPS ($2.50 - $2.65) guidance were basically in line with Stifel/Street consensus projections ahead of the Analyst Day. We view the initial 2022 guide positively as the still low-double-digit growth sales growth outlook accounts for some Covid impacts throughout the year, although less than in 2021. Given that sales guidance's top end also accounts for some negative incremental Covid pressures, there could be room for upside if the pandemic wanes more than the guide anticipates. Outlined in Exhibit 5, historic Analyst Day revenue sales and EPS guidance ranges have all been in- line with or above the range initially provided, ex the Covid-impacted 2020. On EPS specifically, the range’s midpoint implies 13% EPS growth over our 2021 $2.27 per share estimate. Also worth noting, EW indicated that they have not yet seen any Covid-Omicron variant impacts and maintained previous 2021 guidance as the year comes to an end. In Exhibit 2, we highlight 2022 guidance assumptions for each EW franchise. Relative to Consensus/Stifel estimates, the 2022 franchise outlooks were mostly in line with previous projections, though our initial TMTT projections ($121M) were softer than guidance ($140M - $170M). Asked about the strong TMTT guide, company management indicated notable room for upside for EU Pascal sales versus 2021 as Covid driven softness wanes. In turn, we moved our 2022 numbers up to $151 from $121. As a whole, we raised our sales and EPS estimates for all of 22, 23, 24, and 25, given the company's positive commentary regarding the eventual rollout and expansion of TMTT products, and increased TAVR penetration in low risk and asymptomatic patients.

FATE US,FATE,Dec 14 2021 03:54AM,"Fate Therapeutics, Inc.",Biotechnology,"ASH Update - Positively Surprised By FT596 Low Dose Durability, Not Enough Data To Change The Model, But Bodes Well For DL4 ","We're reiterating our Buy-rated following ASH updates on FT516 (hnCD16) and FT596 (CD19CAR NK dose levels 1-3); the FT596 durability data aren't thesis changing, but on the margin are better than we were expecting. We think the durability data presented for FT596 lower dose levels are hard to interpret given the short follow-up time accrued thus far, but encouragingly there are a lot of ongoing responses rendering it possible that these data will mature favorably. Remarkably, all the aggressive lymphoma patients who achieved a response seem to have maintained that response, with 2 CRs persisting beyond 6-months. With a larger dataset, the PK data more clearly show cell expansion which doesn't look to wane with a second dose. Regarding FT516, we're also encouraged that this is showing activity in the post-CAR-T setting. We look forward to new FT596 data describing the profile of dose level 4 (900mm cells). ","The durability of FT596 at low doses is better than what we were expecting; although follow- up times are generally too short to make a high conviction call on the 6-month CR rate, we're highly encouraged that all the aggressive lymphoma patients who achieved a response are ongoing. Just focusing on the 8 aggressive lymphoma patients in the combination cohort B, we count 4 CR ongoing, with 2 beyond the 6-month time point. The sample size is very small, but this implies a 6-month CR rate in the neighborhood of 25% (2/8), with the potential for this to increase. The monotherapy cohort is harder to interpret but looks worse, as only two patients had aggressive histologies, both deceased. We think these data bode well for higher doses. It's still early to make a call on the impact that a second dose of FT596 has on the response rate and durability, but we're not that encouraged by the initial results; however, we think one confounding variable is that the second dose was done on a case-by-case basis which likely means that the time between doses was variable. Of the 13 patients who achieved a response after a single dose of FT596, 11 (7 CRs and 4 PRs) proceeded to a second treatment (cycle 2) with single dose of FT596. No patients experienced a change in their original clinical assessment. Thus far, 6 patients maintained their CRs at the point of assessment on day 29 of cycle 2 (C2D29), while 1 patient with a PR still showed PR but with a 30% greater reduction in the tumor size on C2D29. There are still 4 additional patients outstanding (1 CR and 3 PRs) who don't yet have C2D29 assessments as of the data cutoff on 10/11/2021. In terms of safety, there were no events of any grade of ICANS though there was a grade 1 CRS event in cycle 2 that didn't occur in cycle 1. We think the new PK data presented are interesting, and convey a more clear picture of expansion relative to data that were reported previously (08/19/2021), from what we can tell, the difference is being driven by 3 patients. Our first major takeaway from the PK data is that FT596 expansion is comparable between treatment cycles 1 and 2. We had speculated that the second dose might have a shorter tail as a result of more acute rejection upon patient immune recovery due to immunological memory, but this doesn't seem to be the case (though cells are at very low levels by day 28 in both cases). Second, there's more evidence of peak expansion, though we speculate that the 3 additional patients in this cohort (relative to the August update) are positively skewing the data, particularly at the day 8 time point. Specifically, peak expansion, as measured by copies of the hnCD16 transgene, reached 200-400 copies/ug (a 10-27x increase from baseline) on day 8.

We will be looking at either a stock pull back or signs that our estimates might be too low to get more constructive on the shares. We are raising our target price to $468, which reflects roughly a 3-turn P/E premium to the Info Services CY22 P/E average, reflecting organic revenue growth in the high-single digits (which is above typical growth rates for Info Services stocks) and an expanding operating margin. Incremental Call Items Include: Company is looking towards constant Adjusted Operating Margin expansion — this is a change from the historic targeted range of roughly 33%. The new CFO commented that they could look at something in the order of 50bps a year, though there wasn’t a commitment to that amount. The fact that the company is looking towards moving up the operating margin is a change from what we have seen from FDS over the last 12 years. The Restructuring Charge of $9M was an effort to get ahead of some of the expense items in terms of looking to improve the operating margin. These expense buckets are broadly 1) compensation, 2) real estate, 3) technology, and 4) third-party data costs. The restructuring involved expanding the span of control for managers and reducing management layers by one — commentary was that the company took 5% out of the compensation line. The company also took a $4M real estate charge in the quarter to exit some NYC real estate as the firm moves more towards a hybrid work environment model. Offsetting some of the cost savings is an increase to the bonus and retention pools, and 1Q22 bonus plan had $21M of costs versus $15M in F1Q21. Part of the cost savings will be reinvested into product development and key talent retention, though the company is not experiencing increased employee churn from the recent restructuring. Revenue and ASV growth was broad based. Management characterized the growth as a bunch of “singles and doubles’ rather than home runs. In terms of areas of success, within the front office offerings FDS is doing well with its trading capabilities and within the quant research environment, and the Fixed Income trading capabilities release should provide for good upside for the future.

FDX US,FDX,Dec 16 2021 10:08PM,FedEx Corporation,Global Parcel & Logistics,Christmas Comes Early for FedEx; Delivers 13% EPS Beat in F2Q22 ,"In our last report (Over the Hump Now, Time to Buy - Favorable Setup Does Not Warrant TroughValuation), we posited that a strong yield environment, significant ecommerce growth, and a coagulating European market position were powerful opportunities for a stock that got pummeled after significant (but fixable) labor headwinds. We also suggested that a near-term catalyst likely wouldn't come until F2Q22 earnings...and here we are. FedEx reported adjusted EPS of $4.83, surpassing our estimate by 9% and the Street by 13%. Broadly, yields were even stronger than anticipated, driving top line outperformance across all divisions. Labor costs and availability are still a drag, especially in Ground, but are on pace for recovery by 2H22, which should culminate in double-digit segment margins in the back half. And with increased guidance and a new ASR, we think there's a lot to like at current levels; reiterate Buy. ","Express (49% of revenue; 56% of EBIT)—Once again, yields drove the party bus, in our view, with beats across all product lines, culminating in a composite rev/package growth of 20%y/y vs. our 5% estimate. In F2H22, yield comps tighten, which we had been accounting for in our model, but management believes that higher capture from GRls, residual upside from renewals, and deepening penetration of SMB business should continue to support traction. Structurally, the market remains constrained, with strong demand: management sees U.S. Domestic Parcel Market growth of 70% from 2020-2026 (90% from e-commerce). That's plenty, in our view, to support a rational field of competitors—even if some get much bigger. Despite the cost challenges from labor and inflation, top line performance was sufficient to push margins ahead of our 8% forecast by about 20bp. Internationally, air cargo capacity should remain constrained through 2022, with no full recovery until 2024. And European cross- border ground remains a tantalizing opportunity for express growth and margin improvement as the TNT physical network integration wraps up early next year, in our view. Ground (35% of revenue; 26% of EBIT)—is still lagging as a result of labor disruption, which management puts into two buckets, each having an approximately equal impact. First is higher rates—higher wages, higher premiums for team members, and higher purchased transportation. Second is network inefficiency caused by labor shortages, which management described as additional linehaul costs, higher use of third party transportation, and asset repositioning, among others. Of these two buckets, we expect more of the first category to stick around, while the second category can be addressed with higher compensation, benefits, non-traditional perks, and better tools and flexibility to give workers more scheduling options. Cost headwinds shrank sequentially from about $400mm to approximately $285mm, and the company expects more to subside by the back half of the fiscal year, which will return the division to double-digit margins (see Exhibit 1). Apart from the operational challenges, Ground yields remain robust, and grew 9% y/y, which was 100bp better than we expected, whereas volumes grew 4% vs. our anticipated 1%, mostly as result of better-than-expected Home Delivery growth. Investment Conclusions: We think the outlook is good for FedEx (and the parcel industry). On the domestic front, demand remains strong, fueled by structural ecommerce growth amidst limited capacity. As such, the pricing environment should hold strong, even as comparables tighten, in our view. Internationally, we think air cargo capacity constraints will be with us for some time. And intra-Europe road services should provide good upside to growth. At ~11x 2022 EPS, we find valuation to be highly compelling (see Exhibit 2), especially on a relative basis. We don't believe the current environment and prevailing headwinds warrant this type of discount, and we believe there is still plenty of earnings power upside over the next couple of years. We are increasing estimates from $19.84 and $22.60 to $20.88 and $23.00 for FY2022 and FY2023, respectively. We see a compelling large cap value opportunity here.",J. Bruce Chan,J.

FLOW US,FLOW,Dec 13 2021 10:37AM,"SPX FLOW, Inc.",Flow Control,FLOW: Sells The Business To Lone Star Funds For $86.50 Per Share ,We move our rating to Hold and lower our target price to $86.50 on FLOW shares after thecompany announced this morning it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell the business to Lone Star Funds. Given the ~4.5 month process undertaken by the Board we are not expecting a higher counter offer to emerge. ,"The $86.50 take-out price is meaningfully below our prior one-year target price of $108: Our one-year target price assumed the company reached its 2023 15% operating margin target a year early and significantly outperformed that target in 2023. A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush. The sale of the business removes any market risk, of which there has been significant over the last 2 years, and execution risk of achieving the targets set. Investors can trade the potential upside scenario for the certainty scenario with this transaction. The transaction represents nearly 40% upside from the pre-Ingersoll Rand offer news in July. Shareholder returns have been very strong under the current management team led by CEO Marc Michael: On January 1, 2016, when Mr. Michael took over as CEO FLOW share price was $27.91 and shortly thereafter dropped to $15.76 on fears the company would trip debt covenants. The $86.50 sale price represents 210% appreciation vs. 130% for the S&P 500, strong outperformance. We believe the business is on strong footing with the transformation to an operating company, disposition of low-quality assets, and early stages of 80-20 implementation to drive margins over the next few years.

FORM US,FORM,Dec 08 2021 11:59PM,"FormFactor, Inc.",Semiconductor Capital Equipment,Primed for a good year (with Moore to come) ,"Against the backdrop of the SEMICON West industry tradeshow, we caught up this week withFormFactor management. We continue to view FormFactor as a major beneficiary of leading semiconductor IDM/foundry investment and adoption of advanced packaging. We have little doubt that wafer testing will take on more importance as more chip designs adopt system-in- package integration schemes over single die system-on-chip integration. Intel is leading this charge and in a presentation earlier today emphasized that it views advanced wafer sort/test as one of the keys to advancing heterogeneous integration. This bodes well for FormFactor heading into 2022 and we see the company possessing the organic drivers to comfortably achieve its 2023 target financial model, with ample financial flexibility to augment/accelerate this path were the right opportunity to come along. We reiterate our Buy rating. ","New capacity is on the way... One of the over-arching themes of SEMICON West is that significant investment across the industry is called for, to not only build some cushion into existing tight supply chains, but scale the broader ecosystem for impending growth in the years/decade ahead. In this context, it is apropos that FormFactor is on the eve of formally opening its new manufacturing facility in Livermore, which we believe is on track to ship first revenue this quarter. Recall that the seeds for this expansion pre-dates the pandemic, and moving forward should enable the company to increment up its output in a more sustainable, and ultimately cost-effective way. ...and will likely be needed. From a top-down perspective, the step-function increase in wafer fab equipment (WFE) investment this year and expected high sustained level of investment next year will support growth in leading edge semiconductor wafer starts — typically a good thing in terms of FormFactor’s core wafer test probe card business (assuming that end demand remains strong). On a more granular level, FormFactor is also coming off a transition year of sorts with revenue to Intel tracking down double-digits in 2021. We expect a bounce-back year in 2022, with Intel’s actions (and words) indicating that they are poised to make a run at re-establishing the company’s manufacturing and technology prowess. Whether Intel fully achieves its goals or not, we believe the proliferation of new chip designs leveraging Intel’s system-in-package architectures has the potential to drive revenue contribution back to (if not beyond) prior peak levels over the next 1-2 years, while also helping usher in a new era for packaging and test. While further expansion into new adjacencies still a focus. We remain bullish on the probe card market and FormFactor’s positioning, and over time management has broadened its addressable market to include complementary probe and metrology systems, with systems in total representing 17% of YTD sales. Addressing existing served markets, we believe the company’s $850M revenue target by 2023 is well within reach (sub-6% implied revenue cagr), and yet given the company’s strong acquisition track record, consumable- like revenue resiliency, and ample financial flexibility, we believe there continues to be good optionality here to accelerate/augment the mid-term targets through further M&A, which remains a core tenet of management's long-term growth strategy.",Brian Chin,"Brian Chin, CFA;Patrick J.

FULC US,FULC,Dec 01 2021 04:08PM,"Fulcrum Therapeutics, Inc.",Biotechnology,Continuing Weakness May Present Attractive Risk/Reward Heading Into YE21 Data Catalyst ,"Despite the initial investor excitement following interim Ph.1a FTX-6058 results (LINK), FULChas given up much of its gains with the current market cap lower than where it was post-data (Aug 10). Investors point to several questions/uncertainties on FTX-6058, which likely requires longer term data in patients (expected 2Q22). Although we previously viewed the next Ph.1a update by YE21 as largely incremental, we think FULC's weakness reflects investor caution/ negativity that may imply a more favorable risk/reward at the next update. In fact, whereas similar questions/uncertainties may linger even after the YE21 update, higher dose cohorts (20 and 30 mg) continuing to demonstrate favorable safety and efficacy, thereby providing optionality for FULC going forward, could reintroduce some positive sentiment into the stock. And with the caveat of different biological targets, relevant comps provide reasons to remain optimistic on FTX-6058 ahead of patient data next year. Reiterate Buy and $45 TP. ","Up/down of +60%/(-10%) may be possible by YE21 update. Since approaching ~$1.2B market cap, we believe the recent selloff is overdone. Consequently, what we previously perceived as an incremental Ph.1a update by YE21 may now hold greater stock implications with our bull/base/bear case scenarios implying up/down of +60%/(-10%). To be clear, many of today's investor controversies are less likely to be fully resolved by YE21; however, with relevant comps (discussed herein) and results that may suggest greater optionality for FULC going forward, we think a reinfusion of positive sentiment may be possible. Specifics of our scenarios touching upon HBG mRNA, F-reticulocytes, and safety profile are discussed within. Upside potential may be capped by uncertainties and controversies. Our conversations suggest at least 3 uncertainties resonating with investors today: 1) translatability of HBG mRNA and F-reticulocyte induction in healthy volunteers (HVs) to fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients, 2) dose-dependent safety signals, and 3) duration-dependent safety signals. We think these, among others, may have materialized as FULC's recent weakness. Whereas YE21 update is unlikely to provide an unequivocal resolution, a positive outcome (i.e., bull and base cases) may nevertheless provide some reassurance on FTX-6058 going forward. Since the SCD patient data are the key de-risking catalyst, even a bull case by YE21 may help FULC pare back some of its losses but re-testing/surpassing of the recent highs may be more tied to the data in 2Q22. In that regard, FULC has guided toward initiating Ph.1b study by YE21. Not expected by YE21: recently amended SCD patient cohort. Prior to 2Q22 catalyst, we think recently amended SCD cohort in Ph.1a may provide important early signal(s) in a patient setting. Naturally, we suspect investor interest on these data are also high. Per our conversations, however, Ph.1a SCD cohort data will not be presented by YE21 nor ahead of Ph.1b data in 2Q22.",Dae Gon Ha,"Dae Gon Ha, PhD;Jacques Villefranc, PhD",45,,Buy,-,USD,2.1,,,,,,16,,,,,STIFEL_FULC_CoNote_2021-12-01.pdf,FULC_CoNote_2021-12-01,,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=64c57aa1-a9e2-407e-992b-516d1631533d&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
GAMB US,GAMB,Dec 14 2021 10:50AM,Gambling.com Group Limited,Gaming & Leisure,"GAMB Announces First Deal Post-IPO, Acquiring Longstanding Fantasy News Supplier ","Yesterday after the close, GAMB announced an agreement to acquire Roto Sports, the operatorof fantasy sports advice site 'RotoWire'. GAMB will pay $27.5M in aggregate (~4x 2021E net revenue), $7.5M of which is to be deferred over a 2-year period post-close (but not subject to any financial performance requirements). GAMB expects to fund the transaction with cash on hand and equity. The deal is expected to close early 1/2022. We outline our thoughts on the announcement below. ","Our take: We are not surprised to see a positive reaction in the shares to yesterday's news, as we believe many investors were looking for management to execute on their first acquisition post-IPO given the accretive roll-up opportunity frequently highlighted. Recall a key tenet of GAMB's planned growth algorithm centers on accretive acquisitions of under-monetized sub- scale affiliates (or tangential content sites), supplementing an already considerable 30%+ organic revenue growth trajectory. In this case, we highlight RotoWire benefits from strong SEO capabilities already (e.g. ranking #1 on Google for ""daily fantasy advice"" and #6 for ""fantasy advice""), which can be easily leveraged for the more lucrative sports betting affiliate vertical where RotoWire has de minimus legacy exposure. Management also highlighted an attractive opportunity to yield up RotoWire's existing subscription model (via improved conversion and pricing). While slightly outside of GAMB's core affiliate model, the addition of subscription helps diversify GAMB's earnings with a more stable and predictable revenue stream. Even before factoring likely more meaningful topline synergies as compared to a typical performance affiliate transaction, we argue GAMB paid an attractive price for these assets with the ~4x 2021E net revenue multiple coming in at the midpoint of global historical affiliate transactions, and towards the low end of precedent transactions for U.S. facing sites (see exhibit 1). All-told, we are positive on the announced transaction, as we believe it checks all the boxes targeted in an acquisition at a seemingly discounted purchase multiple. GAMB has come in materially over the past month (-33% vs. S&P -1%), as shares have been caught up in the broader market-wide risk-off sentiment. While the appetite to take on risk into year-end is unclear, we believe our thesis remains intact. Namely, we see continued expansionary tailwinds in Q4 and into 2022 (CT, FL, NY, LA, MD, Ontario, Netherlands), no signs of customer acquisition spend slowing in North America despite select B2C consolidation, and likely ample accretive M&A opportunities as evidenced by yesterday's announcement - all against the backdrop of a business model that is already profitable and FCF positive. Hence, we reiterate our Buy rating. Model updates: We update our model to reflect the announced transaction, partially offset by more tempered organic 1H:2022 assumptions (largely timing and seasonality). Our 2022/23E net revenues go to $65M/$85M from $61M/$80M. Our 2022/23E Adj. EBITDA goes to $25M/ $38M from $26M/$35M. We note our 1H:2022E margin assumptions reflect slight dilution from the acquired assets (which currently run at ~20% margins), with margins ramping back to GAMB's 40% target by year-end as management yields up the acquired assets. Our $16 target price is unchanged, as higher estimates are offset by a slightly lower target multiple (to reflect macro related risks to the broader online group).",Jeffrey A. Stantial,"Jeffrey A.

GBT US,GBT,Dec 05 2021 06:59PM,"Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc.",Biotechnology,‘601 ASH Preview — We Think Hb Occupancy Goals Are Achievable; Strong Takes On Total Hb Likely Challenged By Small Dataset ,"We're reiterating out Buy-rating after previewing upcoming GBT021601 ('601) multi-dosedata at ASH, where despite small patient numbers (n=6) we expect '601 to show an improved profile relative to Oxbryta. The '601 single-dose hemoglobin (Hb) occupancy data in healthy volunteers already looks comparatively better than Oxbryta, but we think investors want to see even higher levels achieved (30%+) at relatively lower doses. Based on how Hb occupancy increased with Oxbryta when moving to a chronic dosing format, we likewise expect improved results with '601 multi-dosing, and our analysis implies 30% occupancy should be achievable at doses of approx. 1/3 Oxbryta (i.e. ~500mg), if not lower. With only 6 patients of data, we're expecting signs of good activity/trends, though we also assume the data will be noisy (as this was the case for Oxbryta). We think good occupancy, without added tox, could see the stock into the mid-to-upper $30's. ","We have strong conviction that '601 will generate superior Hb occupancy relative to what was achieved with single doses in healthy volunteers; 30-50% seems attainable. The bull case for '601 is that this will prove to be more potent than Oxbryta at much lower doses. Single doses of '601 certainly look superior to Oxbryta, but at lower doses Hb occupancy is still well below management's stated goal of 30+%. However, we believe chronic dosing will show substantially improved levels of Hb occupancy as this increased by ~2.7-fold with Oxbryta relative to single doses. Assuming the same magnitude increase, we think '601 can reach 30%+ occupancy at a ~third of the approved Oxbryta dose. Furthermore, this is likely an underestimate as '601 has a much longer half-life than Oxbryta, and we therefore expect greater drug accumulation in the blood. We expect hemoglobin occupancy of 40-50% to correspond to a total Hb increase of ~1.8-2.3 g/dL, though we also expect some variability that might render the interpretation of a small 6-patient dataset challenging. We caught up with GBT management who noted that while '601 and Oxbryta exhibit different capabilities in terms of Hb occupancy, once a certain level of occupancy is achieved, they are likely to induce similar increases in total Hb. We therefore think it's appropriate to look at what was achieved with Oxbryta to inform our view of the relationship between occupancy and total Hb increase. Using the trend established for Oxbryta in the phase 3 HOPE study, we've estimated a linear relationship between Hb occupancy and total Hb increase; we estimate a Hb occupancy of ~40-50% would equate to an increase of ~2 g/dL Hb, on average. One caveat that we think is important to consider, there was substantial patient-to-patient variability with Oxbryta in terms of Hb occupancy and total Hb increase. We assume ‘601 will be similar. The average Hb occupancy was clearly higher at the high Oxbryta dose of 1500mg versus the 900 mg dose, but there was substantial overlap between the two, with the range being in the ballpark of roughly +/-13% for both doses. Our base case is that variance will be similar with '601, and so we expect the 6-patient update at ASH to define biomarker trends, but fall short of fostering definitive conclusions. We think a larger study with higher power will be needed to ultimately prove out the Hb occupancy and increase achievable with '601. ",Benjamin J. Burnett,"Benjamin J.

GBT US,GBT,Dec 14 2021 02:30AM,"Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc.",Biotechnology,"ASH Update - '601 Hb Data Look Great, Though VOCs Likely To Be Debated (Inflammation? Bad Drug?) ","We're maintaining our Buy rating on shares following GBT021601 data at ASH; we think‘601 could potentially be a best-in-class oral and expect that to become evident with more data in 2H22. Although we were wrong to be positive on Oxbryta in 2021, we think '601 has a path to being a competitive asset in the oral SCD category, and that larger studies will more clearly convey this with data coming, we think, in 2H22 (we also expect pediatrics to benefit Oxbryta numbers in 2H22). We expect bears will point to VOCs as indicative of '601 not working, and that bulls will explain away these cases as a result of inflammation that didn't have time to resolve in the short phase-1 study. We lean with the bulls, but recognize more risk, and are therefore lowering our '601 POS to 50%, which lowers our TP to $68/share. ","We expect the debate going forward to center around VOCs, and the likelihood that these events were either caused by the drug, or indicative of an ineffective mechanism. We think the initial market reaction (which was negative) was the result of 3 cases of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC). At a high level, this challenges the bull thesis that greater Hb increases will confer better disease control. Had these not occurred, we think the stock reaction would have been wholly positive, but rather these events challenge the validity of the mechanism, and possibly also rekindle a long-standing debate around the potential for increases in hemoglobin to actually increase the risk of VOCs. Regarding the latter, Oxbryta operates via the same mechanism, and we don’t see any evidence of an increased risk of VOC. Oxbryta is likely a much less potent drug, but even still, there were some patients who achieved very high Hb occupancy, and total Hb increases. Recall that 20% of Oxbryta patients achieved absolute Hb increases of >3g/dL in the HOPE study after 72-weeks of treatment, and there’s a favorable trend on the reduction of VOC frequency with drug. Furthermore, VOCs were less frequent among patients with higher Hb levels, whether achieved through drug or because of inherently higher baseline levels. Finally, we think the efficacy of BLUE’s LentiGlobin in terms of VOC is supportive of mechanisms that increase total Hb. The bull case: VOCs may simply be the result of the very short treatment duration and incomplete resolution of inflammation, not an ineffective mechanism. A more benign explanation is that inflammation plays a role in VOCs, and this wasn’t resolvable in the timeframe of the study. Management made the case that when drug binds to Hb, the immediate effect is an impact on the deformability of red blood cells (RBCs). That addresses the RBC element, but we also think inflammation in the vasculature plays a role in VOCs. As we understand it, Adakveo’s target, P-selectin, facilitates the adhesion of both leukocytes and RBCs to blood vessels. We therefore think Adakveo's success in reducing VOCs is supportive of inflammation playing a role here. But it’s unclear if normalizing RBC health will have an immediate effect on inflammation, especially when that inflammation has likely existed chronically. Interestingly, gene/cell therapy has an immediate impact on VOCs, but these drugs require preconditioning chemo, which is, in and of itself, anti-inflammatory. We suspect that the immediate VOC benefit of cell therapy is possibly the result of preconditioning, while the longer-term effects are likely the result of increased Hb (which takes time to achieve). The timeframe for Hb to increase to peak levels from cell therapy is on the order of a ~3 months, and this seems sufficient to eradicate VOCs (and thus we suspect that inflammation is gone by this point). The ‘601 study was shorter, 8 weeks, and that may be too short to fully resolve inflammation and to see the benefit of increased Hb. Within we discuss our take (we side with the bulls, but recognize more risk as a result of the VOCs), the biomarker data, and our updated model.",Benjamin J. Burnett,"Benjamin J.

GBT US,GBT,Dec 17 2021 03:34PM,"Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc.",Biotechnology,"As Expected, Oxbryta Approved For Children And Receives CHMP Positive Opinion ","We think the approval of Oxbryta for children 4-11 in the US, along with the CHMP'spositive opinion rendering EU approval in adults likely, were each expected and bode well for peak sales. We assume both opportunities will benefit the model starting in ~2H22. We think each opportunity can be meaningful: we assume children will be more compliant on average while in Europe, we believe the volume of SCD patients is similar to the US. For the stock, the debate around if and when these opportunities impact revenue is likely to be overshadowed by '601, and the potential for this asset to differentiate in the oral category (we're encouraged by the hemoglobin increase data seen in the first handful of patients, 1.1-3.1 g/dL). Controversies around VOC events will require additional data to resolve, though before that, we think competitor data from FULC in 2Q22 have the potential to influence shares. ","Accelerated approval for Oxbryta in the pediatric population (children ages 4-11) is a nice positive. We think the label expansion will bring a meaningful number of new scripts that could also be accompanied by a better adherence rate under the thesis that parental support will drive better compliance. Based on our discussions with management, we understand that formulary access achieved for adults doesn't translate to pediatrics, and that management will therefore have to negotiate this separately. For adults, that process took roughly ~9 months, and management speculates that it could be quicker with pediatrics given payer familiarity with the drug. We therefore anticipate material sales from children not until 2H22. GBT is conducting post-approval confirmatory study, HOPE-KIDS 2, a transcranial Doppler flow velocity study that will explore the ability for Oxbryta to decrease stroke risk in children 2-14 years old. Separately, the positive CHMP opinion bodes well for Oxbryta approval in the EU; a decision by the European Commission is expected in 1Q22. We expect for the EU pricing to be at a discount of the US (we ascribe a 40% discount in our model); however, we still anticipate the EU to meaningfully contribute to peak sales. We model first EU sales in 3Q22, and estimate gross non-risk adjusted revenue of $4mm, $68mm and $120mm in 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively, and EU peak sales to reach $274mm in 2027. We think that if '601 is approved and shows a positive benefit on VOCs, this could add another $150mm in peak sales in the EU. We model the same average bottle/patient, gross-to-net, refill rate, compliance and new script headwind for the EU as we do for the US.",Benjamin J. Burnett,"Benjamin J.

GEVO US,GEVO,Dec 06 2021 10:51PM,"Gevo, Inc.",Energy and Power - Biofuels,Takeaways from our Gevo marketing event ,"Last week, we hosted Dr. Patrick Gruber (CEO), Heather Manuel (VP-IR & Communications),and John Richardson (IR Manager) for two days of investor meetings. The reception was positive as management highlighted its progress on developing Net Zero 1 and ambition beyond the first plant. We believe Gevo has a clear first mover and proprietary advantage in the use of carbohydrates to produce drop-in fuels based on its ~600 patents, recent press releases (ADM, Axens, Chevron, Sweetwater), and contract development pipeline (+1 bgpy). As investors become more familiar with these advantages, we sense discussions are shifting to focus on Gevo’s financial path to achieve its billion-gallon initiative, and expect management to provide a clear plan to achieve this in early 2022. Lastly, we are increasingly confident in management's ability to extract value for its Net Zero business through Verity and increase the value of its dairy RNG business through expansion opportunities. ","Gevo’s Net Zero 1 project is advancing as expected. Management reiterated the timeline for its general milestones and its support for Kiewet Corporation (top five contractors in the U.S.). The company expects to start ordering long lead-time equipment in 1H22 and reaffirmed its cost projections remain on track despite inflation pressures. Gevo's one billion gallon initiative and associated financing plan could re-rate the stock. We expect management to outline a clear enterprise financial plan to achieve one billion gallons of SAF production in early 2022, which we believe could meaningfully re-rate the stock. We estimate the company would only require ~$1 billion of equity capital between now and 2025 for the first six Net Zero plants and one ETJ plant and could self-finance the remaining eight using cash flow from operations, assuming an optimal project financing capital structure of 65% debt. Verity Tracking can unlock incremental value through Cl reduction and potentially spin out. Verity Tracking (blockchain technology to track sustainability attributes) has the potential to deliver CARB verifiable proof of the low-Cl corn to be used at the Net Zero 1 plant, potentially lowering the Cl score from 40 to -5. We estimate it could increase the project-level NAV by ~58% and project realizations by ~$0.72/gal. Longer-term, the company plans to spin out Verity Tracking. The use of cellulosic sugars could be a potential game-changer in Gevo's ability to deliver the lowest carbon transportation fuels. Gevo plans to buy cellulosic sugars over the fence from a future Sweetwater facility adjacent to Gevo's isobutanol plant. We expect the 30,000 tons of sugar produced by Sweetwater could yield ~4.1 mmgpy of isobutanol at Gevo's plant, upgradable to ~3.3 mmgpy of renewable hydrocarbons. Assuming the conversion of 95% of the cellulose and hemicellulose, the project would require ~60,600 dry tons of wood annually. The resulting hydrocarbons would qualify for D3 RINs and lower the Cl score of the project. For sensitivity purposes, we estimate a Net Zero plant that uses ~20% cellulosic sugar would achieve a project-level NAV uplift of ~16% and improve project margins by $0.23/gal. Gevo's NW lowa dairy RNG project remains on track and could expand in the future. The NW lowa diary RNG project remains on track and is expected to start up in early 2022. Full distributions are likely by year-end 2022, depending on the LCFS pathway approval timeline. Management noted it could easily expand by 20% to 30% in its existing plant. Due to the mad dash to develop dRNG projects and developer missteps, Dr. Gruber believes the industry is setting up to be a consolidation play over the next few years and would like to be more active at that point in time.

GIL US,GIL,Dec 13 2021 02:05PM,Gildan Activewear,Sports and Lifestyle Brands,"Gildan to Acquire Largest 3P Yarn Spinning Supplier, Frontier Yarns ","Gildan announced the acquisition of Frontier Yarns for $168mn, representing further verticalintegration of Western Hemisphere yarn spinning. We see the acquisition as a financial win with strategic opportunity and expect the acquisition will be EBITDA/EPS accretive though likely margin dilutive in 2022. Gildan is 40% of Frontier's revenue and Frontier is 20% of Gildan's yarn supply. Key to long-term strategic value is driving sufficient volumes through incremental Central American textile facilities to utilize a larger portion of Frontier's capacity. ","What happened: Gildan acquired Phoenix Sandford, LLC, parent of Frontier Yarns, for $168mn, representing an additional step in vertical integration of yarn spinning. Gildan-owned yarn spinning facilities supported approximately 65% of the revenue base prior to the transaction. Of the 35% balance, Frontier Yarns represented approximately 20ppts. Gildan’s partnership with Frontier Yarns is long-standing and Gildan reportedly represented 40% of Frontier’s revenue base. Gildan’s outsized contribution to Frontier volumes made Gildan an advantaged buyer, and we believe the transaction occurred at a mid-single digit EV/EBITDA multiple suggesting immediate accretion. The release's details on financial specifics (revenue base, margins, accretion, etc.) were limited. Why it matters: All in, we see the acquisition of Frontier as a financial win with strategic opportunity. Acquiring the Frontier operations will be EBITDA/EPS accretive though likely margin dilutive in 2022, in our view, and the transaction can be funded with cash on hand without meaningful change to the net leverage ratio (YE21E net leverage 0.6X, transaction price less than 0.3X turn of EBITDA). Further, yarn spinning vertical integration is margin accretive for the 40% of Frontier revenue associated with Gildan via the consolidation of the Frontier margin on this portion of the business. The 60% of the Frontier revenue base to customers other than Gildan represents capacity to both 1) absorb a portion of Gildan's volumes outsourced to other third parties (currently 15% of Gildan's revenue, represents approximately 30% of Frontier's capacity), and 2) support growth of Gildan’s Central America capacity expansion. Acquiring Frontier secures capacity in a tight market to support growth objectives and could challenge some competitors. We expect the Frontier acquisition is EPS/EBITDA accretive but margin dilutive in 2022. Key to margin accretion is driving sufficient volumes through incremental Central American textile facilities to utilize a larger portion of Frontier's yarn-spinning capacity. We will update our model to reflect the acquisition with FY22 guidance and additional clarity around the financial contribution.

GIS US,GIS,Dec 21 2021 05:22PM,"General Mills, Inc.",Food,Solid Top-Line Momentum - Pricing/Mix Accelerating to Catch-up to Inflation ,"General Mills reported 2Q22 EPS of $0.99, down 6% versus the prior year, which was $0.05below our estimate and $0.06 below consensus. This quarter represented a rare earnings miss for General Mills driven by cost inflation rising at a faster rate than pricing/cost savings. The company raised its FY22 guidance and now expects 4% to 5% organic sales growth, operating profit to be down 1% to 4%, and EPS is expected to be down 2% to up 1%. While organic revenue guidance is moving up over 5 ppts. and reported sales are up roughly 3% from previous guidance, the profit guidance is up less than 1% reflecting the higher cost environment. Input cost inflation is now expected to be up 8%-9% and total costs are up over $500 million since the company initially provided guidance for the year. We continue with our Hold rating and our $64 target price. ","General Mills’ raised its FY22 guidance to reflect the strong start to the year on the top-line and the recent divestiture of the European Yogurt business. The company now expects organic sales growth in the range of 4% to 5% (up from -1% previously) suggesting similar rate of growth in the second half of the year in relation to the first half (+4%). We are raising our organic sales estimates for the year and now estimate 4.5% growth with a 7% price/mix benefit partially offset by a 2.5% volume decline. The company is pushing through pricing at an aggressive rate to offset the increasing rate of inflation — pricing was up 5% in the quarter (up 2% in 1Q22) and the company expects a stronger pricing contribution in the second half. Inflation though is on the rise and between double-digit input cost inflation now expected in the second half and higher supply chain costs including from labor and other disruptions, General Mills believes it can price (and cut costs) sufficiently to offset this inflation in the future. We now estimate FY22 EPS of $3.81, up $0.02 from our previous estimate driven by slightly higher earnings estimates across the second half. The company’s profit outlook now calls for operating profit to be down 1% to 4% (previously -2%), and EPS is expected to be down 2% to up 1% (versus flat previously). We now estimate 0.5% EPS growth for the year in line with the company’s guidance. The margin cadence should start to improve across the second half as pricing ramps up and the comparisons are easier. Our gross margin estimate includes a 240bps decline to 33.4% in the first half due to the lag in pricing to inflation and a 125bps expansion in the second half. We estimate operating profit will decline 1% in FY22 with the headwinds of inflation, supply chain costs, divestitures, volume deleverage, and continued reinvestment partially offset by HMM cost savings, SRM actions, and lower administrative costs, with the operating margin expected to decline 80bps to 16.7% by our estimate. We continue with our Hold rating for the shares and our $64 target price which suggests a 12.5x EBITDA multiple for the business standing at a comfortable 10%+ premium to its large-cap food peers. While the shares traded down today, we believe this reflects the short-term reaction to the softer second quarter while not taking into account the overall increase in guidance, including a significant increase in sales guidance.",Christopher R.

Following the strong start to the year, management slightly raised its ARR outlook for the full year and maintained its revenue targets, with margins coming down slightly from prior targets as a result of heightened investment in the cloud platform and go-to-market. We were encouraged by the strong start to the year and believe the company is beginning to hit its stride cloud migrations and net new cloud business, and will be monitoring the pace of the cloud transition going forward. We maintain our Hold rating and $125 target price on GWRE shares. ","Cloud transition strength offset by higher than expected cloud operating costs. Total revenue of $165.9mn ((2%) y/y) beat consensus of $164.8mn. Subscription and support revenue grew 36% y/y to $79.0mn. License revenue declined (38%) y/y to $40.2mn. Services revenue grew 1% y/y to $46.8mn. ARR was $594mn in F1Q22, up from $582mn at the end of F4Q21. Non-GAAP EPS of ($0.21) came in above consensus of ($0.23). Non-GAAP gross margin came in at 44.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at (17.3%). While FY21 margins decreased y/y, management notes that the decrease is mainly due to the company's investments in order to migrate existing customers to the cloud, in addition to lower employee attrition accompanying higher employee turnover costs, prompting downward assumption adjustments. CFFO decreased y/y to ($107.0)mn ((65%) margin) and FCF decreased y/y to ($114.2)mn ((69%) margin). The cloud transition continues: The company closed 5 cloud deals in the quarter, with an additional 6 cloud go-lives. Franklin Mutual, a Tier 1 insurer founded in 1879, migrated to the Guidewire Cloud platform utilizing the autopilot roadmap for strategy and noted the six-month update cycle.

HYFM US,HYFM,Dec 08 2021 07:08PM,Hydrofarm Holdings Group Inc.,Cannabis,Investor Meeting Takeaways ,"We offer our takeaways following investor meetings with Hydrofarm Chairman/CEO BillToler and CFO John Lindeman (primer here). The near term environment commanded outsized interest. Hydrofarm suggested trends are stable implying a LSD to MSD underlying 4Q21 revenue decline. Hydrofarm reiterated expectations for challenges lingering through 1H22 with a more normalized 2H22 supporting the company’s initial FY22 commentary suggesting 8% to 10% organic growth. While reiterating caution around maintaining the pro forma combined margin profile with MSD+ inflation in FY22, the company struck a confident tone around pricing while outlining productivity opportunities borne from the slowdown and robust M&A activity transforming the platform. Amid softer category conditions, limited visibility, and inefficient capital markets dynamics, the shares are down 49% in 2H22 (S&P 500 +9%) pushing the shares to a level we believe dramatically undervalues the long-term growth prospects. We continue with our Buy rating. ","Hydrofarm suggested trends are relatively stable, not deteriorating or improving, implying a LSD to MSD 4Q21 underlying revenue decline. We now estimate 4Q21 revenue of $114 million, adjusting our estimates slightly for FX with our estimates including a 4% organic revenue decline. While the U.S. states licensed market is one pocket of demand for the hydroponics category, we outline improving dried flower consumption trends through 4Q21 below suggesting evidence of category stability. We estimate FY22 revenue of $626 million predicated on 8% underlying revenue growth, at the low end of the company’s initial commentary (+8% to +10% organic revenue growth). Our outlook suggests a weaker 1H22 performance followed by 2H22 growth in-line with the company’s mid-teens revenue growth algorithm. We believe our outlook is appropriately cautious allowing the California issues to cycle and does not fully consider Hydrofarm’s market share opportunities or greater contributions from new markets. We continue to estimate FY22 EBITDA of $92 million, suggesting a 14.6% EBITDA margin. Hydrofarm reiterated caution with respect to the 14.7% to 15.8% EBITDA margin included in the 2021 pro forma outlook given onerous input cost inflation (MSD+ expectations) alongside softer volumes prevailing through 1H22. Hydrofarm struck a confident tone with respect to pricing outlining a rational environment. We believe there could be a formal productive program introduced in early 2022 as the company is evaluating opportunities created by slowing category growth amidst the extensive manufacturing network. During 2021, the company expanded its distribution capacity, and the greater financial flexibility has afforded heavy investment behind inventory ensuring continuity of supply. Hydrofarm completed five acquisitions during 2021 adding over $200 million of revenue and $60 million of EBITDA, by our estimate. Hydrofarm suggested activity is unlikely to repeat at such magnitude with the company targeting one to two acquisitions per year. We estimate the firepower to execute over $400 million of M&A, though we believe target demands are irrational in the context of the current environment impeding any near-term activity. We believe the recent underperformance has placed outsized focus with the underperformance furthered by inefficient sector dynamics. While there is limited appreciation for capitalizing on cannabis category growth, Hydrofarm is one of the few platforms boasting broad investability with the ability to profitably capitalize on cannabis category growth. Hydrofarm continues to enhance its leading category position. We believe renewed investor enthusiasm for our robust outlook and key points of differentiation for profitably capitalizing on category growth will drive outperformance for the shares.",W.

IDYA US,IDYA,Dec 07 2021 05:13PM,"IDEAYA Biosciences, Inc.",Biotechnology,Initial Darovasertib Combo Data in MUM Look Good; IDE397 Biomarker Data The Next Event ,"We find this morning's initial efficacy update for darovasertib (PKC inhibitor)+crizotinib (a dualALK and cMET inhibitor) in metastatic uveal melanoma (MUM) as highly positive and boding well for future updates; however, we view this program as more ancillary to the stock and remain Hold-rated based on skepticism around IDE397's clinical prospects. Initial Darovasertib combo data (n=16) look highly favorable relative to historical results for competing agents, and are notably above management's ORR goals. Heading into this event, we had already modeled a high probability-of-success (POS) of 80%, and feel that these data are supportive of that estimate. But, we also believe the commercial opportunity is relatively small limiting this program's impact on the stock. Management plans to provide a mPFS update and to meet with FDA regarding the registrational pathway in 1H22. The next event for the stock is likely to be IDE397 biomarker/safety data in 1H22. ","We came away impressed with the efficacy of darovasertib + crizotinib; we think there is a high likelihood of positive results in future updates. Specifically, 4/13 patients with >2 scans had confirmed partial responses (31% ORR, above management's goal of 20%) with 2 other patients experiencing >30% tumor reduction (1 unconfirmed PR) — implying a 38% unconfirmed ORR. We wouldn’t be surprised to see ORR improve in subsequent updates as 3 non-responders had achieved disease control at the first scan but had not undergone a second scan. Despite a small data set, the darovasertib combo looks favorable relative to other approaches (cabozantinib, selumetinib +decarbazine combo, tebentafusp) where historical ORR ranges from 0-5%. Looking forward, we expect that approval will ultimately hinge on long-term outcomes where historically the mPFS and mOS are approximately 3.3 months and 21.7 months, respectively. Based on today’s results, we think these are achievable, especially considering that all patients (n=16) with =>1 scan have experienced tumor shrinkage (100% DCR). Management commented that they’re happy with where they are in dose escalation, and while the tolerability profile of the combo isn’t pristine we think it’s acceptable; 27% of patients experienced G3, drug-related AEs (no G4 DRAEs observed) with 36% of patients experiencing a drug-related AE leading to dose interruption. No patients had gone off treatment prior to their second scan at the time of the datacut. Ideaya expects to receive FDA feedback on a potential registrational trial for the darovasertib +crizotinib combo and to provide additional clinical data in 1H22. Management noted that the darovasertib + crizotinib combination currently appears to offer their best chance to show clinical activity in MUM but that they still plan to evaluate darovasertib as monotherapy in the adjuvant setting. = The company plans to disclose additional data on daro+tcrizo (including a readout on median PFS) in 1H22, the same time frame in which it targets to get feedback from the FDA on a potential registrational trial. Regulatory guidance pending, Ideaya presented two potential scenarios for the registrational trial: 1) Enroll a completely new phase 2 trial involving 125-175 MUM patients randomized 2:1 darovasertib+crizotinib vs. darovasertib; or 2) Enroll 50-100 additional patients (for a total 75-125 patients) as part of a phase 2 expansion of the ongoing single-arm trial. Both scenarios would be followed by a phase 3 confirmatory study, randomized 2:1 daro+crizo vs. investigator's choice with PFS and OS as primary and secondary endpoints, respectively. These compare with the open- label, 2:1 randomized phase 3 study of tebentafusp completed prior to its regulatory filing in which Immunocore evaluated 252 patients treated with tebe and 126 patients treated with investigator's choice of checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, or chemotherapy dacarbazine (n=378).

IGT US,IGT,Dec 16 2021 04:05PM,International Game Technology PLC,Gaming & Leisure,"New Year, New Company, Old Multiple; Initiating Coverage with a Buy Rating and $43 Target Price ","We are initiating coverage of International Game Technology (IGT) with a Buy rating andestablishing a $43 target price. At its core, we view IGT as a lottery business, trading at a gaming multiple, with limited credit for an accelerating core growth algorithm and improved balance sheet. While skeptics would argue a conglomerate discount could persist in absence of corporate actions, we see ample catalysts to help close the gap to lottery peers. We also sense an under-appreciation for IGT’s high-growth Digital & Betting segment, which we argue is well-positioned given incumbency advantages, benefits to scale, and quality talent in-flows. Given the timing of capex cycles and cost saving initiatives, FCF should ramp considerably for the next four years yielding likely meaningful deleverage and return of capital. All-told, we see considerable upside embedded in the shares with our $43 target price implying 75% upside potential, and hence rate IGT Buy. ","Description: International Game Technology (IGT) is the world’s largest end-to-end gaming technology company. The Global Lottery division (74% of 2019A Adj. EBITDA) provides retail and digital products and services to U.S. and international lotteries, including management services, draw-based systems, instant ticket management and printing, commercial services, and related product sales and support services. The Global Gaming division (26% of Adj. EBITDA) engages in the sale and leasing of slot machines, casino management systems, and other related products. The recently bifurcated Digital & Betting segment provides iGaming and sports betting content and technology to B2C operators. The pro-forma company was formed in 2015, when lottery focused GTECH acquired gaming focused IGT with the combined entity assuming the IGT name. Investment Rationale: We recommend owning IGT shares based on the following factors: (1) IGT’s lottery business remains deeply discounted relative to public and M&A comps, with several catalysts to re-rate; (2) IGT looks well-positioned to compete across most high profile growth opportunities (Gaming, sports betting, iLottery, cashless), while current valuation portrays IGT as solely a low growth legacy provider; (3) expectations for IGT’s gaming business remain extremely muted, setting up likely upside bias to estimates even despite several years of share losses; and (4) FCF should be prolific for several years with IGT between capex cycles, driving significantly improved balance sheet and meaningful capital returns. Target Price Methodology: We derive our $43 target price via a SOTP methodology. We ascribe a 10.0x multiple to our 2023E Adj. EBITDA estimate for the Global Lottery segment, at the low end of peer and historical M&A comps to reflect a potentially sticky conglomerate discount relative to IGT’s pure-play peers. We value the Global Gaming business at 5.0x Adj. EBITDA, below the low end of 6-8x slot manufacturer historical multiples reflecting our conservatism around potentially further share losses. Lastly, we value the hyper growth Digital Betting segment at 10.0x Adj. EBITDA, below the low end of most B2B online gaming peer multiples reflecting our relatively conservative views on the online gaming trajectory coupled with meaningful outstanding macro risk. After discounting back one year and adjusting for minority interest, this brings us to our $43 target price. Risks: We believe investment risks include: (1) limited visibility into consumer normalization, (2) a protracted recovery in purchasing behavior, (3) IGT’s lawsuit seeking Wire Act clarification, (4) a relatively concentrated shareholder base, and (5) FX and regulatory risk from international exposure.",Jeffrey A.

IOVA US,IOVA,Dec 06 2021 11:49PM,"Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc.",Biotechnology,New Manufacturing Site Is Online And Ready For Commercial Scale; FDA Feedback On Potency Assays Imminent & Hard To Call ,"As part of an Investor event, we toured lovance’s new manufacturing facility (i(CTC) located inPhiladelphia and came away impressed; quick specs: size is ~136,000 sq-ft, annual capacity is 1000's patients/year. The new facility is currently being used to produce clinical trial material, though it's built to supply commercial product at a run rate of “thousands of patients” annually. At the investor event, management also talked about their launch plans, and noted that the mechanics of inpatient reimbursement have largely already been worked out (i.e., DRG-018), and that they plan to initially focus on treatment centers that have existing cell therapy/stem cell transplant capabilities. We didn’t catch wind of new details regarding their dialogue with the FDA on potency assays, and continue to feel as though we don't have an edge here (which forms the basis of our Hold-rating). We expect a more detailed disclosure about this by year-end/early-2022. ","iCTC manufacturing site visit: new construction adds capacity for 1000’s of TIL patients annually. As part of an investor event, we toured the recently constructed lovance Cell Therapy Center (iCTC) which is now online and will serve as the primary site of manufacturing of lifileucel commercial product, if approved. The site is designed to support TIL manufacturing (currently gen 2, though workflow is amenable to gen 3) for thousands of patients, with the first TIL sample having been produced in September. Technician training takes approximately 12 weeks, and at this point they have 20+ certified technicians. Central to the process, iCTC incorporates dedicated rooms for processing cells on a patient-by-patient basis; management explained that workup times are onthe ss order of hours and that several patient samples can therefore be processed per day in each suite. Lastly, we were also given a glimpse at some of the space/equipment dedicated to release assays, though understandably no new information was disclosed on the current potency assay situation. Management also talked about the potential launch of lifileucel and noted that reimbursement may be relatively straightforward thanks to the groundwork laid by autologous CAR T. CAR was initially reimbursed under an old DRG code that was buttressed by a new technology add-on payment. But eventually, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) created a new DRG code (018) that reimburses approximately ~$430k/patient, including add-on and outlier payments, and notably this includes non-CAR T therapies such as lifileucel (in fact, lifileucel is specifically named). They envision that this would be inclusive of any supportive agents, such as aldesleukin. Regarding volume, management pointed out that CAR T volumes are concentrated, with approximately 10 sites accounting for almost half of all utilization commercially, and they expect a similar dynamic to play out with TIL therapy. They plan to ramp up site onboarding when the BLA is submitted to minimize the amount of time between physician training and the commercial launch. The next event for the stock is likely to be an update regarding FDA feedback on potency assays. We believe best-case scenario would be the acceptance of cytokine-based assays as sufficient to quantify TIL potency along with no requirement for procuring additional data. If that happens, we’d expect a sharp rebound in shares. But we also think it's possible that a more bearish scenario could play out where additional/different assays would need to be developed, possibly requiring new clinical data. Management has long talked about having additional assays that they could leverage if need be, but understandably (given the competitive landscape) they've been close to the vest on specific details, making it hard for us to garner high conviction in a successful outcome near term.",Benjamin J.

","We walked away from today’s investor meetings incrementally positive on IQV’s long-term story, particularly on the competitive front. We don’t expect VEEV’s information services offerings to pose more of a competitive threat than existing niche data suppliers, and don’t expect other CROs to replicate the capabilities |QV has with regards to enhancing protocol design, improving site selection and patient enrollment, and Real World Evidence. The backdrop for the industry is positive and IQV’s position in the industry continues to be strong, which should enable it to continue to outgrow the industry despite its large size. While we had expected IQV to focus more on M&A in the next several years, based on conversations with management we think the weighting of the $2B-$3B of annual capital deployment will lean more heavily towards M&A versus share repurchases, and we are tweaking our model to reflect this expectation — our prior model expected about 51% of capital deployed towards M&A, and we are now modeling 71% deployed towards M&A. This has the effect of lowering our 2022 Adjusted EPS estimate from $10.26 to $10.21, and it modestly lowers the Adjusted EPS in subsequent years as well. That being said, the company has a strong track record of outperformance that we don’t expect to change. We are maintaining our $313 target price (valuations have increased even though we lowered our 2022 Adjusted EPS estimate by $0.05) and we continue to see a path for the shares towards the $360 level through a blended valuation of Information Services and CRO valuations. Key Points Include: Pharma environment is very healthy. Funding environment is very strong, new drug approvals were ahead of 2020 levels by 3Q21, and there aren’t any significant patent cliffs. IQV’s business would be tough to replicate. The company has extensive expertise in cleansing and interpreting the data with over 1B longitudinal patient lives, over 150K data suppliers, and over 1M fragmented data feeds, and it has data on a global basis. Company uses its TAS (legacy IMS Health) data assets in 80%-90% of CRO deals. Company doesn’t bump into VEEV on its Information Services deals much at all. |QV expects VEEV to become a niche provider of data, similar to what it competes with from other companies in the marketplace. Revenue growth accelerating from three factors. Large CROs taking market share from small ones, IQV taking market share from larger ones (leveraging the merger benefits), and IQV is capitalizing on the emerging biotech growth. Company to weight capital deployment more towards M&A over the next several years. These are likely to be faster growing businesses or capabilities in faster growing areas that would be accretive to 1|QV’s growth. Cash flow should continue to be strong.

IRM US,IRM,Dec 13 2021 10:13PM,Iron Mountain Incorporated,Business & Information Services,"IRM to Acquire ITRenew: Should Be Accretive to Revenue Growth, EBITDA, AFFO and Adjusted EPS ","Last Friday IRM announced its intention to purchase ITRenew for a minimum of $925M, orabout 12x TTM EBITDA. ITRenew competes in the IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) space that provides data center decommissioning and data erasure services. We expect this deal to be a financially attractive to revenue growth, EBITDA, and AFFO. We are increasing our target price to $49, which reflects 13.3x our 2022 AFFO estimate (including $0.08 ITRenew accretion), and 12.9x our 2023 AFFO estimate (including $0.11 of ITRenew accretion). ","Last Friday IRM announced its intention to acquire ITRenew for $725M in cash for 80% of the company’s shares, and the remaining 20% will be acquired within three years after close for a minimum enterprise value of $925M (subject to revenue-based earn-out targets that could result in several hundred million dollars more in purchase price). The implied TTM purchase multiple is 12x on minimum purchase price of $925M, though this price could go up if ITRenew succeeds and earns the earn-out (which would be a good outcome for IRM). The deal will be completed with cash via a newly raised debt and is expected to close in 1Q22. All employees in the company are expected to roll their equity interests into the deal (the private equity sponsor is monetizing) pursuant to the transaction. We expect this deal to be a financially attractive to revenue growth, EBITDA, and AFFO. Although it will weigh on IRM’s margins given it is a lower margin business (18%-19% vs. mid-30% for IRM), we are not overly concerned about the margins of the business. We view revenue and profit dollar growth as more beneficial to IRM than margin expansion, and would expect investors reward the company for prioritizing these items over pure margin expansion. Assuming ITRenew grows between 11% (overall market growth) and 16% (prior two-year CAGR for the company), we calculate the deal to be roughly $0.08 to $0.09 accretive to 2022 AFFO and EPS, with an additional accretion in subsequent years. We estimate the 2023 AFFO and EPS accretion to be $0.10-$0.12.These accretion ranges assume a starting revenue number of $415M (the reported TTM number) for ITRenew, depreciation of 3.5% of revenue, 5% interest rate on incremental interest expense, a 16.5% tax rate, and 291.5M shares outstanding (3Q21 actual), and an early 1Q22 deal close. We estimate leverage to initially increase to 5.9x EBITDA, declining to 5.4x by the end of 2022. We plan to layer the acquisition into our published estimates when the deal closes. We are increasing our target price to $49, which reflects 13.3x our 2022 AFFO estimate (including $0.08 ITRenew accretion), and 12.9x our 2023 AFFO estimate (including $0.11 of ITRenew accretion). ITRenew competes in the IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) space that provides data center decommissioning and data erasure services. We believe |TRenew is the largest provider in this highly fragmented space, with two other larger providers being Sims Lifecycle Services (based in Australia) and TES (based in Singapore). The company has grown at a 16% CAGR over the past two years — and this rate of growth is on an upward trajectory — against an end- market that is expected to grow at an 11% CAGR over the next five years. ITRenew is able to outgrow the market because it is positioned well within the hyperscale data center market, which is the fastest growing portion of the ITAD space. We understand Sims has some hyperscale business, but not to the degree of ITRenew, and other players are more point solution players that are not as prevalent in the hyperscale market.

JBL US,JBL,Dec 16 2021 06:33PM,"Jabil, Inc.",Technology Supply Chain,"JBL: Another Beat-Raise Despite Supply Issues; Reiterate Buy, Price Target to $75 ","Jabil's 1Q'F22 sales of $8.567bn, (+9.4% y/y) beat our estimate by $282mn, driven by strongdemand from several markets, including auto, mobility, semi-cap and cloud. That Jabil was able to deliver upside given the continued constrained supply environments speaks to its superior supply chain expertise and solid execution. That said, management expects supply issues (particularly for legacy semiconductors) to remain challenging, and factored that into guidance for the next couple quarters. Still, Jabil raised its FY22 revenue guide from $31.5bn to $31.8bn (+8.9% y/y) on expectations of improved supply in its second half, as well as strong demand signals from most end markets. It also guided FY22 EBIT margin of 4.5%, up 30bp y/y, despite what we believe is at least a 20bp headwind due to the supply and logistics issues. We reiterate our Buy rating and raise our price target to $75 from $68, or 11x forward earnings. ","Quarter Summary: Jabil reported 1Q’F22 revenue and adjusted EPS of $8.567bn (up 15.6% q/q, up 9.4% y/y) and $1.92 above our revenue and adj-EPS estimates of $8.29bn and $1.81 (Street was at $8.29bn and $1.80). Sales came in at the higher end of guidance ($8.0bn-$8.6bn) driven by broad-based strength in healthcare, industrial and semi-cap, and mobility.Gross margin of 7.9% was 40bps under our 8.3% estimate due primarily to mix, while adjusted operating margin of 4.7% was just below our 4.8% estimate. By segment, Diversified Manufacturing Services (DMS) (55% of sales) grew 20.1% q/q and 11.1% y/y on strength across healthcare, auto, and mobility. Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) (45% of sales) grew 10.6% q/q and grew 7.4% y/y on strength across digital print and retail, industrial and semi-cap, and 5G wireless and cloud. Jabil repurchased 2.1mn shares for $127mn during the quarter with ~$830mn left in its share repurchase authorization. 2Q’FY22 (Feb.) Outlook: Jabil guided 2Q’F22 revenue of $7.1bn-$7.7bn (up 8.4% y/y at midpoint) and adj-EPS of $1.35-$1.55, vs. our previous estimate of $7.43bn and $1.40. Jabil expects the DMS segment to grow 4% y/y to $3.8bn, and EMS to 14% y/y to $3.6bn. JBL also guided adj-operating income of $290mn-$350mn, net interest expense of $37mn, and adjusted tax rate of 24%. FY22 Outlook: Management guided FY22 revenue and adj. EPS of $31.8bn (up 8.9% y/ y) and $6.55 (versus prior guidance of $31.5bn and $6.35), Jabil expects EBIT margin to expand 30bps in FY22 to 4.5% despite continued supply constraints. Management sees supply constraints continuing through the spring into early summer but expects conditions to ease later in CY22. Jabil expects $700mn+ in adj. FCF in FY22.

KEX US,KEX,Dec 08 2021 08:43PM,Kirby Corporation,Maritime,The Corner Has Been Turned At Kirby And the River Ahead Should Be Smooth Sailing For Miles and Miles ,"We hosted meetings with the Kirby management team today, and we are more confident thanwhen we upgraded KEX shares to Buy in October (Hurricane Clean Up Taking Time, But Valuation Attractive: Upgrading To Buy) that cash flow and earnings should be accelerating quickly, and as that happens, we expect shares to reprice significantly higher. Barge spot rates are moving up quickly, utilization is currently at 90% and rising, annual contracts are being repriced at higher levels, the fracking equipment backlog has grown 400% in the last five months, and the list could continue. Yet, the share price has languished, and valuation is well below mid- cycle multiples. We expect as the quarterly results trend higher, so too will the share price, and if the company were to spin or sell the upstream component of the D&S business, there could be potential for a more meaningful step-change in valuation. ","Inland. Between the 35% of inland business that is spot, and the roughly 20% that has contracts set to be renewed before year-end, there is potential for a meaningful improvement in earnings contribution starting in 1Q22. Average spot rates sound to be about 20% higher than where they had bottomed, and 10% better than contract levels. However, there would need to be another ~25% more spot rate inflation to reach mid-cycle rates, which yield about 20% operating margins for KEX. As market utilization improves, spot rates should continue to rise. We estimate through the return of refinery capacity, barge demand should improve by 3-5% in the next 6-9 months. Furthermore, as new petchem infrastructure comes online, there could be another 2-3% boost to demand. Barge supply is set to shrink about 0.5% this year, and probably at least that much again next year as there are virtually no barges on order. For 4Q, utilization should be in the high 80% range, but is currently about 90%. Thus adding demand to falling supply, we expect utilization could reach the mid to high 90% range in 3Q22. Distribution & Services. Unsurprisingly the oil and gas portion focused on building and repairing fracking equipment is doing much better recently. Management indicated that the backlog has grown 400% in the past five months, off a very low base, but still considerably faster than we have been modeling. Given the company's dominant share in the E-frack market, if anything, we expect the pace of activity to accelerate. While improved contributions from this part of the business are nice and likely to only be getting better, ultimately, we still do not view it as a good fit relative to the maritime platform. We expect that should the business be sold or spun off, the remaining marine business would garner a much higher multiple, and the parts separately are more valuable than combined. With the recovery of the energy markets and less debt at Kirby, we believe there is potential for that separation to now be a next 12 months event (for more thoughts on a potential carve-out, see page 2). Should that happen, we expect shares could easily add $10/share with a positive announcement in this regard. It's all about the MoMo. Utilization and spot rates are rising on the inland business, market conditions appear to be bottoming in the coastal business and should strengthen as oil demand continues to inch higher, and the return of drilling should transform D&S profitability. We expect that momentum should take cash flows to mid-cycle levels by 2023, with contracts gradually repricing higher. Using historical mid-cycle margins on the current asset base, we expect that would translate into about $6/share of free cash flow, with 2024 likely even higher thanks to contract lag. As cash flow builds, each quarter is better than the last, and the company moves to beat and raise territory, we expect shares to re-rate higher. As an added bonus/catalyst, a carve-out/sale of the energy portion of D&S would likely drive multiple expansion, and a much more material degree of upside relative to our current $67 target.",Benjamin J.

(KMI) released its FY22 guidance and expects an Adjusted EBITDA of$7.2 billion or 5% increase over FY21 estimates, excluding the outperformance related to winter storm Uri. We have updated our estimates to better reflect management's expectations. At this time, we are maintaining our Hold rating and updating our TP to $20.00. ","FY22 Financial Outlook The company expects an EPS of $1.09 for FY22, up $0.33 from the current FY21 forecast. The increase is largely due to asset impairments taken in 2021. KMI projects a capital growth budget of $1.3 billion for expansion projects and contributions to joint ventures, and it expects to generate DCF in excess of discretionary capital expenditures and dividends of approx. $870 million. In addition, the company plans to return additional cash to shareholders in 2022 through modestly increased $1.11 annualized dividend per share, and opportunistic share repurchases of up to $750 million. The company now expects to end FY22 at a 4.3x leverage versus its long- term target of 4.5x.

KNX US,KNX,Dec 06 2021 01:22PM,Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc.,"Trucking, Logistics & Truck Leasing",Knight-Swift Continues Empire Expansion with LTL Acquisition; Reiterate Buy ,"Knight-Swift announced this morning it has acquired Midwest Motor Express (MME) for $150m.MME is expected to produce around $137m in revenue, $27m in adjusted EBITDA (19.7% margin) and $16m in operating income (88.3% OR) for FY21. This would result in a ~5.6x multiple on forward adjusted EBITDA or ~9.4x forward op. income - both seem to be favorable for KNX given the carrier's market positioning (26th largest domestic LTL carrier per Transport Topics), margin profile and where LTL comps trade. Knight expects its combined LTL business (AAA Cooper + MME) to move up to 13th largest LTL provider from 15th before the acquisition. We like the deal and see it as consistent with management's messaging that they want to build out a nationwide LTL network and continue to utilize their scale advantage across freight verticals. ","Quick Thoughts on the Deal: Knight acquired AAA Cooper earlier this year for ~9.6x 2021E EBITDA, which was considerably higher and closer to in line with the LTL comp range, at that time, than is the MME deal. For reference, large LTL providers SAIA and ODFL trade at roughly 18x and 25x 2021E EBITDA, respectively, based on FactSet consensus. Another comp, YELL (unionized, lower margins), trades at ~7.3x. It's hard, however, to directly compare MME to much larger, national players. After catching up with management, there appear to be a few items that contributed to the attractive relative valuation - (1) MME does not own most of its terminals. MME was previously acquired by an ownership group including PE firm Red Arts and the group carried out a sale- leaseback of most terminal assets, (2) there was likely limited interest from national players making the group of interested buyers somewhat smaller and (3) the real estate footprint is in a less-densely populated part of the country, though it does connect the dots well for KNX. Overall, we see the deal as favorable for Knight-Swift and expect there to be synergies over time. Updating Estimates, TP to $72: We update our model to incorporate the acquisition's expected ~6 cent accretion in 2022 and raise estimates slightly (not related to the deal) to account for better-than-expected market conditions for freight. We separate out ~10% of expected future revenues into TL and the remainder into LTL based on an approximation of MME's revenue split. We continue to view a 14.5x multiple on 2022E EPS as appropriate for KNX when accounting for the combination of mid-cycle dynamics and a shift toward businesses with higher barriers to entry.",Bert W.

KRT US,KRT,Dec 12 2021 11:49AM,"Karat Packaging, Inc.",Specialty Distribution,KRT: Texas Bus Tour: Rockwall Distribution and Manufacturing Site Tour - Demand is Outstripping Supply ,"We reiterate our Buy rating and $29 target price on Karat Packaging (KRT, Buy, $21.20). OnDay 3 of the Stifel Texas Industrial Bus Tour we visited the KRT Rockwall Distribution Center and met with CEO/Founder Alan Yu, COO Joanne Wang and Director of Sales Daniel Quire. Demand is outstripping supply but KRT continues to find new supply sources to at least outpace the competition on fulfillment. Production capacity is being expanded by 25% in plastics (cups and hinged containers) and 50% in paper products (cups and containers). All the production capacity can alternate between eco-friendly materials and conventional materials. There have been six price increases in FY21 to address raw material and freight costs with another coming at the start of FY22. Freight issues have not eased and the line of sight on any relief is out six months. ","Company message Supply chain is very tight around paper products. KRT seeks niches that have limited domestic supply chain support and develops its position as the secondary source to the customer. KRT has sought and developed alternative sourcing to at least outperform the competitor on fulfillment. Newmanufacturing capacity added in Rockwall expanding plastic products by 25% and paper products by 50%. Very strong demand from take-out, ghost kitchens and limited service restaurants. Eco-friendly push benefits KRT as it has invested in production to flex based on raw material demand. Our observations Port congestion is not getting better, leading to redirecting containers to alternative destinations - WA, TX and NJ away from CA. More price increases to come and customer is not balking. M&A remains an avenue of growth but likely slows until a permanent CFO is added. Sales growth still strongest in Online followed by Distribution. Retail is stable and National Accounts is impacted by tough Y/Y on supply chain constraints. Remains steadfastly focused on maximize gross and AEBITDA margin with strong cash conversion. KRT has become a market disrupter in food packaging production and distribution.",Michael E.

LESL US,LESL,Dec 10 2021 05:26AM,Leslie's Inc.,Consumer/Retail,That Went Swimmingly: 4Q21 Earnings Update ,"Following robust 4Q21 results, we continue with our Buy rating for the shares of Leslie’swhile increasing our target price to $29 per share. F4Q21 revenue and EBITDA were both ahead of our estimates, and the company initial FY22 guidance was robust, but likely conservative in the context of the business’ momentum: revenue +10% to +12% versus the long- term +MSD-+HSD outlook. The initial EBITDA growth outlook suggests a flat EBITDA margin performance, but likely affords significant flexibility for increased investment, cost pressures, and mix. Leslie’s announced a $300 million share repurchase authorization, and we outline significant flexibility to quickly execute this authorization. We expect the shares to trade higher on the robust results and initial FY22 outlook with sustained investor enthusiasm likely to build for the company’s ability to disproportionately benefit from the pool/spa category’s advantaged growth. ","Leslie’s reported F4Q21 revenue of $409 million, significantly outpacing our $388 million estimate, above the high end of the company’s outstanding guidance ($391 million). Revenue grew +7% with comparable sales +10%, (+16% excluding calendar changes), with reported results burdened by a 5% headwind from lapping the 53 week. Two year comparable sales grew 39.6% accelerating slightly from F3Q21 (+38.8%) despite a higher level of stock outs manifesting in a deceleration in trichlor sales. The gross margin grew 187 bps y/y while higher SG8A (+16.5% y/y) tempered EBITDA growth (+2.4%). We now estimate FY22 revenue of $1.5 billion (+12%), up from $1.42 billion, with our estimate at the high end of the company’s guidance range. We estimate comparable sales growth of +8% for the year, which includes 5% retail pricing; we include $30 million of M&A alongside 15 new stores (10 residential, 5 new pro locations) adding to the year-end base of 952 stores. We believe our outlook will prove conservative with our estimates including decelerating comparable sales growth through the year with upside potential from stronger market share gains, higher pricing, and increased M&A. We now estimate FY22 EBITDA of $305 million, up from $299 million, at the high end of guidance ($295 million-$305 million). Absolute EBITDA growth guidance matches long- term expectations, but we believe expectations for a muted gross margin (flat to +10 bps) performance provides significant flexibility to absorb mix headwinds and cost pressures. Leslie’s has successfully passed along pricing, and increasing private brands penetration should be an added tailwind for the gross margin. Leslie’s announced a $300 million share repurchase authorization. With $345 million of cash on hand, debt to EBITDA at 2.9x, and our outlook suggesting FY22 FCF of $177 million, the company has ample resources to pursue this accretive use of cash flow alongside organic and inorganic investment. We believe the company will be aggressive if the shares hold at current levels. We estimate FY22 EPS of $1.00 which includes just $100 million of share repurchase. We continue with our Buy rating, and we are increasing our target price to $29 per share, which we derive by assigning a 17.5x EV/FY23E EBITDA multiple. We believe Leslie’s underperformance year-to-date (LESL -24%, S&P 500 +24%) has been a function of new issuance trading dynamics and perpetual overhangs from secondary concerns. With the F4Q21 results and FY22 guidance robust while likely including a heavy degree of conversatism, we believe the focus will shift to the robust fundamental outlook and increasing position of strength for capitalizing on the advantaged pool/spa category driving outperformance for the shares.",W.

LFUS US,LFUS,Dec 02 2021 05:20PM,Littelfuse Inc.,Technology Supply Chain,LFUS: Raising Estimates to Reflect Carling Acquisition; PT to $290; Maintain Hold Rating ,"We are raising our forward estimates to reflect Littelfuse’s acquisition of Carling Technologies,Inc., which closed on Nov. 30, 2021. Carling, which has annualized sales of ~$170mn, is a supplier of switching, circuit protection and power-distribution technologies, with a focus on commercial transportation and communications infrastructure, two important markets for Littelfuse. We view the acquisition as highly complementary, with significant cross-selling opportunities and some cost synergies. ","Our modeling assumptions. Littelfuse said it paid $315mn in cash for Carling, which generates ~$170mn in annual sales. It plans to report Carling results within its automotive segment, even though some of Carling’s sales are in the telecom space. Littelfuse raised its 4Q'FY21 revenue and adj-EPS estimates by $15mn and $0.02, respectively, to account for one month of Carling contribution. Other than those figures, LFUS did not disclose other financial metrics, such as gross profit or EBITDA margins. However, we believe Carling margins are likely below LFUS’s automotive-segment margins (in the mid teens), as has been the case with other LFUS acquisition targets. The component supplier typically improves margins of companies via cost and sales synergies. We are modeling Carling EBIT margins initially in the high-single digits, with some improvement in the back half of 2022. Our new estimates: Our 4Q'FY21 sales and adj-EPS estimates go from $514.5mn and $2.89 to $529.5mn and $2.91. We raise our FY22 estimates from $2.162bn and $13.20 to $2.345bn and $13.62. Raising price target to $290 from $270, but maintaining Hold rating. Our new price target is based on ~21x our new FY22 adj-EPS estimate of $13.62. We are maintaining our Hold rating. We believe LFUS's Electronics segment is likely near the peak of the cycle, and given the company's high valuation relative to peers, we remain on the sidelines.",Matthew Sheerin,Matthew Sheerin;Kurt V.

LIVN US,LIVN,Dec 07 2021 07:54PM,LivaNova PLC,Medical Technology & Supplies,Upbeat Analyst Day Highlights Solid Base Business Growth Outlook and Compelling Pipeline Potential ,"Providing clear and positive perspectives on both the outlook for the company’s current “core”franchise and the company’s strategic pipeline, LivaNova’s Analyst Day offered investors an encouraging outlook from both a near and longer-term perspective. Management affirmed both guidance and positive takeaways including: (1) multiple above-market growth-driving initiatives, providing 5-8% 2021-2024 base-business sales growth rate outlook across the core business segments. These initiatives include ACS salesforce expansion, CEC-based epilepsy sales- team growth, and a 2022 next-generation Cardiopulmonary Heart-Lung-Machine launch; (2) continued strategic portfolio initiative (SPI) execution, utilizing LIVN’s VNS and HNS technology for the treatment of difficult-to-treat-depression, congestive-heart-failure, and obstructive-sleep- apnea. Together, all potentially driving 7-10% 2021-2024 sales growth; (3) driving margin expansion through leveraging internal efficiencies and cost reduction strategies, with 25-30% “core” and 17-22% core + SPI 2024 operating margin ranges targets. Reaffirming near-term guidance, management also indicated the Street's 2022 numbers (~$1.05B revenue) are “directionally heading the right way”. ","Encouraging Short Term and Long Term Guidance Commentary: Nearer-term, LivaNova management highlighted positively that run rate trends are progressing in line with expectations, suggesting to us that sales run rates have not yet been negatively impacted by the Covid Omicron variant. Longer-term and highlighted in Exhibit 1, the company outlined guidance from 2021 to 2024 for both the core business and core + SPI business. Guidance reflected core business sales growth at 5-8%, a low 70’s 2024 gross margin, and a 25-30% 2024 adjusted operating margin range. Guidance also incorporates $11M-$12M in annual interest expense, anda 15-20% tax rate. If SPls continue to progress at their current rates, management estimates the ""Core + SPI"" business to grow at 7-10% annual sales growth. Gross margin would land in the mid-70s given the higher margin product mix, but adjusted operating margins would still be lower than “core” at 17-22% due to R&D and salesforce spending ramp up. LIVN only provided diluted adjusted EPS guidance for Core + SPI, but expect ~20% yearly growth. Management Commentary Indicates Strategic Portfolio Initiatives are on Track. RECOVER Difficult to treat Depression Trial: While not adding anything new on RECOVER, LivaNova reiterated previous commentary surrounding the therapy’s value and approval timeline. With 250 unipolar patients enrolled, management expects 250 implantations will be completed in the first quarter of 2022, leading to a first look from the independent analysis group. Since so many patients were enrolled recently and have not had a significant amount of data integrated into the analysis, management downplayed the chances of the trial being stopped on its first look. Still, given the company's transition to registry timeline, it appears LivaNova expects the data readouts later this year and in early 2023 (each readout/look occur after 25 new patients are implanted) to likely yield more statistically notable positive results. The company anticipates transition to registry by late-2022/early-2023 and CMS reconsideration of non-coverage decision during 2024. Furthermore, they projected annual sales of $150-200M at 4 years following transition to registry dependent upon a favorable CMS non-coverage reconsideration decision.",Rick Wise,"Rick Wise, CFA;Anton Heldmann",98,,Buy,-,USD,2.64,,,,,,1.06B,,,,,STIFEL_LIVN_CoNote_2021-12-07.pdf,LIVN_CoNote_2021-12-07,,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=78ef8c88-9ee9-4863-a685-3ed8a7eae802&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
LNN US,LNN,Dec 14 2021 05:37PM,Lindsay Corporation,Water Technologies,LNN: F1Q22 Proprietary Irrigation Survey; Positive Market Fundamentals And Dry Conditions Bode Well For Spending ,"We recently completed a survey of 50 of Lindsay's domestic irrigation dealers. Our regressionmodel predicts F1Q22 domestic sales up 33.7% based on dealer responses (R-Square = 0.68). Dealer network sentiment was roughly in line with our prior survey with volume expected to increase 3.4% vs. 3.7% previously over the next 12 months. Dealers reported domestic volume up 2.4% with prices up 19.9% over the past three months (F1Q22). This compares to dealers' forecast three months ago for F1Q22 of +2.3% y/y. Dealers expect volume over the next three and 12 months to increase 2.7% y/y and 3.4% y/y, respectively, (dealers historically underestimate volume changes in both directions) and 100% of dealers continue to expect further price increases. We continue to view the 12-month outlook positively given the current demand environment and positive market fundamentals despite supply chain challenges and continued uncertainty around COVID-19 variants. ","Dealers this quarter continue to note that positive market fundamentals (positive net cash farm income and strong growth in crop cash receipts driven by high crop prices) along with drought-like winter weather conditions across the West, Northern Plains, and South are supporting a strong demand environment as growers are more willing to make investments and upgrades for the upcoming 2022 growing season. Dealers stated drought-like winter weather conditions have growers doing more work in the fields when compared to last year. Some dealers believe the higher level of work/activity currently could be positive for the upcoming spring selling season as growers look to invest to conserve water while maintaining crop yields in what these dealers believe will be a drought year. We note that the spring months are the primary portion of the irrigation selling season. When asked about price increases from Lindsay, dealers continue to express concern but remain confident of being able to pass through price, given favorable market dynamics. Dealers were more concerned about rising crop input prices (seed, fertilizer, pesticides, etc.), which resulted in additional uncertainty on the NTM outlook. Primary Takeaways From Our Dealer Survey: Price increases accelerated (again) in F1Q22 with dealers reporting 1,990bps vs. 1,830bps in the last survey. We note that all dealers in this quarter’s survey continue to expect further price increases from Lindsay. Steel prices remain elevated with North American Plate and hot-rolled coil steel (HRC) during F1Q22 up 17.2% y/y and up 0.4% q/q, respectively (Exhibit 7). We continue to expect that there will be some pressure on Lindsay’s margins over the next quarter+ as it continues to pass through pricing. We believe business conditions remain conducive for passing through pricing with crop prices offsetting the higher pivot cost. Dealers report last three months sales up 2.4% y/y. Our assumption is dealers are reporting unit volume sales (ex. price) and dealers have historically under-reported changes in volume in both directions. Based on these responses, volume and price, our predictive regression model estimates domestic sales will be up 33.7% vs. our model of up 25% organically. This model historically has an R-Square value of 0.68. Next three months volume is expected to be up 2.7% y/y. Next 12 months volume is expected to be up 3.4% y/y.",Nathan Jones,"Nathan Jones, CFA;Adam M.

LOVE US,LOVE,Dec 06 2021 05:51PM,The Lovesac Company,Internet,Lovesac F3Q:22 Preview ,"Lovesac will report F3Q earnings on December 8"" pre-market. We expect another strongquarter, against difficult compares, fueled by the continued strength in the housing market and growing awareness of the brand. Our F3Q revenue and adj. EBITDA estimates are generally in line with consensus expectations. We expect revenue of $112mm (+50% y/y growth) and adj. EBITDA of $(3.0)mm (-2.7% margin). We expect lower EBITDA margins in the quarter from (1) lower gross margin from higher inbound freight and (2) increased investment in infrastructure and hiring. Supply chain constraints, which continue to impact the sector, will likely be a key topic of discussion as we progress through the holiday season. We maintain our favorable view given the long-term opportunity for share gains and continued strength in the housing market. ","Strong top-line momentum. Lovesac guided F3Q sales growth to approximately +50% y/y. Our F3Q revenue estimate of $112.4mm (+50% y/y) is in line with consensus expectations of $112.2mm and versus 43.5% growth in the prior year. Last quarter revenue increased 65.4% against an easier 28.7% prior-year compare. Our showroom revenue estimate calls fora 61% y/y increase as we expect 131 showrooms (versus 107 in the prior year) while our estimate for eCommerce growth calls fora 30% y/y increase (versus 125% growth in the prior year). Revenue has topped estimates in each of the last six quarters at Lovesac and recent reports from peer furniture companies have pointed to persistently strong demand as the housing market remains robust. Williams-Sonoma raised its 2021 outlook reflecting stronger growth and La-Z-Boy noted demand continues to be strong across the enterprise with an all-time high backlog. Lower gross margin and higher investment spend to drive adj. EBITDA lower. Lovesac guided F3Q adj. EBITDA to a range of ($3.0)-($4.0)mm. Our ($3.0)mm estimate is in line with consensus. We expect gross margin down roughly 500bp y/y due to higher inbound freight costs. While we think the promotional backdrop remains benign, Lovesac is beginning to lap benefits seen in the F2H:21. Additionally, elevated levels of hiring and infrastructure expenses expected earlier in the year have now been pushed into 2H:22 and will work against margin in the quarter. We expect marketing expenses (as a percentage of revenue) will likely be higher in F3Q due to initiatives surrounding the new product, which will also weigh on adj. EBITDA. On the call. We expect supply chain disruption impacting the category to be a key focus on the call. Lovesac launched its new product The StealthTech Sound + Charge system in October. The company expects little contribution to total sales for the balance of the year, though prior guidance reflected the incremental marketing spend. We will be listening for any updates. Beyond the quarter: In our view, the backdrop for spending on housing remains strong and the opportunity for Lovesac remains attractive given its strong product, limited brand awareness and continued innovation. Our F4Q revenue estimate, which is slightly ahead of consensus, calls for 29% growth. The company noted Sactional inventory levels were in a good position ahead of the holidays, despite ongoing global supply chain headwinds. Given how long supply disruption trends into next year, there could be additional pressure on gross margin, relative to current estimates. Potential revenue upside from stronger housing tailwinds as discussed by competitors could be a potential offset.",Lamont Williams,"Lamont Williams, CFA;Scott W.

LOVE US,LOVE,Dec 08 2021 04:40PM,The Lovesac Company,Internet,"Strong Results Despite Supply Chain Headwinds; Buy, $105 PT ","Lovesac reported F3Q revenue growth of +56% y/y and adj. EBITDA of $5.8mm (5.0% margin),both well ahead of expectations. The company guided F4Q revenue growth to approximately +35% y/y, above prior consensus (+28%), and adj. EBITDA in the $12.0-$13.0mm range (below prior estimates). Lovesac meaningfully improved its inventory position despite industry-wide inbound freight headwinds, which are expected to intensify in F4Q and persist into FY:23, leaving it well-positioned ahead of the holiday season. Management did provide informal FY:23 guidance and expects top-line growth in the high 20% range (prior consensus +24%) with even faster adj. EBITDA growth. We are adjusting our gross margin and adj. EBITDA estimates to reflect management's commentary surrounding the inbound freight headwinds, but we maintain our Buy rating and $105 PT on LOVE shares as we see upside to risk / reward at current levels given the nascent current market share and growing brand awareness. ","F3Q results exceed expectations. Lovesac reported F3Q revenue of $117mm (+56% y/y), above our consensus-matching estimate of $112mm (+50%) and management's guidance for ~50% y/y. The robust top-line results come despite supply chain headwinds and a difficult compare (sales grew +44% y/y in F3Q:21). eCommerce sales returned to y/y growth following two consecutive quarters of declines against difficult compares when all showrooms were closed; internet sales grew +38% y/y in F3Q, ahead of our +30% y/y estimate (consensus +11%). eCommerce sales growth comes in tandem with continued strength in showroom sales, which grew +68% y/y, exceeding our +61% y/y estimate. Adj. EBITDA of $5.8mm (5.0% margin) was well ahead of our estimate of ($3.0)mm (-2.7% margin) and the company's guidance for ($3.0)- ($4.0)mm, Gross margins impacted -510bps y/y due to higher inbound freight costs. GM contracted -510bps y/y to 50.2%, in line with our 50.3% estimate, due to higher total distribution / tariff expenses (-748bps), partially offset by lower product costs stemming from vendor negotiations related to tariff mitigation and a more benign promotional environment (+238bps). The higher distribution / tariff expenses stem from an increase in inbound freight costs / tariffs due to elevated levels of product sourcing from China (-953bps), partially offset by improvements in warehousing leverage and outbound freight costs (+205bps). We expect higher inbound freight costs will likely work against gross margin through the balance of the year and into next year as the company sells-through inventory acquired during peak freight rates. Management will likely utilize the promotional lever to partially mitigate higher inbound freight rates, and margins could improve sequentially throughout FY:23 if the supply chain environment normalizes and production shifts away from China. Better insulated from near-term supply chain headwinds than peers. Lovesac and competing industry operators have been facing inflated inbound freight costs and delays due to global supply chain disruptions. The company noted container cost increased 85%; however, the Sactional's modular design allows it to optimize each container, likely better than peers. Additionally, the company operates with a diversified global production capacity and can direct more POs to the country (China, Vietnam, or Malaysia) with the greatest capacity to ensure shorter lead times and inventory availability, leaving it well-positioned for the holiday season. Further, the company's two SKU model and ability to ship smaller items (covers, pillows, etc.) by air has helped to maintain in-stock availability during this challenging period and has been key differentiator from its competitors.

LTC US,LTC,Dec 15 2021 06:32PM,"LTC Properties, Inc.",Healthcare REITs,LTC: Increasing Estimates for New Mezz Investments ,"We maintain our Hold rating and $35 target price on LTC and increase our earnings estimatesslightly. The REIT has been active on the loan investment front lately, investing $98.5 million of loans in 4Q21. LTC made these investments in 5 different transactions to fund Senior Housing and Skilled Nursing purchases by other entities (average 7.5% yield and 3.5 year term). The pivot towards loans is due to higher pricing on asset sales, but overall it is good to see the team focused on growth instead of restructurings. The new deals will help overcome the declining rental income from previous rent abatements and deferrals due to a difficult operating environment. Our main concern is that other operators could face additional challenges over the next 6-12 months, leading to additional restructurings. Given the potential near-term earnings turbulence and higher leverage, we believe the current valuations (14.2x/13.6x our 2021/2022 estimates) are fair. ","Loan Pivot. The focus on loans will help LTC boost earnings, given the relatively attractive returns on mezz financing compared to outright ownership. This also puts the REIT in a more senior position in the capital stack (providing additional protection). The downside is obviously the short-term nature of the deals (meaning that management will need to reinvest these funds relatively soon). However, we believe this pivot makes sense, given LTC's current cost of capital and should help return the company to growth. $46M Loans. In October, LTC previously announced 4 loans to 3 new regional operators and existing operator to fund the purchase of an SNF, an AL/Memory Care asset, refinance an IL asset and fund the purchase of land for future development. These 4 loans total $46M and yield 7.6% with weighed average lease term of 3.2 years. $52.5M Loan. In December, LTC disclosed its $52.5M loan investment funding the purchase of 13 Senior Housing assets located in the Carolinas. The loan provides $6.1M of capital improvements and $650K for working capital. This investment yields 7.25% and has a 4-year lease term. Stifel Estimates. We increase our 2021E FFO to $2.33 from $2.31 and increase our 2022E FFO to $2.43 from $2.26 (7.5% increase). This implies -21.6% decline in 2021 and 4.2% growth in 2022. The two penny increase in 2021 reflects LTC's strong pace of loan investments thus far in 4Q21. Our prior model assumed no investments in 4Q21. Due to the timing of the $52.5M loan, our model now assumes a $0.02 sequential gain in 1Q22 versus 4Q21 as this investment was made in early December, so the majority of interest will be recognized in 1Q22. Additionally, in 4Q22 we expect LTC to recognize (roughly $1M, or almost $0.03/share/quarter) rent received from recently transitioned Senior Care Center portfolio, now operated by HMG.",Stephen Manaker,"Stephen Manaker, CFA;Tao Qiu, CFA;Seth Canetto;Kevin Stein, CFA",35,,Hold,-,USD,,,,,,,,,,,,STIFEL_LTC_CoNote_2021-12-15.pdf,LTC_CoNote_2021-12-15,,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=8fe994eb-0ca5-486b-90be-0d679878074c&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

Additionally, management highlighted several early, very large, Atlas renewals that drove a dramatic uptick in quarterly billings. While the Atlas growth rate may moderate somewhat during 4Q, we view management's guidance as somewhat conservative (~$10M Q/Q vs $20M in 3Q) based on the strong Atlas usage trends and growing large-scale customer commits to the platform.

MDT US,MDT,Dec 15 2021 10:18AM,Medtronic plc,Medical Technology & Supplies,FDA Diabetes Warning Letter Pushes Sales and EPS Projections Lower ,"Disappointingly, in an 8-K this morning, Medtronic announced receiving an FDA warningletter following the inspection of their Northridge, California diabetes business headquarters. The company noted that the warning letter focuses on the inadequacy of specific medical device quality system requirements at the facility in the areas of risk assessment, corrective and preventive action, complaint handling, device recalls, and reporting of adverse events. In response, Medtronic stated their intention to initiate multiple corrective actions, utilizing resources inside and outside the company. As well, MDT provided financial commentary on near and longer term warning letter impacts, given the possible impact on Diabetes (7% of expected F2022 sales) “business drivers”. The company specifically noted uncertainty on the timing of future U.S. Diabetes product approvals... ","...While not clear as to the extent which the warning letter would slow down the important 780g FDA approval timeline, MDT commentary clearly suggests that the approval could be delayed and come later than hoped. While exact approval timing wasn’t clear, we sensed hope the approval would come “sooner rather than later”. Financially, near-term the company now expects HSD F3Q22 diabetes sales declines and MSD F2022 (April) diabetes revenue declines versus the prior year comps. Accordingly, our F3Q22 diabetes sales projections move to $569M from $590, roughly a 9% Y/Y decline. F2022 revenue moves to $2.298B from $2.35B, a 5% decline versus our prior number. Looking ahead and longer-term, MDT models F2023 total company revenue growth impacts of 50bps to 100bps lower. In turn, we’ve lowered our 2023 sales estimates to $34.35B from $34.59B, reflecting a 6% Y/Y growth rate vs 6.6% previously. Bottom line: The Medtronic diabetes franchise fundamentals continue to be a frustrating aspect of the Geoff Martha Medtronic turnaround story, now likely to take longer to “narrow the competitive gap” that we’ve hoped until the next-gen diabetes products garner FDA approval.

During dinner, we discussed a range of topics but focused largely on TAVR, Mitral, and RDN. Highlights: (1) despite two divisional Presidents noting headwinds including ""whack-a-mole"" like Covid pressures and hospital staffing SHA procedure-pressures, the company emphasized multiple encouraging long-term TAVR share-gain initiatives particularly focused on their highly- competitive valve durability; (2) positive directional transcatheter mitral valve replacement and repair commentary, the highlight Mitral’s importance in driving above-LRP 5 %+ revenue growth; (3) continued confidence in RDN’s value and efficacy, as MDT management underscored the strong existing data backing the therapy’s effectiveness. Net-net we left the dinner more encouraged that MDT's TAVR program will continue to grow above-market, Mitral is making meaningful progress, and RDN will play a growth-enhancing role once approved. ","Speakers Included: Medtronic Chief Clinical and Regulatory Officer Dr. Laura Mauri, Structural Heart & Aortic President Nina Goodheart, Structural Heart & Aortic and Coronary & Renal Denervation Chief Medical Officer Dr. Jeff Popma, Coronary & Renal Denervation President Jason Weidman, and Ryan Weispfenning VP, Investor Relations Near-Term, COVID-Related TAVR Procedure Pressures Continue Into F3Q22... Kicking off the presentation, Structural Heart & Aortic OU President Nina Goodheart expanded upon the company’s F2Q22 (October) TAVR comments, providing an update on current elective procedure trends. As a reminder, during the F2Q22 earnings call, Medtronic noted that ICU beds are feeling the pressure from Covid hospitalizations, putting pressure on TAVR procedures. As well, OU President Goodheart did highlight that staffing pressures where evident are putting some pressure on TAVR volumes. Underscoring the correlation between COVID case ebbs/ flows and TAVR procedure volumes, management has generally seen the pace of TAVR implants improve/decline as COVID cases surge/recede, given the somewhat deferrable nature of TAVR procedures. Compared to previous COVID case surges, elective procedures recently have also been more negatively impacted by hospital staffing shortages, particularly among nurses and technicians, and a general reluctance among patients to return to the hospital. Still, management maintained that Medtronic’s overall TAVR market share remains unchanged, despite the COVID and staff shortage driven pressures on TAVR. ...Longer-Term, Multiple Drivers Support Continued TAVR Market Penetration. While noting other MDT markets such as Coronary are more mature, management emphasized that TAVR remains a sizeable and highly underpenetrated MDT market opportunity. On the TAVR market's longer-term potential, Structural Heart & Aortic OU President Nina Goodheart generally agreed with the $10B 2028 TAVR market forecast shared during the recent Edward’s 2021 Analyst Day. As well, management highlighted multiple positive factors supporting Medtronic’s long runway for sustained TAVR growth in the years ahead.

MD US,MD,Dec 21 2021 12:42PM,"MEDNAX, Inc.",Healthcare - Providers,Updating Estimates On Normal Seasonality ,"We are updating our estimates to reflect lower 2022 contribution from 1Q22 as our prior estimatewas based upon 1Q21 numbers with provider relief fund contributions and a higher margin. We also believe consensus estimates are high for the quarter give the normal seasonal trend. However, our FY22 adjusted EBITDA estimate is only slightly lower and still above $270M management guidance. We believe MEDNAxX is shifting to growth mode in the next two years as it builds out pediatrics primary and urgent care clinics. We think valuation is fair considering mid-to-high single digit earnings growth. Reiterate Hold. ","Lowering 1Q22 Revenue / Adj. EBITDA; Consensus Seems High - Our prior estimate did not factor in the $8M / $4M boost in 1Q21 from Provider Relief Fund, which MEDNAX (MD) will not book in 1Q22. Historically first quarter is also the weakest of the year in terms of margin. Adjusting for these factors, we are lowering our 1Q22 revenue / adj. EBITDA to $462.4M / $47.4M from $474.9M / $56.8M, accounting for 23% / 17% of FY22 total. Street consensus 1Q22 revenue / adj. EBITDA estimates for 1Q22 are $472M / $52M, implying a margin of 11% which we think are high compared to historical patterns and will need to move lower. Small Adjustments for FY22/FY23 Estimates; Still See FY22 Adj. EBITDA Above $270M Guidance - Our FY22 revenue / EBITDA goes down slightly to $1,989.2M / $270.7M from $2001.7M / $271.7M. We lower FY23 revenue by $12M to $2,075.6M and our adjusted EBITDA estimate is roughly unchanged at $287.4M. Our 2022 adjusted EBITDA is still above the $270M guidance. We believe MD could get moderate operating leverage on practice-level expenses, garner incremental G&A savings from recent initiatives including the R1 RCM transaction, and additional savings on interest expense as it refinance the $1B 6.25% senior note due in 2026. Therefore, we expect adjusted EBITDA to grow at low-to-mid single digits organically with 2-3% from external growth as management invests to open 100 pediatric primary and urgent care clinics in the next few years. Our FY22/FY23 adjusted EBITDA estimates suggest 7.2%/6.2% y/y growth. Valuation Is Fair; Reiterate Hold - MD trades at 11x forward EV/EBITDA and 15x next twelve month's EPS. We think valuation is reasonable relative to the 7-8% growth in the next two years for EBITDA / EPS excluding one-time items. We lower our target price to $30 from $31 based on adjusted estimates.

MNST US,MNST,Dec 15 2021 04:31PM,Monster Beverage Corporation,Beverages,"Moving Beyond the Strategic Unknown, 2022 Outlook Favorable; Buy, $107 Target ","The probability of a strategic transaction with Constellation Brands has decreased since mediareports on November 21*, though we also think a three-way global joint venture with The Coca- Cola Company to sell alcoholic beverages makes sense and would be value accretive to all participants. It also reinforced our long-held view that an acquisition of Monster by The Coca- Cola Company makes the most sense given meaningful cost and sales synergies, while also removing succession planning risk. Fundamentally, we see upside for MNST shares in 2022 given continued strong U.S. energy drink category growth (17% y/y growth through November), favorable comparisons as Monster laps supply chain-driven out-of-stocks that hurt market share, solid innovation, ongoing International share gains, and expectations for sequentially improving gross margin as key input costs have largely peaked. We also think the current $3.0bn cash balance can be used to repurchase shares. ","Favorable risk/reward for MNST shares from current levels. We see upside for MNST shares in 2022 reflecting multiple expansion given the current discount to peers and solid fundamentals driven by continued strong U.S. energy drink category growth (17% y/y growth through November), favorable comparisons as Monster laps supply chain-driven out-of-stocks that hurt market share, solid innovation, and ongoing International share gains. We also think the current $3.0bn cash balance (~6% of the current market cap) can be used to repurchase shares. Lessening inflation. We also expect cost inflation to become less pronounced largely given recent aluminum price declines (down ~17% from October highs, accounting for ~25% of COGS), with gross margin estimated to modestly improve sequentially through 2022. Relatedly, list prices on Monster have continued to increase as the company reduces promotional allowances to offset inflation, up 1.9% since early September and up 2.8% over the last four weeks, compared to a 0.6% increase over the prior 12-weeks and a 0.2% increase in 1H21, with similar dynamics for Red Bull. We think this suggests a rational competitive environment, and supports price increases, though none have been announced yet. Early look at_2022 innovation. We anticipate Monster will announce four new products at its January 13, 2022 investor event - Ultra Peachy Keen, Aussie Lemonade (a juice SKU), Watermelon Rehab and Reign Sherbet. We estimate that Ultra Peachy Keen and Aussie Lemonade will be most impactful, potentially adding ~300bps-400bps to 2022 sales growth based on the contribution from recent Ultra and juice line extensions over a TTM basis post introduction. We assume all will launch in February 2022. Why Coke as an acquirer? Recent media reports regarding Monster exploring a strategic transition with Constellation Brands reinforced our long-held view that an acquisition of Monster by The Coca-Cola Company makes the most sense given meaningful cost and sales synergies, with minimal integration risk for Coke given it already distributes Monster in nearly all markets globally. It also removes succession planning risk at Monster. That said, while we have no knowledge of any discussions, we think Coke is likely at least a year away from potentially acquiring Monster given the recently announced $6bn acquisition of BodyArmor and a large potential tax liability.",Mark S.

MRC stock has performedpoorly over the last few weeks as fears around COVID increases/Omicron has taken its toll on oil prices. While a significant part of MRC's business does still depend on commodity prices, year- to-date the gas utilities business (uncorrelated to the commodity price) was 38% of revenue and the downstream, industrial, and energy transition business (less correlated to commodity prices) represented 29% of revenue. MRC's revenues are less correlated to oil prices than investors think. We believe the recent dislocation provides a compelling entry point. ","We visited MRC's Houston Operations Complex at LaPorte — it includes the Regional Distribution Center, the Valve & Engineering Center and the Valve Engineering & Modification Center, pipe yard and office space with CEO Rob Saltiel, CFO Kelly Youngblood and other members of the executive and local management teams: Safety is a critical focus with management investing in machinery and equipment to help lessen the inherent risk of injuries doing this type of physical work. Management noted it was especially important during the current tight labor market to ensure its workforce remains fit and healthy. The La Porte location demonstrates MRC's core distribution skillset with the company highlighting multiple innovations around packaging, product movement, product storage, and logistics that contribute to improved efficiency and lower costs. Changes to inbound freight specifications and packaging reduce product handling, and therefore costs, as MRC continues to streamline product flow. Valve actuation adds value for customers: During our tour, we saw a number of examples of value-added work MRC provides to its customers, which centered around valve actuation. Adding actuation to valves contains a number of steps including welding, weld X-rays to ensure quality, adding stems and extensions, testing, and quality control. Without this service from MRC, customers would typically acquire the valve and the actuator and have to use a third party to assemble the system. Using MRC allows the customer to source the product and acquire the value-added services in one spot, reducing the time taken and cost to the customer. MRC intends to further expend the valve engineering and valve modification businesses, which are accretive to margins. Management remains bullish on 2022 spending growth: MRC continues to see double-digit growth in 2022 with all businesses contributing to the growth outlook. Management sees the highest secular growth in the gas utilities business, which would be expected to increase its percentage of revenue and further dampen the cyclicality of the business relative to historical patterns.",Nathan Jones,"Nathan Jones, CFA;Adam M.

MTN US,MTN,Dec 09 2021 11:00PM,"Vail Resorts, Inc.",Gaming & Leisure,F1Q22 Review: F1Q and FY Guidance Down the Middle; Pass Sales Accelerated Through End of Selling Season ,"MTN reported a mostly inline F1Q, with Adj. EBITDA modestly better than our at-guidanceestimate and FY guidance left intact. Encouragingly, pass sales accelerated to +21% Y/Y (+45% vs. 2019/20) through the end of the selling season, vs. investor expectations coming out of F4Q that generally called for modest deceleration (though we heard some cite upside bias from solid website traffic around Nov/Dec price hike/cutoff). Commentary on the call further reinforced our view that MTN will likely benefit from pent-up luxury demand this ski season, albeit partially offset by challenging early season conditions. While positive on incremental pass conversion, a healthy luxury consumer, and a potential flight-to-quality trade into year-end, we remain Hold- rated for now given MTN still trades near peak historical multiples despite most of Gaming & Leisure resetting while F1Q typically sees a sell the news trade with pass selling wrapped up. TP goes to $358 from $355. ","F1Q22 modestly ahead of guidance on end of season Australian re-openings. MTN reported Resort adj. EBITDA of ($108M), modestly better than our at-guidance ($112M) and inline to Consensus. Resort net revenues of $175M were -10% to Consensus, while margins of -61.9% compared to Street's -55.8%. While Australia was subject to closures and/or stay- at-home orders for most of the quarter, resorts were able to open for the final weeks of the ski season providing upside to management's prior guidance. This was partially offset by the Caldor fire in CA, which saw summer operations in Tahoe close early. Drilling in by segment, Mountain revenues of $109M were -14% to Consensus, with adj. EBITDA of ($111M) comparing to Street's ($113M). Skier visits were -58% to Consensus, with ETP +4%. Ancillary revenues were mixed, with Ski School/F&B/Retail & Rental/Other coming in -70%/+45%/-7%/+17% to Consensus. The Lodging segment came in modestly behind, likely fire related, with revenues of $66.0M -4% to Consensus and adj. EBITDA of $2.6M -41%. Pass sales accelerated into December cutoff. Per usual, MTN updated North America pass sales growth rates (units and total dollars) through the end of the selling season (12/5). Sales of Epic passes were up +47%/21% (units/sales dollars) Y/Y, or +76%/+45% vs. the 2019/20 season (the last ""clean"" pre-COVID selling season). This compares to +42%/+17% reported at F4Q earnings (through 9/17), or +67%/+45% vs. the 2019/20 season. We believe results are generally ahead expectations coming out of F4Q earnings, as we think investors were calling for a modest deceleration in light of demand pull forward and more difficult fall compares (due to the reservation system in place during 2020/21). That said, we did hear some investors highlight healthy web traffic data around the November price hike deadline and December cutoff as potential signs of upside. Effective pass price was -17% Y/Y, despite MTN enacting the 20% price cut, with management highlighting stronger-than-anticipated trade-ups within legacy passholders. Consistent with the F4Q update, management called out growth across all major pass types (Epic, Local, Day), pass holder origins (destination vs. local), as well as customer types (returning, relapse, new to database, etc.) Read on for more thoughts on MTN's earnings.",Jeffrey A.

MTW US,MTW,Dec 13 2021 05:14PM,"Manitowoc Company, Inc. (The)",Machinery,Analyst Day Takeaways: Strategic Initiatives & Infrastructure Tailwinds Help Drive Toward Aspirational Targets ,"We attended the MTW analyst day where management went into additional detail on its fourstrategic priorities including 1) growing tower rental in EU, 2) growing tower sales in China, 3) NPD of AT cranes and 4) expanding aftermarket in NA. We believe the pivot into aftermarket, rental, and distribution in NA with the acquisitions of Aspen and H&E crane is notable and should help to drive less cyclicality and higher margins for the business over time. MTW also unveiled aspirational targets of ~$2.5B and revenue and >$275M of adjusted EBITDA (11%+ margin) over the next five years helped by initiatives and the recent passage of the infrastructure bill. MTW also noted that supply chain challenges have continued into the 4Q21 and expects 2021 results to be at the low end of prior guidance. ","MTW expands on growth initiatives. After several years of cost cutting and improving product quality, MTW is pivoting to reinvigorate its growth engine. MTW remains focused on executing on its growth priorities including 1) growing tower rental in EU, 2) growing tower sales in China, 3) NPD of AT cranes and 4) expanding aftermarket in NA. Additional details: OnEU tower rental, MTW is investing ~$15 million in 2021 into the rental fleet after piloting a $5 million investment in 2020. Opportunity in this area is significant, as the entire EU tower crane TAM between rental, new, used and aftermarket is estimated in the ~$3 billion range. In China, MTW is focused on participating in the tower crane market which has ~40,000 tower crane sales annually. Currently, MTW is selling ~300 tower cranes annually. Notably, the Potain brand has lengthy roots in the Chinese market as it was originally introduced in the 1980s. MTW has introduced a number of tower models now designed for the Chinese market. In AT cranes, there remains an opportunity for NPD and MTW intends to introduce several new models over the next five years. This follows 60+ new product introductions over the past five years in other crane types which has helped drive growth in those models. MTW has also made meaningful progress on expanding aftermarket in NA with the acquisitions of Aspen and H&E crane which will be the foundation for the new MGX Equipment Services business. These deals will help drive the opportunity in aftermarket which currently accounts for <20% of sales. Supply chain remains challenging in the 4Q21 and similar to the 3Q21. As a result, MTW pointed to 2021 results coming in at the lower end of the previously stated range. We adjusted our estimates for the 4Q21 as a result. Aspirational targets reiterated. MTW reiterated its longer term financial targets including revenues of $2.5B and adjusted EBITDA of $275M (11.0% margin). Of note, MTW expects to generate revenues $1.725-1.775B and adjusted EBITDA of $100-110M in 2021 (6.0% margin). Targets are expected to be achieved through its strategic initiatives outlined above. Related to growth, MTW expects to generate $500M in revenue growth through breakthrough initiatives including acquisitions ($250M contribution) and market growth (also $250M contribution). MTW assumes normalized market growth through the cycle (aided by the infrastructure bill), favorable pricing conditions, and continued margin expansion from its LEAN initiatives.",Stanley S.

NETI US,NETI,Dec 09 2021 05:29PM,Eneti Inc.,Maritime,"Focus on the Future, Not the Past at Eneti ","Eneti is all about future expectations. By 2025, the company should own 7 WTIV and be a partialowner in a Jones Act WTIV which should be able to produce north of $150 million in EBITDA. The Seajacks acquisition gives the company some operational and commercial contacts that should help facilitate the delivery of the two newbuilds. Longer term, the wind installation vessel market should grow, and should be a good place to be. Given that the equity raise is encouraging some investors to head for the exists, as that selling pressure abates, the incremental capital allowed the company to place its second newbuild order which should increase the company's earnings power. We believe that as the WTIV market tightens, the stock should reflect a much more optimistic future than what is currently priced in. ","Earnings. Eneti's third quarter earnings came in below our estimates, with vessel operating expenses posting the largest variance. Vessel OPEX also includes project costs, which can vary dramatically based on the start up and ongoing needs of different projects. Seajacks. On August 12th, the company completed the acquisition of Seajacks International, which we discuss in our previous report, Extreme Makeover: Turning Eneti from Pauper to Prince. The merger added five WTIVs, which we are modeling to add an estimated $75-100 million in annual EBITDA, with incremental increases as newbuilds are delivered. Contracts. Currently, the wind installation vessel market works on project by project contracts. As a result, cash flows will likely be lumpy. However, should demand outpace vessel supply, that could change as installers potentially look to guarantee vessel availability. However, that is the bull case, and something we aren't forecasting today. A lot can happen in 3 years. Fortunately, the Scylla and the Zaratan, the fleet's moneymakers, are contracted on projects in Asia for the majority of 2022, which provides some cash flow visibility. For the three smaller NG2500 vessels, utilization should likely be low as the vessels trade off working for oil and gas companies and servicing >4 MW offshore wind turbines. While last year two of the three NG2500 vessels were unemployed, they are much less significant relative to the two larger vessels. With all three vessel currently in Europe, we expect the three to oscillate between short-term contracts throughout 2022. Fleet. The two newbuilds on order should be delivered in Q3-2024 and Q2-2025, respectively. That will increase NETI's current fleet size from five to seven WTIVs. NETI is also closing in on U.S. Jones Act WTIV opportunity, which it should own be able to own 25-49.9%. Balance Sheet. It took a lot of effort (and capital raising) and was an ill-timed sale of its dry bulk assets (hindsight being 20/20), but NETI has made the transition to being a wind turbine installation vessel operator. The debt balance currently only sits at 20%, but that should go negative as the ~$175m of incremental equity capital hits the balance sheet in 4Q. Assuming incremental cash flows from the existing 5 WTIV vessels, we don't expect leverage to move above 30% assuming the current orderbook stands. While obviously, the future could be worse than we expect, a leverage profile that low (in shipping) should give the company stability in the less exceptional years. Valuation. With the equity raise, the shares have been hammered in the midst of an investor base turnover. While third quarter results weren't anything to write home about, we expect that as selling pressure abates, the share should start to reflect a more optimistic future than what is currently priced in. We expect shares to appreciate closer to our $14 target price, which is based on our discounted cash flow model that assumes annualized EBITDA of ~$180m in 2025 and uses a 14% discount rate.",Benjamin J.

NKE US,NKE,Dec 13 2021 10:34PM,"Nike, Inc.",Sports and Lifestyle Brands,Nike Pushes into the Metaverse with the Acquisition of RTFKT ,"Nike announced the acquisition of RTFKT (pronounced “artifact”), an NFT studio focused ondigital fashion and collectables. The RTFKT transaction signals the sincerity of NIKE’s interest in Metaverse opportunities. Nike’s unmatched brand recognition, scale, and patented technologies set the stage for expansion of the digital footprint into Metaverse opportunities including the highly-anticipated launch of CryptoKicks (U.S. patent granted in 2019). ","WHAT HAPPENED: On December 13'"", 2021, Nike acquired RTFKT, a creator of Metaverse- ready sneakers and collectables, for an undisclosed amount. Known for its virtual sneaker designs, RTFKT uses the latest in gaming engines, NFTs, blockchain technologies, and augmented reality to create one-of-a-kind sneaker designs and digital artifacts. Founded in 2020, RTFKT has already developed a track-record of achievement, highlighted in its February 2021 partnership with 18-year-old artist, Fewocious, which reportedly resulted in sales of over $3 million of digital sneakers in under 7 minutes. In late November 2021, RTFKT dropped CLONEX, an NFT avatar partnership with Japanese artist, Takashi Murakami. 55.7% of avatars in the drop were sold during a presale to RTFKT holders, 41.8% were sold to the public, and 2.5% were sold to the RTFKT team, artists, and community. The CLONEX project has already gained almost $69 million in transaction volume at an average sale price of approximately $15,200 in over 4,500 transactions. RTFKT has also hosted a number of “Forging Events” where NFT owners may unlock redemption capabilities for physical items to be shipped directly to the owners. Acquiring loyal and established base of RTFKT fans, Nike reportedly plans to invest in the brand and grow RTFKT’s creative community. WHY IT MATTERS: Nike’s acquisition and investment into the RTFKT brand could accelerate the long-anticipated launch of CryptoKicks and the potential expansion into the world of virtual sneakers and apparel. Nike got the digital ball rolling in in October 2021, by filing 7 trademark applications related to the creation and sale of virtual sneakers and apparel. On September 12h Nike partnered with Robolox in the creation of NIKELAND, a virtual headquarters within the Robolox platform which has garnered over +7 million visits to date. With increasing momentum into NFTs from major brands (Adidas announced partnerships with the Bored Ape Yacht Club and Coinbase in November 2021), the acquisition of RTFKT will give Nike a boost in the race to gain traction with NFT collectors and digital fashion enthusiasts. We appreciate the strategic value of the acquisition to provide the platform, established brand, existing community of RTFKT NFT owners, and talent to expedite the expansion into Nike’s potential NFT offerings and capitalize on the opportunity.

NKE US,NKE,Dec 15 2021 10:12PM,"Nike, Inc.",Sports and Lifestyle Brands,NKE F2Q22 Preview: Trimming FY22 Numbers for Stiff Near- Term China Challenge; TP to $202 ,"We are trimming F2Q-F4Q22 sales estimates to reflect challenges in Greater China (regionrevision -5ppts, flowing to -§0.09 EPS pressure in FY22). Near-term, we think consensus China estimates are too ambitious. The consolidated FY22 outlook, however, holds enough margin for error to sustain and we expect a reiteration. Big picture, our more conservative stance on FY22 does not change our above consensus view for FY23 but we are tempering FY23 estimates to reflect China uncertainty and recent strength in the U.S. dollar. Supply-oriented shocks are likely non-recurring, and represent opportunity for a positive reversal in FY23. Any weakness in NKE shares could be an opportunity for accumulation in a category-dominant global growth company that is evolving to a higher return model. We reaffirm our Buy rating though have lowered our 12 mos. TP to $202 from $213. ","What’s happening: Nike is scheduled to report F2Q22 (November ‘21) earnings after close on Monday, December 20"". We are trimming our Greater China revenue outlook ahead of the report and see potential risk to near-term consensus China revenue estimates and consolidated EPS estimates. While still above consensus, we are also trimming FY23 estimates to reflect more caution on China and recent strength of the U.S. dollar. Estimate Changes: Challenges in Greater China appear greater than contemplated in our prior estimates, and we are assuming -5ppts incremental headwind to regional sales growth for F2Q, F3Q, and F4Q. Revised Stifel Greater China estimates are below consensus for both FY2Q and FY3Q before rebounding above consensus in FY4Q. We assume a decremental margin of 50%, decreasing quarterly EPS by $0.03 for each of the next three quarters. Per the table below, these estimates put us below consensus for both Greater China revenue and EPS in both FY2Q and FY3Q. Despite above consensus EPS estimates in FY4Q, we remain below consensus for the fiscal year. Looking to FY23, we reaffirm our constant currency estimates for all other segments (North America, EMEA, APLA, and Converse), though have taken a slightly more cautious stance on Greater China and are revising estimates to reflecting recent strength in the U.S. dollar (~1ppt. impact to growth).

Specifically, NOG plans to raise its common dividend by $0.03 or greater each quarter through year-end 2023, or ~20% average growth per quarter at $50 oil.

We are primarily focused on two catalysts. First, capital discipline and full- field development are two of the most prevalent themes across the E&P sector, irrespective of the basin. These themes, along with limited buyer completion for non-op acreage, create a buying opportunity for NOG. In light of the current environment, we expect most operators to sell down their non-op exposure to focus on operated activities (due to shareholder focus on capital discipline) and most non-op producers to sell down their non-op interest (due to lack of funds). Based on our analysis, every 1,000 net acres acquired in the Core and Tier 1 fairway generates ~$20,000/acre of value arbitrage for NOG. Second, the closing of the Veritas transaction in Q122. Notably, the expected FCF for 2022 on the acquired asset is 60% of what the company delivered in Q321 on an annualized basis. Valuation and recommendation.

Through various channel checks we keep hearing similar sentiment, ""there is a war on talent going on right now, especially in software."" The rise of digital transformation projects has stretched implementation service providers and internal teams thin across the industry. EY has identified certain needs in the industry and is investing accordingly, first expanding with Microsoft in August 2021, and now with ServiceNow. For ServiceNow, this expansion comes with the goal of creating a $1bn business unit in the US by 2025. We maintain our Buy rating and $725 target price on shares of NOW. ","ServiceNow and EY Expand Strategic Alliance The war on talent has created opportunities for organizations and large service providers to differentiate from competitors by heavily investing go-to market and implementation teams. EY has been identifying areas of opportunity and attacking the market by expanding its managed services support for businesses like ServiceNow and Microsoft. In August, EY announced it is further aligning its business with Microsoft's Cloud efforts to create a long-term strategy and target a $15bn growth opportunity over the next five years. This morning, EY announced a similar expansion with ServiceNow to help companies become more agile and productive in response to the rapid developments and transformations that customers are undergoing. Both EY and NOW will invest in developing new offerings to streamline enterprise operations, with a focus on finance and tax services to address a $1bn opportunity over the next five years. As a leading provider in workflow management software, NOW can support organizations as they rethink tax automation and finance processes to promote collaboration across multiple systems. The Work from Anywhere movement has made it harder for companies to maintain productivity across departments, and has driven increased investments in Cloud products that aid in collaboration. The two companies will help customers by streamlining reporting, documenting, and approval processes for finance professionals. In our view, EY will leverage its vertical industry experience to promote and drive adoption of NOW's platform, enhancing operational efficiencies for customers. As part of the process, EY will also expand its own use of NOW's platform to power its managed services. We maintain our Buy rating and $725 target price on shares of NOW.",Tom M. Roderick,"Tom M.

","Special Dividend during 4Q21 After today's market close, PDCE announced that its Board of Directors approved a special dividend of $50 million ($0.50 per share) in addition to the company's quarterly base dividend of $12 million ($0.12 per share) to be paid on 12/29/21. PDCE will achieve its 2021 shareholder return goal of more than $210MM via the special dividend, base dividend, and share repurchases. Management plans to maintain an active share repurchase program and will continue to buyback shares through YE21. With this announcement, the company's 2021 dividend yield of 1.7% is second highest in our mid-cap oil peer group and more than double the peer average of 0.8% (Figure 1). With its 3Q21 earnings release, PDCE noted that a special dividend may be necessary to meet its shareholder return goal due to potential limitations with the existing share repurchase program. These included the number of shares scheduled to be repurchased at various share prices and the number of trading days in 4Q21.",Michael S. Scialla,Michael S.

PDCO US,PDCO,Dec 01 2021 06:10PM,"Patterson Companies, Inc.",Medical Technology & Supplies,Good (but Not Great) Print; Animal Health Stands Out; Reiterate Hold ,"The headline is that Patterson once again beat our/consensus top and bottom line estimatesand raised its FY22 EPS guidance. Adjusted EPS of $0.58 was $0.05 above our $0.53E ($0.07 above Street) and the company raised FY22 EPS guidance by a similar amount (FY22 EPS midpoint moves from $2.00 to $2.05). While the beat and raise is encouraging, we believe there were some shortcomings to the print. F2Q22 gross margin of 19.8% was below our 20.6%E (opex leverage offset GM weakness); Dental revenue of $622MM slightly missed our $638MME (Dental equipment the culprit after a solid F1Q22); and management seemed to convey a bit more of a F4Q weighted 2H relative to pre-COVID levels. Our prior $2.04E increases slightly by $0.03 (F3Q22 modestly lower offsetting F2Q22 outperformance), and while we acknowledge better execution by the current management team and the flexibility for future (accretive) M&A, we reiterate our Hold rating. ","Dental. Patterson reported F2Q22 Dental sales of $622.2MM, below our estimate of $638.0MM. Internal revenue declined -2% y/y, which was below our +0.8% estimate but above management's internal expectations. The decline in internal revenue growth is partially attributable to a -13% y/y decrease in infection prevention control product sales, driven by tough comps and continued pricing pressure. Encouragingly, core consumables sales ex- PPE grew +3%. Equipment sales were down -3% compared to our +5% estimate, as the company continued to face supply chain issues, which management expects to continue and then moderate by early- to mid-calendar 2022. As a result of continued supply delays, particularly in core equipment, the company has a healthy backlog of orders, which it expects to fill in coming quarters. DS World seemingly is acting as a solid tailwind, with management noting that most of the sales generated from the event should impact F2H, with only a small portion recognized in F2Q. Animal Health. Sales for the Animal Health segment came in at $1,027.5MM, well above our and Street's estimates of $928.0MM and $960.4MM, respectively. The segment's internal revenue growth of +16.2% y/y was above our +5.0% estimate, largely driven by strong Consumables sales growth (+15.8% vs. Stifel +5.0%). Companion Animal revenue increased +21% y/y but is expected to moderate in the coming quarters as Patterson laps tough comps from COVID-induced acceleration in pet adoption trends. On the Production Animal side, revenue growth accelerated for the second consecutive quarter to +11% led by cattle, swine, and dairy exports running above the 5-year average, reflecting improving global demand. Management expects Production Animal to continue improving steadily in F2H22. Guidance. The company raised EPS guidance by $0.05 (vs. $0.07 beat on prior Street F2Q22 estimates) from $1.95-$2.05 to $2.00-$2.10. Management expects F2H22 EPS to be weighted more heavily towards 4Q and was clear that the cadence is specific to EPS, driven by expense timing, and is less meaningful to revenue. Our fiscal 2022 revenue estimate increases slightly from ~$6.4B to ~$6.5B, and our full-year EPS estimate increases modestly to $2.07.

PDI US,PDI,Dec 14 2021 12:05AM,PIMCO Dynamic Income Fund,Closed-End Funds,Initiating Coverage of PDI with a Hold Rating ,We are initiating coverage of the PIMCO Dynamic Income Fund (PDI) with a Hold rating on theshares. PDI is a multi-sector credit fund that seeks to primarily generate current income and secondarily capital appreciation. The fund seeks to achieve its objective by using a dynamic investment strategy with the ability to invest in debt obligations and other income producing securities of any type and credit quality with few restrictions. PDI acquired the assets of two multi-sector closed-end funds managed by PIMCO following the market close on 12/10/21. ,"We are initiating coverage of shares of PDI with a Hold rating. The shares of two multi-asset fixed-income funds managed by PIMCO merged into PDI as of the market close on 12/10/21. We formerly covered shares of one of the acquired funds in this reorganization (delisted ticker of PCl) with a Hold rating. Our discontinuing coverage note for PCI can be seen here. Weare attracted to shares of PDI because of its dynamic/flexible investment strategy, highly diversified merged assets, and high distribution rate. However, we rate shares as a Hold mainly due to its premium valuation. PDI’s investment guidelines allow its managers to shift between an array of security types. As of 10/29/21, the broad asset class allocations of the merged assets were mortgage related securities, domestic corporate credit, and international corporate and sovereign debt. As of 12/13/21, PDI pays investors a 10.53% distribution rate. Since the fund trades at a premium of 3.76%, its portfolio must generate a 10.93% distribution rate to avoid a declining NAV over time. We think that PDI’s modest leverage adjusted duration of 4.6 years as of 10/29/21 can help limit the portfolio’s sensitivity to long-term interest rates, relative to other fixed-income funds that offer a similar distribution rate. We urge investors to wait to purchase shares due to the fund’s premium valuation. As of 12/13/21, shares of PDI traded at a premium of 3.76% to its NAV. PDI is a complex fund best suited for aggressive investors, in our view. As of 10/29/21, the fund’s effective leverage ratio was 44.9%. This is one of the highest of all closed-end funds.",Alexander G. Reiss,Alexander G.

PH US,PH,Dec 05 2021 05:22PM,Parker-Hannifin Corporation,Multi-Industry,PH: The Hitchhiker's Guide To Trading PH Stock; PMI At ~54 Suggests ~12% Short-Term Upside ,"We examined correlations of PH stock price to multiple data series and found that, by a widemargin, the highest correlation is the average monthly y/y change in PH stock price relative to the y/y change in the global PM/® index with a strong R-square of ~0.54 (0.62 pre-COVID). Over cycles and multiple time frames in the last 20 years PH stock has been a strong outperformer relative to the market and provided investors with outsized returns. We believe using this correlation to the global PM® as a guide should allow investors to trade around positions to enhance what has already amounted to strong returns with a ""buy and hold"" strategy. In the short term, our models predict volatility in PH stock through the summer, and our scenario analysis suggests a positive _risk/reward outlook over the next 12 months. ","While we show in this analysis that the y/y change in PH stock has a strong correlation to the y/y change in the Global PMI® index, we also note that over cycles PH stock has shown strong outperformance to the overall market.

With that said, we believe the correct timing of trading PH stock has offered investors the opportunity to earn significant returns, and we see no reason why that won’t repeat through cycles. We also believe we have identified a strong correlation between y/y PH stock price changes and a relatively predictable Global PMI® cycle that provides investors with a guide to trading PH stock with a one-year or shorter time horizon.

PINE US,PINE,Dec 02 2021 06:52PM,"Alpine Income Property Trust, Inc.",Triple-Net REITs,One Down One To Go ,"Closes On HGV Assets. After the close, Alpine Income Property announced the sale of itsoffice properties leased to Hilton Grand Vacations (HGV, $49.50, NC) in Orlando, FL for $24.5 million, or a 7.5% cap rate. As of the end of 3Q, HGV accounted for ~8% of ABR. Of note, with its 3Q earnings, management noted they had an office property under contract for sale at the time, and it has been well telegraphed that the company is looking to sell the office assets in order to become a pure-play retail triple-net company. The company will likely use the proceeds for future acquisitions. ","One Step Closer To Pure-Play Retail Company. Following the sale of the HGV assets, the company has one remaining office asset in its portfolio, which is leased to Wells Fargo. Management has previously noted that this property is being marketed. Following the sale of the remaining property, PINE will be a pure-play retail triple-net REIT. We believe that this should result in multiple expansion. Dividend. Last month, PINE raised its quarterly dividend to $0.27 for an above-average yield of 6.0% vs the triple-net average of 4.9%. The 73.4% 2022E FAD payout ratio is slightly below the peer average of 75.0%. Maintaining Estimates. We are maintaining our current estimates. Balance Sheet.

PING US,PING,Dec 01 2021 04:57PM,Ping Identity Holding Corp.,Enterprise Software,Investor Day: Focusing on Accelerating ARR on the Road to $1B ,"Consistent with our preview, Ping held an upbeat Analyst Day today, where it provided anoverview of its strategy, broadening portfolio, and competitive differentiation as it pursues a $50B addressable market across Workforce and Customer IAM use cases. Importantly, Ping offered healthy medium-term ambitions, calling for ARR Y/Y growth to re- accelerate to 20%+ in F4Q22 and to 25%-30% Y/Y growth in F4Q24, along with a UFCF margin of 10%-15% in FY24 (Rule of 40), as it pursues $1B in ARR in coming years. Management is confident in these targets given improving execution (3 straight quarters of accelerating ARR/NRR), along with a broad and growing cloud portfolio and early traction with SaaS/newer products. Net/net, we are pleased with ambitions of returning to 20%+ ARR growth in coming years and continue to believe other events, such as Vista exiting and the Federal opportunity/channel expansion, can be positive drivers in coming periods. ","Quick hits from Analyst Day: Strategy aligning around IAM, with an increasing focus on Customer IAM. Ping provided broad overview of its IAM opportunity, strategy, and portfolio across Workforce and Customer use cases. At its core, through a combination of organic development and selective tuck-in M&A, Ping has assembled an enterprise-focused identity platform around Authentication (proving you are indeed you), Authorization (providing fine-grained and dynamic access to specified resources), Verification (proving the real identity of the person, meaning not a bot or take-over attempt), Risk and Fraud (using risk signals throughout the session to consistently authenticate), API security (provide complete visibility into APIs), and Orchestration (integrate everyone and everything). Given the growing importance of IAM due to a number of factors (cybersecurity mandates, regulation/compliance, WFA/Zero Trust, improved user experience, privacy, etc.) across Ping's Enterprise focus (e.g., global companies with over $500M in annual revenue), Ping believes it is going after a $50B+ Enterprise Identity market in 2023, comprised of a $23B Workforce Identity TAM and a $27B Customer Identity TAM. Ping also believes the overall [AM market is growing at a 13% CAGR from 2021-2023 and the Customer IAM market is growing at an even faster 16% CAGR over the same period. With CIAM a larger part of the mix (over 50% of mix), growing faster, and less competitive than Workforce IAM (as CIAM is mostly greenfield), it is not surprising to see the company continue leaning into the CIAM opportunity. Reaffirmed existing F4Q21 and FY21 guidance. Ping reaffirmed previously issued F4Q21 and FY21 guidance. See later in the report for a closer look at guidance. Offered medium-term ambitions. Ping provided medium-term ambitions for the first time, including: F4Q21: SaaS ARR as a % of Total ARR to be 25%",Adam C. Borg,"Adam C. Borg;Brad R.

PLAB US,PLAB,Dec 05 2021 02:25PM,"Photronics, Inc.",Semiconductor Capital Equipment,4Q21 Preview: Some Mixed Data Points to Monitor but 2022 Outlook Intact; Limited New Catalysts Keep Us at Hold Rating ,"On Wednesday before the market open, Photronics is scheduled to report 4Q21 (Oct) earningsresults and host a conference call later that morning (8:30am ET). We expect the company to generally meet our estimates of $175 million in revenue and pro-forma EPS of $0.25, including options. While overall demand likely remained healthy, we believe there were some pockets of interest (notably ICs related to the Chinese smartphone market), where higher inventory builds and demand questions could lead to some near-term softness. With that being said, we remain comfortable with our current 2022 outlook (and estimates). We are not expecting any major surprises to emerge, and this also means a potential lack of new catalysts to spur the name. We remain more cautious on the long-term prospects of the merchant photomask market, and in turn, maintain our lower multiples and our Hold rating. ","From a demand perspective, we believe broad trends are generally healthy, but there are pockets we would be monitoring on the call. We believe there has been some inventory building on the China smartphone IC end, and this could impact some near-term wafer starts as this marketplace has seen some share shifts to high-end brands. We also believe there has been some increased volatility on the memory end, particularly with second tier players in the Asia marketplace. While some of this could be supply constraint-driven, it can impact wafer starts, which could trickle down to Photronics’ business in the near term. At the same time, we believe other foundry customers for Photronics continue to see healthy demand trends and this leaves us making no changes to our 2022 forecasts at this time. We believe display trends, particularly in China, generally remain healthy, although potential inventory in the local smartphone market could impact display demand as well. Given the supply chain issues across the technology ecosystem, we will also be monitoring management's comments if it has been impacted on the materials procurement front, and whether higher freight and logistics costs are impacting the company (which could be evident in its margin profile). While we believe the pricing environment remains favorable for Photronics, mix, utilization, and supply chain-related costs all could potentially impact margins somewhat, so this will be an area we will be looking at closely. January Quarter Outlook: Our current 1Q22 (Jan) estimates call for $170 million in revenue and pro-forma EPS of $0.23, including options. The January quarter is typically a seasonally down quarter, but over the last two years, strong demand trends have driven sequential upticks. Last quarter, the company delivered strong margin results but there could be more headwinds in the near term at this time. As we have noted, our demand outlook for 2022 has not changed dramatically, and thus, we maintain our current FY/CY22 estimates (and would not be surprised if we do not make many major revisions following the earnings release/ conference call).",Patrick J.

PLBY US,PLBY,Dec 02 2021 05:48PM,"PLBY Group, Inc.",Sports and Lifestyle Brands,Cardi B Enlisted as Creative Director in Residence and Founding Creative Director of CENTERFOLD Platform ,"Ahead of the CENTERFOLD launch this month, PLBY Group’s announced partnership withCardi B is validation of opportunity with provocative global entertainment icons. The relationship appears mutually beneficial and opens two core business avenues, 1) co-branded Cardi B x Playboy fashion merchandise and sexual wellness products, and more importantly 2) the creative input and participation of Cardi B for the launch of the CENTERFOLD platform. CENTERFOLD, now with the star-power of Cardi B, could prove to be a powerful value unlock not contemplated in current estimates. We continue to value the business on a probability- weighted multi-year approach. For perspective, our $49 target price represents 27.5x EV/ EBITDA on our FY23E estimate of $88mn though does not contemplate option value of ~ CENTERFOLD success. ","What happened: PLBY Group issued a press release Thursday morning announcing the appointment of multi-talented global entertainment icon Cardi B as Creative Director in Residence, and Founding Creative Director of Playboy’s CENTERFOLD platform. Cardi will reportedly provide artistic direction for co-branded fashion merchandise, sexual wellness products, and other consumer-facing consumer branded experiences. The co-branded merchandise collections will be offered through PLBY Group’s global direct-to-consumer network. For the launch of the CENTERFOLD platform, planned for December 2021, Cardi B will serve as an ambassador and creative partner. Terms of the relationship between Cardi B and PLBY Group were not disclosed. Why It Matters: The Playboy brand’s association with Cardi B and her massive fan following is a terrific fit likely to be beneficial to both parties. Cardi B’s musical talents, outspoken public persona, and unapologetic sexual expression will help define the merchandising and social presence for the Playboy brand. Further, with her proven social media success, the partnership with Playboy on the creative direction of CENTERFOLD is validation of creator respect for the platform and appreciation of the business opportunity. We see the CENTERFOLD platform as a safe home for creators of both artistic content unacceptable to Instagram and as a non- pornographic alternative and OnlyFans. For creators, the platform provides multiple potential avenues to monetize their following base including revenue generation from subscriptions, gifting, tipping, paid direct messaging, paid virtual meetings, and sale of merchandise. CENTERFOLD will also reportedly support blockchain integration and issuance of NFTs for digital image protection and monetization. Underscoring the optionality for CENTERFOLD value, we note, OnlyFans has been rumored to seek investment at a $1bn+ valuation. CENTERFOLD has the benefit of a fresh start in defining the brand and platform, and is now aligned with Cardi B’s brand and 116mn Instagram followers; recall on the 3Q21 call, the founding creator team of CENTERFOLD was reported to have over 300mn social media followers, suggesting additional star power may be added in the near future. In the context of the stock, CENTERFOLD revenue is not included in the $600mn FY25 revenue target (+21% 4-year CAGR). This could prove to be a powerful value unlock if the platform achieves scale, generating flywheel momentum from growing users, benefiting the merchandising businesses, and contributing multiple-accretive sales growth. We continue to value the business on a probability-weighted multi-year approach, and our $49 target price represents 27.5x EV/EBITDA on our FY23E estimate of $88mn. Valuation: Our $49 12-month target price is based on the probability weighted fair value of business potential in five years discounted four years at appropriate market risk rates.

CENTERFOLD is foundational to integrating content creators, the consumer products business, and blockchain-enabled Web 3.0 concepts (NFT Rabbitars and a MetaMansion) to engage and reward consumers with real- life and digital products and experiences. Digital and Web 3.0 opportunities are not contemplated in targets for 2025E of $600mn in sales with 25%-30% EBITDA margins suggesting upside potential.

We continue to view a long-term perspective on valuation as appropriate and reaffirm our Buy rating and $49 target price. ","What happened: Stifel hosted PLBY Group CEO Ben Kohn and CFO Lance Barton for a series of virtual investor meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday. Investor questioning was focused on the digital future of the company and key areas of discussion included: 1) the brand reinvention and turnaround, 2) the forthcoming launch of the CENTERFOLD platform, 3) NFT launches and vision for the Web 3.0 space, 4) long-term drivers towards the $600mn 2025E target, 5) thought process around business models (licensing vs. ownership), and 6) management priorities. One of the world’s most recognizable brands, early stages of repositioning, resonating with a younger female demographic: PLBY Group is in the beginning stages of repositioning the globally recognized Playboy brand to better monetize merchandise sales (reportedly $3bn gross merchandise volume) and execute on digital opportunities. The brand has been reframed for the modern consumer — distancing itself from the magazine and association with Hugh Hefner’s legacy. Shifting the brand to a woman’s perspective (today, 80% of employees are women) is bringing early success in recruiting a younger and more diverse consumer base. For perspective, for the business on Playboy.com, half of the consumers are female, and 75% of customers are under the age of 34. High-growth consumer products business is the current foundation of brand monetization: Today, the foundation of the business is the consumer products business, focused on the streetwear, lingerie, beauty and grooming, and sexual wellness markets. The combined Licensing and Direct-to-Consumer businesses account for 90% of 2021E revenue including the pro forma contribution of the Australian lingerie brand, Honey Birdette, which was acquired in August (see note). Honey Birdette accelerated Playboy’s position in the high margin lingerie category and the brand’s design and sourcing competencies. In-combination with the reach of the Playboy brand, Honey Birdette holds promise for revenue and cost synergies including the pending launch of Playboy lingerie. Recall, the $600mn 2025E revenue target assumes a +HSD 4-year revenue CAGR from the Licensing business, and 20%+ 4-year revenue CAGR for the Direct-to-Consumer business including Honey Birdette (~1/3 of DTC revenue, has been growing at approximately 40%). Highly anticipated CENTERFOLD launch introduces advantages over creator-led platform alternatives: The CENTERFOLD launch date is set for later in December and signifies PLBY’s entrance to the $100bn creator economy. The launch will leverage 24 founding partner content creators with a social following of 300mn+.

POST US,POST,Dec 05 2021 08:20PM,"Post Holdings, Inc.",Food,Demystifying Post Holdings - A Path to Significant Value Creation ,"Post Holdings trades at a significant discount valuation in relation to its peers andespecially for a business poised to grow solidly over the next year. With a valuation standing near 9x EBITDA excluding the BellRing business, and roughly 25% below its food peers, we see strong upside for the shares. Post management has been aggressive with its capital and its portfolio - committing nearly $10 billion for acquisitions and $2 billion for share repurchase activity in the past eight years while creating significant value for shareholders through the IPO of BellRing, the sale of a stake in sth Avenue, and now the full distribution of its BellRing shares. We believe there could be more to come. Post will push down to 5x debt/ EBITDA following this transaction providing signification optionality for the business. We believe the valuation is compelling and provides strong upside from this level. ","An investment in Post Holdings today at $97 results in a 10.3x EBITDA multiple for the entire business including the BellRing stake. BellRing is valued at roughly $33 per Post share resulting in a value of $63 for base Post. On this basis, Post is trading at just 9x EBITDA, well below its peers and well below a reasonable sum-of-the-parts model. In assessing its valuation against its food peers with similar growth profiles, Post trades at a 25% discount to those peers, and we estimate a 35% discount based on a reasonable sum-of-the-parts model. So, what gives? We believe its leverage, the perceived commodity orientation of its Foodservice division, and a “conglomerate” discount all weigh on its valuation. Post management has shown a willingness and desire to alter the portfolio in order to take advantage of a mispricing of an asset in its portfolio and we believe it will do so with its foodservice egg business, if necessary. We also believe this business has the potential to show its real strengths — contracted pricing, greater than 50% market share, key restaurant partners, and volume growth potential. The BellRing distribution represents the culmination of Post’s successful ownership of this business — a $700 million investment 6-7 years ago led to a business valued at $4.4 billion prior to the announced distribution. We outline our distribution model below — we believe Post will spinoff, split-off, and swap its BellRing shares for debt leading to an improved balance sheet, upwards of 15% less shares, and significant value for its shareholders. BellRing’s business outlook remains robust. While it is battling a shortage of supply, the underlying consumption trends remain in strong shape as evidenced in its recent fourth quarter earnings report. Sure, shipments were short of consumption, but consumption is what matters and BellRing is winning. We believe its outlook for growth remains strong (double-digit sales and EBITDA growth) and will improve each quarter in FY22. We believe the company will continue to manage this portfolio with the shareholder in mind pursuing valued added M&A, repurchasing shares, and taking advantage of dislocations in value when they arise. But, something is getting lost in translation here as the Post shares continue to lag its peers and maintain a discount multiple. We thereby continue with our Buy rating and $125 target price.",Christopher R. Growe,"Christopher R. Growe;Matthew E. Smith, CFA;Bradley J.

PTC US,PTC,Dec 15 2021 06:25PM,PTC Inc.,Enterprise Software,"Strategy in Place, It's Execution Time! ","Earlier today (12/15), PTC held an upbeat and cohesive analyst day, where the companyhighlighted its differentiated and vertically-integrated stack, accelerating SaaSification efforts and associated GTM/restructuring changes, and further detailed its existing medium-term ambitions (mid-teens ARR growth [spanning 11%-17% Y/Y-CC] and 25%-30% FCF growth), including $700M-$750M in Adjusted FCF in FY24. Simply put, there has been a lot of noise in the system surrounding the name in recent months. That said, we continue to believe PTC has a solid product portfolio (loT/AR/CAD/PLM) and that the push to accelerate to SaaS is the right move as the industry continues to digitally transform. Net/net, it is all about solid execution and consistent messaging from here, and should that occur, we think PTC can deliver at-least low double-digit ARR growth and operating margin/ FCF expansion in coming years, and that shares can see multiple expansion as this plays out. ","Bottom line up front. Overall, PTC's end-markets continue to digitally transform to improve agility, reduce time to market, and decrease costs. With this, we support PTC's vertically- integrated stack combining loT, AR, CAD, and PLM along with the dual product strategy of cloud- native CAD/PLM at the low-end of the market while SaaSifying its existing portfolio to serve the upper-end of the market. This will be a multi-year journey, but accelerating the push to SaaS (both R&D and GTM alignment) makes sense ata high level. With all these moving parts, the key will be for PTC to deliver consistent execution AND consistent messaging, which we think can help lead to multiple expansion and the ability for the company to hit its medium-term targets. LT Model: Management reaffirmed its commentary from earnings around mid-teens ARR growth and 25%-30% FCF growth Mid-teens ARR growth has a range of 11%-17%, with a midpoint of 14%, underpinned by: Digital Thread Core - 10%-15% CAGR Digital Thread Growth - 20%-30% CAGR Digital Threat FSG - 0%-5% CAGR Velocity - 20%-30% CAGR On the margin front, management believes that margin expansion is a function of: 1) organizational optimization from the previously-announced restructuring plan and 2) scaling of existing sub-scale businesses. For example, while Arena is profitable, loT is not yet profitable but is nearing profitability, AR is not profitable, and Onshape is not profitable either (Onshape is at maximum burn rate now, with improvements expected in FY23) Capital allocation priorities remain 1) organic growth (S&M, R&D, SaaS), 2) M&A (targeted acquisitions), and 3) capital return Addressable Market: CAD: $5.4B market and expected to grow at a 7% 3-year CAGR (PTC has 11% share).

RCKT US,RCKT,Dec 14 2021 01:40PM,"Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",Biotechnology,"Analyst Day Takeaways: Backed By Strong Data, Insight On Strategy Substantiates Our Enthusiasm In LV Portfolio ","We previously shared our thoughts on the American Society of Hematology (ASH)presentations, but insights from the Analyst day reinforce our optimism that RP-L102 (Fanconi anemia [FA]) and RP-L201 (leukocyte adhesion deficiency-| [LAD-I]) are on strong footing with management's careful and strategic planning striking us as preemptively checking the right boxes. In an environment where regulatory uncertainties are compounded by unexpected hiccups - particularly in gene therapy - we believe tactical investments early-on place RCKT at an advantageous position as BLA/MAA submissions for FA and/or LAD-I emerge on the horizon. No exact guidance was provided today, but with enrollment either complete (LAD-I) or approaching it (FA), clearer guideposts may be provided in 2022; maintaining our US launch assumptions in 2023E-2024E bearing in mind LAD-I may cross the finish line sooner (vs. FA). Reiterate Buy, $63 TP. ","FA: 11th patient dosed, one step closer to study's goals. Recall, efficacy in 5 out of 12 patients over a 1-3 year period post-treatment is required to reject the null hypothesis and that 6 out of 10 patients have already met these criteria as of ASH data (LINK). Today, we learned that patient 11 had been dosed bringing us one step closer to the 12 patient denominator. Seeing as how treated patients need to show =>10% mitomycin-C (MMC) resistance above baseline at two time points (~12 months + confirmatory), we think RCKT is on its way to meeting this endpoint. Lastly, whereas patient identification efforts are a key driver behind a successful commercial launch, commentary on ~2K already identified (of ~4K estimated FA) may engender a steeper uptake curve, should RP-L102 be approved. LAD-I: pursuing full approval is strategic on multiple fronts. RP-L201 (n=9, enrollment complete) continues to show a clean safety profile and durable CD18 levels. Today's added color around the regulatory strategy include pursuing a full approval based on survival (in addition to CD18 benefit) rather than accelerated approval. While this slightly alters the overall duration of the trial (i.e., ~6 months), management believes that the resulting data package delivers a more compelling argument in favor of the drug that may result in a broader label and better patient access/reimbursement. PKD: laser-focused on completing Ph.1 in severe adult and pediatric patients before moving into a pivotal study; already contemplating life cycle management. In addition to ASH data recap showing durable and favorable responses in hemoglobin (Hb) along with positive trends in other hematologic parameters (LINK), management reminded us that patient 1002 had previously failed mitapivat (AGIO, not covered) - a small molecule activator of PKR, which is an isoform of pyruvate kinase. Ph.1 does not exclude patients based on prior treatment experience and this inclusion/exclusion criteria may shed some angles of differentiation between RP-L301 and other investigational agents. With the expectation that earlier intervention may engender greater degree of benefit, we are intrigued by the pediatric cohort (n=2-3). To that end, regulatory discussions are in progress to accelerate opening the trial for pediatrics. Whereas we think opening a compassionate use program may provide earlier access to patients concurrently strengthening the clinical profile of RP-L301, we appreciate RCKT's unwavering determination towards execution, enrolling such patients in their pivotal trial instead. Optimistic on RCKT's regulatory preparedness. We admit chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) are difficult to vet and represent a key regulatory uncertainty. That said, we believe early activities and investments bode well as FA and LAD-I programs edge towards BLA/ MAA submission milestone.

RETA US,RETA,Dec 09 2021 05:48AM,"Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",Biotechnology,"Bard Potential Across Indications in Question Following 0-13 Panel, Lower TP to $75 ","Unanimously and telegraphed in the FDA briefing documents, the AdCom panel voted 0-13against approval of Bardoxolone for Alport Syndrome, despite the severe unmet need in this rapidly progressing orphan disease—setting the stage for a CRL on 2/25/22. While CARDINAL achieved its primary/secondary endpoints, the panel could not get past study design flaws that prevented differentiating pharmacodynamic artifact from true impact on kidney disease progression as measured by the eGFR surrogate. We doubt this could be reconciled ahead of the PDUFA. While the panel encouraged continued exploration, it is not clear what avenue RETA will pursue at this time. Bard is being studied in ADPKD (FALCON Ph.3) and rapidly- progressing CKD (MERLIN, Ph.2), each of which we look at skeptically given similar designs. With Bard having accounted for majority value, we now lower the TP to $75 ascribing value to high-risk Omav/FA, low-probability Bard + residual cash. ","Discussion panel concluded benefits do not outweigh risks, citing multiple efficacy and safety concerns: The committee’s primary efficacy concern revolved around CARDINAL’s 4- week washout periods and whether they provided sufficient time to tease out reversible PD effects of Bard and expose potential underlying disease-modifying effects. The panel believed that a primary endpoint of off-treatment eGFR change, as well as accompanying measurements of other key kidney function-indicating biomarkers (like additional creatinine measurements or cystatin C), would have been more clinically meaningful in determining residual improvement in kidney function—resolving the washout debate. Despite Alport being a rare disease, the committee felt the trial was too small at only 157 patients (especially given discontinuation rates), had missing data from COVID-related challenges in testing, and excluded 25 patients from Year 2 analysis, potentially presenting bias. Other key efficacy critiques included the lack of enrichment in adolescent patients, who had greater potential for more pronounced improvement, and inadequate analyses accounting for patient genotype, given that certain subpopulations (namely, male X-linked and homozygous recessive) had a far higher risk of ESRD progression. Safety concerns expressed by the committee notably highlighted acute eGFR impacts, elevated albuminuria (a risk factor for ESRD and CV disease) and trends toward BNP/NT-proBNP levels. Weight loss seen in pediatric Bard patients raised concern on whether treatment would impact growth and development during a critical adolescent maturing period, especially given the small subgroup size of 11-12 patients per arm. Bard patients presented with higher albuminuria (associated with ESRD, CV) by means of an unknown mechanism as well as increased BNP/ NT-proBNP (biomarkers of CVD) serum levels, even with an exclusion criteria of BNP >200pg/ mL for CARDINAL. BNP/NT-proBNP levels are typically inversely related to eGFR rates and should increase with declining eGFR. Instead, the contrary was observed with increased BNP/ NT-proBNP levels despite increased eGFR, bringing less transparency to Bard’s safety. The likelihood of RETA reconciling these issues ahead of the 2/25/21 PDUFA are low and we think discussions with FDA will now revolve around next steps forward for Alport, which are unclear at this point. We think all of these issues will likely carry over into any other indications RETA explores, putting the entire program into question. Bard is knocked down, but additional programs offer possibility for salvage...and Omav: We acknowledge that Bard’s best opportunity for approval was in Alport Syndrome, which is now highly unlikely. With no approved treatments in a fast-progressing and devastating disease, the threshold to surpass for risk/reward was lower than the other CKD indications like ADPKD and other rapidly progressing CKD. The fate of this review cycle is all but sealed with a unanimous “no” vote, on top of the FDA's already negative view of the submission.

RNLX US,RNLX,Dec 07 2021 03:31PM,Renalytix Plc,Life Sciences & Diagnostics,"KidneylntelX Ramp Inches Forward, Business Development Target Looks Encouraging ","RNLX started fiscal 2022 on a familiar ground, as the company continues to work on rampingup the KidneylntelX testing launch at Mt.Sinai, while getting going at Wake Forest and setting the stage for a mid-year launch at Univ of Utah and St. Joseph's. Looking ahead, business development activity in 2022 looks as though it should keep its brisk pace: while the way in which the total will come together lacks clarity, management's target of 20 partners by the end of the calendar year is encouraging. As we push through the year, the focus will be on FDA approval (calendar 2H22 is now our current expectation), reimbursement (expected mid-calendar 22), and the way in which true volume acceleration can materialize during the second half of the year. RNLX remains a low-visibility, but high potential Dx story that should continue to draw interest as slow-but-steady commercial progress is made. ","F1Q22 Results. Renalytix reported F1Q revenue of $0.5M, below our $0.9M estimate and the Street's $2.2M estimate (2 estimates). $0.45M of revenue came from testing at Mount Sinai, and $30,000 was related to the AstraZeneca partnership. Adjusted R&D expense was $3.8M, above our $3.0 estimate, while Adjusted SG&A expense was $7.3M, below our $8.0M estimate. GAAP EPS was ($0.14), just below the Street's ($0.13) estimate and above our ($0.15) estimate. Test Volume Still Low, Moving Towards Target. KidneylntelX cumulative volumes were noted as being in the thousands, which suggests Mount Sinai is still working toward ramping to 300 tests per week. Management believes, however, that 300 per week as an exit rate for CY4Q21 is doable, noting that the current ""conversion rate"" (the percent of tests that a doc actually runs once the population health portal suggests it) now sits at an encouraging 80%. Beyond Mt. Sinai, testing at Wake Forest appears to be ramping now, with Utah and St. Joe's looking as though they should see initial volumes in the middle of the calendar year. With Wake Forest/ Atrium initiating initial tests six months after the partnership was announced, the goal will be to reduce the time to implement down toward 3-4 months with coming partners. As such, we remain hopeful that, together with a testing ramp at the VA, this can yield a material acceleration in overall Kidneylntelx volumes in calendar 2H22. 14 New Partners Expected In CY22? With respect to business development, the outlook appears quite strong overall as we look to 2022. The flip side of this is that the specifics are pretty fuzzy. Management is targeting 20 partnerships by the end of the calendar year, which would be a robust increase from the 6 that exist today (Mt. Sinai, Wake Forest/Atrium, Utah, St. Joe's, CDPHP, & VA). The makeup and magnitude of incremental activity, however, is unclear. Several new deals will come from academic/hospital systems - but some of the partners will come from VA institutions. While this new VA activity would undoubtedly be a positive, the incremental contribution within our model is tough to call, since we currently assume a level of overall penetration within the ~1M patients eligible within the VA system. In the coming quarters, we expect management to provide some clarity on how new account formation might progress and how the testing opportunity might scale accordingly.

R US,R,Dec 13 2021 03:40PM,"Ryder System, Inc.","Trucking, Logistics & Truck Leasing",Ryder Builds on Supply Chain Business with Second Acquisition in Two Months; Main. Hold ,"This morning, Ryder announced it is acquiring Whiplash for $480m (1x 2022E sales) in cash.Whiplash is a leading provider of omnichannel fulfillment and logistics services and is expected to add around $480m to 2022 sales. While no transaction multiple (outside of the implied EV/ sales multiple) was provided, management said this is inline with its ""strategy to accelerate growth in our higher-return supply chain business"" so we could imply an operating margin profile of at least high-single-digits. At an 8% margin, the EV/EBIT multiple would be 12.5x up to a 10% margin where it would be 10x - with Ryder trading just above 13x next year's EBIT, there could be a slight degree of multiple arbitrage over time if successfully integrated. Overall, we view the deal positively given our belief that the multiple expansion story for Ryder relies on SCS growth. ","Transaction Further Builds Out eCommerce Capabilities: Ryder's acquisition of Whiplash continues its fortification of the SCS business line and increases exposure to eCommerce. We see synergies as likely over time and believe Ryder will be able to invest in the business to add increased scalability. Whiplash brings to Ryder a larger footprint near west and east coast ports, increases warehousing space by just under 7m square feet (~+10%) and adds up to 250 brands (a lot of smaller brands but also larger buyers like H&M and Ross). Consolidation in retail-oriented logistics offerings is likely to continue and Ryder should be a net beneficiary as the company increases touch points and technology integration. Updating Estimates, Target Price to $92: We raise our 2022 and 2023 revenue and EPS estimates to account for the acquisition. We lift our target price to $92, which is based on shares trading at ~10.5x 2022E EPS, as we see this deal as a step in the right direction for Ryder. The supply chain business should be an area with less volatility and potentially higher long-term returns on capital, and management appears to be signaling that they are focused on expediting that process. To the extent that Ryder can show improvement in its SCS and DTS margin profile following a challenging 3Q, we would become more bullish on multiple expansion from here, all else equal.",Bert W.

Better than expected revenue growth was in-part driven by higher average client spend as active customer growth was below expectations. Strength was seen in Women's, Kid's, Freestyle and the U.K.; U.K. revenue doubled y/y. The company noted that growth in the Men's business has been slower to recover, but is showing promising results with Freestyle adoption, specifically within the shoes and denim categories. Gross margin improved +220bps y/y to 47%, ahead of our expectation for a +165bp y/y increase, due to stronger merchandise margins and shipping cost optimization. Marketing spend as a percentage of revenue increased +270bps sequentially to 8.7% of sales, mainly due to the launch of Freestyle, though was below our 9.5% expectation as the company limited spend as it works to optimize its new onboarding experience. F2Q:22 and full year revenue guidance well below expectations. Stitch Fix guided F2Q:22 revenue to $505-$520mm (+1.5% y/y growth at the midpoint), well below our prior in-line $592mm (+17% y/y) estimate. The reduced revenue outlook stems from lower expected net customer adds and the impact from supply chain challenges which has resulted in delays in inventory receipts of up to 1-4 weeks. As the company has fully rolled out its Freestyle product to new customers, it has worked to optimize its new client acquisition and onboarding which has impacted Fix conversion rates.

SNOW US,SNOW,Dec 01 2021 09:57PM,Snowflake Inc.,Enterprise Software,Redefining Growth At Scale...F3Q22 Results Far Ahead Of Expectations ,"After the close on 12/1, Snowflake reported F3Q22 results that exceeded consensusexpectations across all major financial metrics. The highlight of the quarter was Snowflake's outsized, $28M, revenue beat and first quarter of positive Non-GAAP operating income driven by large customer momentum as NRRR of 173% reflected a second consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. That said, we believe there is a sizeable opportunity for significant revenue growth to continue as these customers further ramp their consumption of the SNOW data platform. Net/net, Snowflake's disruptive consumption based data-platform and pricing model, coupled with workload secular-growth, should generate sizable new logos gains and strong up-sell/ cross-sell activity, yielding 50%+ top-line growth in coming years. Given recent success and growth opportunities, we expect Snowflake to remain in investment mode for the foreseeable future, although we believe there is ample leverage in the model over time.

SONX US,SONX,Dec 09 2021 07:49PM,"Sonendo, Inc.",Medical Technology & Supplies,3Q21 Results: A Clean Start as a Public Company; Reiterate Buy ,"With Sonendo flashing 3Q21 results in the S-1, there were not many financial surprises specificto the quarter, but a few items help strengthen our conviction that things are starting off on the right foot. Revenue of $7.9MM basically matched our $7.8MME, and initial 2021 guidance ($32-32.5MM) allows us to modestly walk-up 4Q21 estimates. Gross margin of 26.0% in 3Q21 was at the high-end of the preliminary range (24-27%) and above our 24.6%E. COVID/Omicron: management noted that COVID flare-ups are not currently acting as a headwind to procedure volumes. Inventory/Supply Chain: appears intact. Finally, the commercial organization ramp-up is running above our early expectations (capital and consumable) — we view this as the biggest positive as our prior diligence (among 35 GentleWave adopters) highlighted the favorable attributes of the system (superior clinical outcomes, greater efficiency, improved profitability), and the increased salesforce may enable Sonendo to accelerate momentum throughout 2022. ","3Q21 Results. Sonendo turned in a solid yet unsurprising quarter given preliminary 3Q21 results were conveyed in the company’s S-1. Total revenue of $7.9MM grew +29% y/y and +14% versus 3Q19. Procedure Instrument (Pl) revenue was $3.7MM in the quarter, representing growth of +30% and +37.5% compared to 3Q20 and 3Q19, respectively. Console revenue of $1.8MM grew +44% y/y and we estimate the company sold 29 systems in the quarter. Gross margin — which we view as a key element of the Sonendo story moving forward — finished at 26% in the quarter, up ~640 bps y/y and aided by a good performance from the high-margin (60%+) Software business. We estimate adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was -$10.0MM as the company leans in on strategic investment priorities including expanding their commercialization efforts, continued product innovation and preparing for the broad CleanFlow rollout over the course of 2022. Guidance. Sonendo issued 2021 revenue guidance of $32.0MM to $32.5MM (+38% y/y at the midpoint) versus our prior estimate of $32.0MM, implying 4Q21 revenue of $8.9MM compared to our prior $8.8MM. In addition, gross margins are expected to “inch up” in 4Q21 (26% in 3Q21), aided by higher revenue. As we highlight above, the company's commercial organization ramp- up is trending well, and management expects to have 17 consumable reps and 24 capital sales reps by year-end (versus 23 capital today and 16 as of the end of 2Q21). Our 2022 and 2023 revenue estimates of $40.2MM (+25% y/y) and $57.5MM (+43% y/y) remain largely unchanged. Stifel Investment Thesis. While a good amount of work lies ahead for Sonendo, we believe GentleWave possesses many similar qualities to other select dental technologies that were able to successfully shake up their respective part of the industry (e.g., Invisalign in orthodontics). Our robust survey diligence of 35 GentleWave practices was bullish and supports our positive view of the story — future incremental system purchases appear likely, increased utilization was encouraging, GentleWave clearly drives improved practice efficiency/profitability, and user satisfaction was very high. With the story still in the fairly early stages, execution will be crucial on number of fronts, notably around gross margin expansion (currently well below peers), sales force expansion/bifurcation, innovation (CleanFlow PI and obturation/cavities longer-term), and market expansion (GPs and international). With the stock trading at 4.5x our 2023 revenue estimate of $57.5MM (2.8x our 2024 estimate), we reiterate our Buy rating on what we view as one of the next true dental disruptors still in the early innings.",Jonathan D.

Given the in-line performance and Cloud underperformance, we do not believe that the business is meaningfully accelerating, and coupled with the recent CEO change, believe that CY22/ FY23 will stand as another transition year for the company. Net/net, while we continue to believe there is a solid opportunity in front of the company as it transitions its existing legacy on-prem customers to Splunk's new workload-based pricing model, we believe the company's Cloud solution needs to be optimized and remain concerned that net new workload wins remain elusive.

STOR US,STOR,Dec 07 2021 08:10PM,STORE Capital Corporation,Triple-Net REITs,Takeaways From Meeting With STOR Management ,"Today we met with the CEO and President of STORE Capital Corporation, Mary Fedewa, andthe recently appointed CFO and Treasurer, Sherry Rexroad. This is the first in-person meeting that we have had with management since Mary became CEO and Sherry became CFO. It gave management an opportunity to lay out their vision for where the company is going and put their imprint on the company. ","Building Out Data Warehouse. The team has been focused on building out a data warehouse and implementing increased use of data analytics in the company's day-to- day operations. Management feels this will assist them in their acquisition, disposition, and portfolio management activity. Constantly Searching For Middle-Market Relationships. STOR continues to maintain a deep list of target companies with whom they hope to build relationships. STOR views these relationships as pivotal to their strategy in that the company becomes tenants' go-to for transactions. Management remains focused on the company's credit underwriting process and seeking middle-market profit center real estate acquisition opportunities. Portfolio Cap Rates Have Compressed More. During our meeting, management noted that they have seen some compression of cap rates, particularly regarding portfolio transactions, they haven't seen the same degree of compression in STOR's target acquisitions. Management feels that they have reached the size to engage in larger portfolio transactions, and could ultimately use their smaller middle-market acquisitions to offset potentially lower portfolio transaction cap rates. On Track For ~5.0% Internal Growth Again. Management feels that built-in lease escalators aren't necessarily given the deserved credit by investors. STOR has negotiated these escalators in their lease agreements that should help bolster internal growth, which management can supplement with external growth. Management is encouraged by the impact of higher inflation triggering CPl-based escalators within their lease agreements. To that point, of the 9.3% guided 2022 growth, ~5% is driven from internal growth. STOR Bonds Spreads At Historical Lows. In October, S&P Global Ratings raised its outlook for STOR from stable to positive and affirmed the company's BBB issuer credit rating. The improved outlook has benefited STOR, as seen in their recent bond offering. To that point, management noted that spreads are some of the best they've ever been. Recently Priced Attractive Bond, Prepaid Some Master Funding Outstanding.On November 9, the company announced that they had priced $375 million of 2.70% senior notes due 2031. STOR intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to pay down its revolving credit facility and its STOR Master Funding Series 2013-3 Class A-2 notes, along with acquisitions and general corporate purposes.",Simon Yarmak,"Simon Yarmak, CFA;Connor Shockley, CFA",39.25,,Buy,-,USD,,,,,,,,,,,,STIFEL_STOR_CoNote_2021-12-07.pdf,STOR_CoNote_2021-12-07,,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=797396c9-8740-463b-bc5c-19fefd551ffa&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
SUN US,SUN,Dec 08 2021 04:37PM,Sunoco LP,Energy Infrastructure,SUN 2022 Outlook: Investor Day ,"We recently attended Sunoco's 2022 Analyst Day in New York. The partnership is optimisticabout the future of the midstream industry and refined products’ place in it. While the country makes its way into electric vehicles, Sunoco stands firm in their view that it will be a slow transition, giving the firm time to grow its current operations as well as transitioning operations, to eventually include the transportation of alternative fuel sources. We have a positive view of Sunoco's ability to generate cash flows for years to come. All that said, we are tweaking our estimates lower and adjusting our price target to $44.00 from $45.00. ","Macro Outlook Sunoco (SUN) believes consumers will continue to transition to electric vehicles (EVs) at some point in the future, however, the rate of adoption is up for much debate. While there is wide variation in the estimates as to the pace of the EV transition, even in a high EV growth scenario, SUN believes it will be decades before a majority of Americans are driving EVs. Given this outlook, SUN is poised to grow revenues and drive positive free cash flows. Diversified Growth Strategy SUN expects to grow both organically and through M&A opportunities in 2022. While this may happen in both their distribution and midstream divisions, SUN’s capex budget remains more dedicated to fuel distribution. Internally, SUN expects growth to be attributable to its gasoline brands, as well as the reliability of its service to retail gas stations both of which they view as competitive advantages. While we agree that a certain amount of organic growth is achievable we remain cautious regarding M&A for terminals, as there is a finite set and SUN is already a dominant player. 2022 Guidance and Outlook Management expects volumes to increase 5% mainly due to an increase in invested capital as well as the recent acquisition of terminals from NuStar Energy L.P. (NS). Margins are expected to remain stable throughout 2022. Lastly, SUN believes higher expenses are on the way due to an uptick in inflation, as well as the partnership possessing a larger asset base throughout 2022. Overall, we are modeling EBITDA to increase 3% in 2022. We anticipate SUN will invest $150 million in growth projects presuming they find the right opportunities. Valuation SUN trades at 8.9x to our 2022 LP EBITDA estimate of $708 million. We apply a 9.5x multiple to develop our $44.00 TP.

TALO US,TALO,Dec 21 2021 10:59AM,Talos Energy Inc.,Oil & Gas Exploration and Production,"Successful Borrowing Base Redetermination, Updating Estimates ","This morning, TALO announced that the semi annual redetermination of its borrowing baseresulted in an increase in elected commitments to $792MM from $730MM and increased flexibility relating to its CCS business.We are also updating our 2022 estimates based on management commentary from its 3Q21 conference call on November 7, 2021. ","Updating Estimates We are raising our 2022 EBITDA estimate 10% to $736MM based on a lower operating expense and timing, partially offset by a slightly lower production forecast. We are raising our 2022 capex estimate 16% to $480MM assuming the company reinvests 65% of its EBITDA, in line with guidance of 60%-65%. We are adjusting our 2022 production estimate to reflect restoration of storm-related outages, new volumes from the Pompano platform, and the impact of the required mid-year dry dock of the Helix Floating Production Unit (HP-1). Approximately 4 MBoepd of outages are expected to be placed back online by YE21. Early success with the Pompano platform rig program is also expected to add 1.5-2.0 MBoepd by YE21. The regularly scheduled maintenance of the HP-1 (every 2.5-3 years) will result in 45-60 days of total shut-in of the Phoenix Complex in Green Canyon Block 237 during 2Q22 and 3Q22. As a result, we are raising our 1Q22 production estimate 2% to 68 MBoepd and lowering our 2Q22/3Q22/4Q22 estimates 2%/2%/5% to 62/61/63 MBoepd. Our updated 2022 estimate of 63 MBoepd is 1% below our prior estimate and 1% below Street consensus. Borrowing Base Before today's open, TALO announced the completion of its semi-annual RBL redetermination process. The borrowing base was reaffirmed at $950MM and total commitments increased 8% to $792MM from $730MM. Additionally, one new major lender was added to the RBL facility. We expect total liquidity to increase to $477MM at YE21 from $366MM at YE20 and $376MM at 9/30/21. TALO also announced that the redetermination process resulted in provisions increasing financing flexibility relating to its early-stage CCS projects.

TENB US,TENB,Dec 15 2021 08:07PM,"Tenable Holdings, Inc.",Enterprise Software,"Setting A Floor, Not A Ceiling...20% PLUS Growth Into 2025 ","On 12/15, Tenable hosted its first analyst day, where they discussed strategic initiatives, GTMmotions, and updates to their long-term operating model. The highlight of the meeting was management's commitment to AT LEAST 20% growth and a Rule of 50 in the coming years, generating $1B of CCB in 2024 and over $1B of revenue in 2025. We view these targets as very realistic and would not be surprised to see TENB reach these targets 6-12 months earlier than anticipated. Revenue growth should clearly be driven by new customer acquisition and ARPU gains within the installed base due to the ever evolving threat landscape, look no further than the Log4j vulnerability, customer's continuously expanding attack surfaces stemming from growing Cloud/loT adoption, and TENB's growing product set (AD, Cloud, OT products). On the opex- front management reaffirmed its commitment to profitable-growth on the heels of go-to-market leverage (higher salesforce productivity and partnerships). ","The Path to $1B. Overall, the highlight of the analyst day was management's long-term operating model update, in which they provided a path to a 20% + CAGR and $1.1B of revenue by FY25. Management explicitly noted that the 20% + CAGR only includes organic growth but that M&A will remain a part of its go-forward strategy, providing additional upside to expectations. Consistent with recent commentary, management highlighted that its non- traditional VM and exposure solutions, that currently represent 40% of CCB (vs. 60% for the traditional VM solutions) are generating 50% y/y CCB growth, compared to the 10% y/y growth for the traditional VM solutions, and thus will account for the majority of future CCB gains. Management also provided a LT margin update that points to increasing levels of profitability and FCF as the company expects to generate additional S&M and G&A leverage, compared to previous forecasts, in coming years.

TER US,TER,Dec 20 2021 01:19AM,"Teradyne, Incorporated",Semiconductor Capital Equipment,"Automation is compelling, Teradyne’s runway is long, and the Story is far from written ","Late last, week we hosted some investor meetings with Teradyne’s President of the IndustrialAutomation Group Greg Smith and VP of Corporate Communications Andy Blanchard. Discussion centered mainly around the automation business, which is experiencing a strong rebound this year and at current visibility appears poised for further strength moving through 2022 and beyond. Supply chain constraints will likely pose some level of headwind through at least mid-year next year, but we continue to expect high growth for the segment in 2022 at least in line with Teradyne’s +20-35% midterm target. Based on our added conviction in the automation growth strategy and outlook (which in our view benefits from its residency within broader Teradyne), we believe this remains an under-owned/appreciated part of the story. ","Labor scarcity a driving force (and still early days). A recurring theme in the meetings was the degree by which labor constraints are driving companies to automate. In prior notes we have highlighted labor scarcity as a key demand driver for collaborative robot (including fixed and mobile) solutions, and how in the U.S. there is a significant shortfall in the relevant manufacturing and transportation/logistics markets. Teradyne has taken this one step further, and based on its own internal analysis sees a potential TAM of roughly 16 million collaborative robots. Taken in context, to date the industry as a whole has shipped well shy of 300k collaborative robots, for <2% market penetration rate. Easy to use, easy to choose. Teradyne’s automation footprint is rooted in its 2015 acquisition of Universal Robots (UR). And while the company has also expanded into the autonomous mobile robot (AMR) market, UR (having grown 7x since then) still represents ~80% of industrial automation sales. Given the under-penetrated market opportunity, new customer acquisition remains a key focus, and we believe Teradyne’s 1) vast network of distributor/integrator partners, and 2) increasingly solution-based approach to selling robots, are two key competitive advantages. Teradyne cited the example of welding applications (now 10% of UR sales, but an insignificant contributor entering the pandemic), where through its ecosystem partners automated work cells for welding applications are built around its UR robot. We are not aware of any competitors that have come close to replicating the ease of implementation created by these solutions. Gears to go still on Teradyne’s strategic roadmap. We believe the company is increasingly focused on unlocking new product/revenue synergies across its automation business. For starters, Teradyne is building a more robust fleet management platform capable of controlling both its MiR and AutoGuide (heavy payload lift-trucks) AMRs, as robot interoperability remains key customer challenge. AutoGuide is a relatively nascent revenue stream today, yet is a direct path towards addressing the burgeoning warehouse/ogistics automation market, and at its higher ASP point in our view could quickly become a meaningful contributor by 2023. We believe Teradyne is also poised to begin capitalizing on its leading ~60k installed base of UR robots, by offering new subscription-based recurring revenue services to customers next year for remote monitoring and diagnostics. There will likely be opportunities to broaden the offering (data analytics, predictive maintenance...) over time, with aspirations for recurring value-add services to eventually comprise a much higher ratio of robot sales (perhaps upwards of 20-25%). Though still far from the finished article and at times overshadowed by test, we believe an automation business poised to sustain +20-35% growth warrants more attention in its own right.",Brian Chin,"Brian Chin, CFA;Patrick J.

To us, most of the updates — while positive — were largely expected and don't change our view that the market is going to become much more competitive in 2022+. Incremental updates: (1) a patch pump that could reach the market in 5-years; (2) 2022 sales guidance that captures current consensus; (3) 1MM patients by 2027 (300K today), driven in part by 65% US T1 penetration (from mid-30s). Of all the updates, this one struck us as most ambitious given that our diligence suggests T1 penetration will potentially “max out” at 65-70% due to cost, technology/aversion, etc.; (4) expectation of multiple hardware platforms — perhaps three by 2027. Clearly, TNDM is confident that this is the avenue to push pump penetration higher, but we had envisioned more software enhancements, rather than hardware, in the pipeline. TNDM Hold, $122TP.

TNP US,TNP,Dec 16 2021 06:03PM,Tsakos Energy Navigation Ltd.,Maritime,Tsakos Takes Advantage of a Soft Market but at the Cost of a Ballooning Share Count ,"Tsakos has historically been a counter-cyclical investor and also mitigates short-term volatilityrisk by ordering vessels against medium-term time charters with oil majors. The company has made a number of orders recently that fit that mold, but with depressed cash flow, the company has been issuing a combination of common and preferred equity to strengthen the balance sheet. With respect to common sales, the impact is highly dilutive to upside, and we find it extremely challenging to justify the capex against such a high cost of equity. Ultimately, we do expect the tanker market to recover, but as the share count rises, the potential upside falls, and we are keeping a Hold rating on the shares. ","Utilization hit 3Q. In one of the weakest tanker markets in history, Tsakos preemptively brought forward maintenance on a number of vessels resulting in utilization of only 90% and a substantial revenue miss. This should help future utilization levels during a time of hopefully better earnings. Thus far in 4Q, rates have improved, particularly for some of the smaller product tankers, but are still lower than had been previously modeled and well below breakeven levels. Busier than an ATM on the Strip in Vegas. During the third quarter, Tsakos issued $14.4 million of common and preferred equity under the ATM program, and then drew down an additional $31.9 million quarter-to-date in 4Q. Along the way, it became necessary to add $100 million to approved capacity. Management indicated that most of the activity was on the preferreds, with only $15 million of the total being coming equity. There is about $85 million left outstanding, and we expect the company will likely remain very busy. We are modeling nearly all of the remaining capacity should be used by the end of next year and entirely on preferred equity, which is trading close to par and clearly cheaper on a relative basis. However, as was the case in October when TNP shares popped above $11, we expect the company is likely to be opportunistic and quickly move to common. In our view, potential selling pressure may keep the shares below $10 until any such pressure abates. What to do with the money. First, Tsakos has more than $200 million per year of debt repayment obligations along with about $90 million of interest and preferred dividends. Based on our spot rates assumptions for next year, that accounts for almost the entire EBITDA balance. However, the company also has $480 million of capex commitments in the next two years, and sounds to be in the market for more should contracts materialize. There is certainly capacity to finance much of the capex balance and refinancing some existing debt, but more equity would help and the company has not been shy about raising it. Valuation. Shares are cheap relative to NAV, but TNP shares have almost always traded at large discount to peers and NAV. While we do expect market conditions to improve and consequently shares are only trading at 6x '22 EBITDA, with the potential overhang of more equity issuance, aside from a major cyclical improvement in rates, we expect there is likely to be a ceiling on the TNP share price, and we are maintaining our Hold rating.",Benjamin J.

TTI US,TTI,Dec 21 2021 05:35PM,"TETRA Technologies, Inc.",Oilfield Services & Equipment,Adding Some Color Around the Eos Agreement; Upside Potential Doesn't Appear to be Reflected in Stock ,"Last week, TETRA announced an agreement with Eos Energy that we discussed in a note titledAgreement with Eos Energy a Positive Step for TTI's Renewable Energy Portfolio; Reiterate Buy. Although terms were not disclosed, in this note we summarize potential EBITDA contribution from the agreement which we do not believe is reflected in TETRA's stock price. We reiterate our Buy on TTI with a $5.00 target price. ","Overview of Agreement: TETRA announced a long-term supply contract with Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc. (EOSE: $8.44, NC), a leading provider of zinc-based long duration energy storage systems. Under the agreement, TTI agreed to support the manufacturing of Eos's innovative Znyth aqueous zinc battery solution with its PureFlow™ product. TTI's ability to produce high purity zinc-bromide with its PureFlow™ process makes it a key partner for Eos, which relies on high purity zinc bromide for its patented electrolyte long duration battery system. No Terms Disclosed: The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but using the following data points, we attempt to put some parameters around the upside for TETRA. The assumptions include: TETRA will be the primary supplier to Eos. e¢ Eos has a significant backlog of opportunity including $152 mm of booked orders (613MWh) and $3.7 bn (22GHw, according to recent Eos presentation) of opportunities. Eos expects manufacturing capacity to be 800+MWh by the end of 2022 versus 260MWh in 2021 and 65MWh in 2020. Consensus expectations are for Eos' revenue to rise from $5 million in 2021 to $84 million in 2022, to $264 million and $464 million in 2023 and 2024, respectively. ABack-of-the-Envelope Estimate: Using the above data points as a guide for growth rates, we believe TETRA could generate $20-30 million in 2023 revenue and around $50 million in 2024 as a result of this agreement. If we assume TETRA would deliver at least normal Fluids margins for its PureFlow™ sales, this equates to $15+ million of 2024 EBITDA potential and possibly double that in 2025. While the trajectory of Eos' orders and delivery are critical, this is arguably a reasonable starting point to ballpark the PureFlow™ opportunity without including contracts from other storage companies. A Strong Step to Our Targets: As part of our attempt to value TETRA's new energy initiatives, we have used a goal of $25-50 million in 2025 EBITDA from PureFlow™ for energy storage, its lithium reserves, and its calcium chloride applications for carbon capture. The arrangement with Eos is a strong step toward reaching these targets. Maintaining $5.00 Target Price and Buy Rating: Based on our sum-of-the-parts analysis, we believe TTI's legacy business is worth about $4.00 per share. We believe the low carbon initiatives could add $2-$6 of value to the shares, and the deal with Eos raises our confidence in this range. We are still only assigning 25% of the midpoint of that range to our target price, which supports our $5.00 target price.",Stephen Gengaro,Stephen Gengaro,5,,Buy,-,USD,0.18,,,,,,491.7,,,,,STIFEL_TTI_CoNote_2021-12-21.pdf,TTI_CoNote_2021-12-21,,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=617bc383-5309-48cc-a783-f8bd2907c7a4&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

TXRH US,TXRH,Dec 15 2021 06:20PM,"Texas Roadhouse, Inc.",Restaurants & Franchised Businesses,TXRH: Takeaways from vNDR ,"Our View: We recently hosted a vNDR with CEO Jerry Morgan, CFO Tonya Robinson, andMichael Bailen, Sr. Director of IR and Financial Analysis. The company struck a confident tone about its ability to continue growing its top-line, and we were encouraged to learn about potential levers to support SRS momentum in 2022. The company is also exploring various options to increase productivity, including equipment upgrades in the kitchen and pay-at-the- table technology. However, TXRH is not immune to the inflationary pressures impacting the industry, and while management expressed confidence in the ability to achieve ROM in the 17-18% range, they cautioned recapturing that level would likely stretch into 2023. While we note beef inflation has moderated in recent weeks, we are hesitant to adjust annual EPS estimates pending greater certainty the trend will hold. ","Visitation trends remain steady. Our review of mobile location data indicates little change in visitation since the company provided a QTD update on its 10/28 earnings call. That said, Texas Roadhouse expects a 5.3% price impact this quarter (4% in Oct. and 5.9% in Nov/Dec), and steady visitation coupled with increased check averages should result in accelerated sales growth. Moreover, at the time of the call, the company reported October comps were up 23.6% to 2019 while noting the Christmas holiday shift would represent a 1.5%-pt headwind and that comparisons would get tougher heading into the holiday season. Consequently, we remain comfortable with the Street mean of 21.5% to 2019 (Stifel 23%). While not shying away from the need to offset some portion of inflation via price, management is focused on protecting traffic and growing sales. The company is also careful to maintain a value gap to competitors to protect its customer value proposition. Marketing initiatives to support SRS growth in 2022. Notably, the company's strong sales recovery has been achieved despite the tabling of several marketing initiatives during the pandemic. In 2022, the company plans to highlight early dining opportunities and return to more normalized levels of local store marketing to drive additional customer occasions. For example, we expect the restaurants will be more aggressive with the 'Wild West Wednesday’ offer in 2022. The company is also evaluating unique steak offerings in international markets that offer price- point value, larger portions, and emphasize different cooking styles; however, none of these items are currently being tested in domestic markets. Beef inflation has been moderating. Spot beef prices suggest the inflation rate has moderated meaningfully in recent periods, indicating the company's high-teens inflation guidance for 1Q22 could prove conservative, assuming the current trend holds. Texas Roadhouse ages its cuts for 30-45 days, meaning the company is reflecting beef costs on roughly a one-month lag to the spot market. Management indicated visibility was relatively high due to this dynamic when the company provided its high-teens inflation guidance for 4Q on the last earnings call, suggesting much of the buying for 4Q had already occurred. Exhibit 1 illustrates the recent movement in year-over-year spot sirloin inflation. Following significant volatility in June as prices lapped abnormally low levels last year, year-over-year pressure peaked in late August and September before moderating significantly. Still, absolute price levels remain elevated, and low visibility across the industry has left suppliers unwilling to lock in contracts without significant premiums, leaving the company with more exposure to spot market volatility than usual. For its part, management still believes commodity inflation will ultimately be cyclical but concedes the timing of any normalization is still unknown.

UAA US,UAA,Dec 16 2021 04:32PM,"Under Armour, Inc.",Sports and Lifestyle Brands,Downgrading UAA to Hold as Lower Confidence in FY23E Upside Capacity Tempers our Multiple View; TP to $24 ,"We are reducing our 12 mos. TP to $24 from $30 and downgrading shares to Holdfrom Buy, reflecting lower confidence in potential for revenue and margin upside across FY23. Fundamental improvement potential through FY23E appears appropriately reflected in consensus margin expectations. Earnings upside becomes more dependent on revenue acceleration/upside for which visibility is challenging and our confidence is low. Checks showing higher levels of online outlet inventory vs. pre-pandemic levels raise concern of a return of promotional pressure to margins. We remain impressed with turnaround achievements and strategic direction and continue to see our prevailing estimates of $6bn sales and $0.82 EPS in FY23E as achievable. Lower confidence in upside potential, however, sobers our view of multiple potential, and we see risk/reward largely in balance. Our $24 target price reflects 16x EV/EBITDA on our FY23E estimate of $675mn. ","Downgrade Rationale: We are downgrading shares to Hold from Buy and trimming our target price to $24 from $30. Our more cautious view of upside potential for shares reflects three key factors that move risk/reward into a more balanced position: 1. Higher consensus estimates create a greater hurdle for upside: following strong execution through 2021, improving quality of sales and a solidifying foundation for EBIT margins to progress to double-digits, consensus estimates moved sharply higher and now reflect FY23 EBIT margins at 9.0% and EPS of $0.80 EPS, up from 7.0% and $0.59 before the 3Q21 report. While these estimates are achievable, they raise the threshold to deliver upside and increase the dependence on revenue acceleration. Said another way, the cost structure has been reset and incremental margin and earnings depend on sales upside beyond the prevailing expectations for the low-end of high-single digits. 2. Apparel and footwear categories face difficult comparisons in 2022: According to government data and our projections for 4Q21, Clothing and Footwear category spending improved nearly 30% y/y in 2021. While this was against a depressed level in 2020, the 2021 figure still represents a 9% CAGR from 2019 levels. Athletic and comfort casual categories gained share within the broader footwear and apparel landscape and yet Under Armour’s North American division revenue guidance implies CY21 revenue more or less flat to 2019 reflecting quality of revenue decisions (fewer closeouts, reduced distribution, SKU rationalization). While wholesale demand is robust into 2022 making spring visibility strong, end market demand faces difficult comparisons and the Under Armour brand momentum is lagging the category suggesting particular vulnerability to any category deceleration. 3. Higher online outlet inventory vs. 2019 could be an early signal of a more promotional environment: Checks on the “Outlet” tab of underarmour.com in December show 1,932 outlet items for 4QTD, +8% vs. the comparable 4Q19 period, though down from elevated 2020 levels. Note, these checks do not reflect data on inventory in Factory House stores or on international websites. Higher inventory with a notable increase in women’s (+28% vs. 4Q19) could be a signal of difficulties selling direct at full price. Since the initial COVID shock, demand has come back strong and lower promotions have helped both channel partner and DTC enjoy robust margins (for UAA, towards the 50% threshold for the first time since 2007). Investors understand some level of promotion will return to the market, but we are expressing caution given the potential challenges to further margin upside in FY23.",Jim Duffy,"Jim Duffy;Peter McGoldrick, CFA",24,,Hold,-,USD,0.82,,,,,,6.00B,,,,,STIFEL_UAA_CoNote_2021-12-16.pdf,UAA_CoNote_2021-12-16,,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=0f04d5a3-2a82-4a87-8c5a-f1682c9c04a1&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

EBIT of $284mm compares to consensus of $183mm and was driven by 25.8% comp growth (consensus 19%, buyside low 20s) and gross margin (39.6%, consensus 37.5%). Comp upside was driven by double-digit growth in most categories relative to 2019 levels, except makeup. Highlights include store sales growth increased for the second consecutive quarter compared to 2019 levels, digital sales growth was positive y/y despite tough comparisons, and Ultamate Rewards membership growth accelerated sequentially relative to F2Q21 levels, all indicating Ulta is gaining share of a solidly growing U.S. beauty market. The company gave preliminary F2022 expectations, including comp growth inline with long- term targets and EPS growth despite anticipated y/y operating margin contraction. We lift EPS estimates and our price target to $435, 21x F2023E EPS, seeing more upside than downside from current levels. ","Updated F2021 guidance, thoughts on implied F4Q21 and F2022 guidance. Management raised full-year F2021 guidance, now expecting overall comp sales growth of 36%-37% (was 30%-32%), versus consensus of 34.3%. Operating margin guidance is 14.3%-14.5%, up from previous outlook of ~13%, expected to benefit from leverage of fixed costs, less headwinds from channel shift, improving merchandise margin, and leverage of salon costs based on higher top line growth. Diluted EPS is anticipated to be in the range of $16.70-$17.10 (was $14.50- $14.70), ahead of consensus of ~$15.20. Implied F4Q21 guidance implies high-teens comp growth compared to consensus of 14.2% and EPS of ~$4.50 compared to consensus of $4.06. Preliminary F2022 expectations include comp growth inline with long-term targets and EPS growth despite anticipated y/y operating margin contraction, implying at least mid-single-digit EPS growth compared to F2021 levels, or 9% above current consensus assuming 6% EPS growth. All categories up y/y, makeup still lags 2019. All major categories recorded strong double- digit comp growth driven by lapping last year’s disruption from COVID, product newness, and benefiting from promotional events, including 21 Days of Beauty. Compared to F3Q19, fragrance, bath, skincare, and haircare delivered double-digit growth; however, makeup remains slightly below 2019 levels. Management added that they are encouraged by improving trends in prestige makeup while mass cosmetics continues to grow. Also notable, the company said it will launch Olaplex in all stores and on ulta.com in January, it expanded MAC into an additional 200 stores in F3Q21, and launched Bobbi Brown, which was not previously available at Ulta. Reward member levels improve as consumers return to stores. Ultamate Rewards members grew 13% y/y and 3% sequentially to 35.9mm members, a return to pre-pandemic member penetration levels. Management attributes this quarter’s member growth to a reactivation of lapsed members and active member retention, likely benefiting from the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions and return to brick-and-mortar shopping as member recruitment and purchase behavior skews in-store. Additionally, management highlighted that spend per member is now at an all-time high and we estimate sales per member grew ~16% y/y.

As the leader in real-time 3D content, Unity is well positioned to capture the evolving ecommerce opportunity, in our view. We maintain our Buy rating and $190 price target. ","Unity Forma technology behind new eBay 3D true view feature. eBay announced that select sneaker sellers will be able to try out a pilot feature of 3D technology being offered in collaboration with Unity. Buyers on the platform will be able to interact with and view a virtual representation of the sneaker, which can be crucial when purchasing unique or pre-owned goods. If you recall, a week after Unity announced the release of Forma for Create, the company announced an acquisition of RestAR. The technology gained from the acquisition has helped power the true view feature for eBay as users are able to create a photorealistic 3D image of the item for sale using just an app on their mobile phone. We believe sneakers are just the beginning for the 3D interactive technology, and expect more platforms and sellers will adopt the software to differentiate themselves from competitors. The increased emphasis towards online shopping has created a need for vendors to reinvent the buying experience to engage customers in a new way. While the partnership will start with select sneaker sellers on eBay, we believe the 3D technology can expand to all different types of consumer goods such as: sunglasses, dresses, jackets, sweaters, and more. The software can be especially beneficial when trying to sell used or unique goods whose condition a buyer may need to inspect before making a purchasing decision. As the world continues to shift towards digital shopping, driven first by the pandemic, we believe Unity's Create technology can help the company gain market share in a fast-growing industry that can utilize interactive 3D software.

VERX US,VERX,Dec 02 2021 04:54PM,"Vertex, Inc.",Enterprise Software,VERX NDR Recap ,"On Wednesday (12/1) we hosted Vertex's management for a series of investor meetingsduring which the conversation focused around the company's ability to accelerate its ARR growth rate on the heels of an improving ERP upgrade cycle and continued customer Cloud migration opportunity, sustain current levels of profitability, the competitive landscape as well as management's M&A strategy. Overall, we believe the company is well positioned to accelerate organic ARR growth over the course of CY22 as comps ease and customers re-engage with their respective ERP upgrade cycles and the regulatory environment becomes less benign. These factors, coupled with positive underlying secular demand environment, strong growth within the company's emerging Cloud business, provides ample opportunity for Vertex to return to consistent mid-teens revenue growth and ~20% EBITDA margins within the next few quarters. ","Conversation Points Transition to the cloud - One highlight during conversations was the company's increasing transition to a cloud driven revenue model. More customers are choosing to use Vertex's cloud offerings. Management noted that up to 95% of their new customers are opting for cloud based services, and 50% of the company's cross-sells involve cloud products. Additionally, between 3% and 4% of existing customers are switching over to those products each year. While at the moment cloud offerings represent roughly 35% of the company's software revenues, management believes that number will reach 50% within the next couple of years. Taximo and LCR Dickenson Acquisitions - The company's two most recent acquisitions came up in discussion with management noting that as it pertains to Taximo, the integration of the company is going well with part of those offerings already hitting the market. As for the LCR Dickenson acquisition, it was said that Vertex's current penetration in the SAP business represents an opportunity for them and that previously LCR products had been a differentiating factor in that area, but it was available for licensing to anyone. Vertex's sole ownership of that product should help it improve its win rate within the SAP eco-system. Customer churn - Of particular interest for some investors was the level of customer churn the company has seen. Management addressed those concerns saying that churn continues to exist at the low end of its customer base within its Cloud product set. Management expects this to abate in coming quarters. The company also noted that churn is not affecting the GRR, NRR, or their average revenue per customer. Additionally, on customer levels, the company's existing partnerships count as one customer in their counts, however those partners are selling to more than one customer externally, so customer levels in reality are stronger than what is shown in reports. Hiring for growth - Finally, management said that the biggest risk to the company's growth at the moment lies in their ability to hire talent. That talent is needed to have the capacity to handle new customers and growth and when asked how they have been doing so far on their hiring targets, the response was that they are ""on the bubble"" in terms of having enough talent and that they are hiring well but likely need to do better to get where they want to be.",Brad R.

Price at 5% has upside if FY21 exit rate CPI remains high in FY22. Volume at 1-2% is the underlying trend but willing to trade volume to drive more price. M&A likely to finish strong in 4Q21 or open strong in 1Q22 (year-end closing puts and takes) with better activity on the west coast and Canada. RINs hedged about 60% in FY21 at about 20% below the current market. Expire Dec 31, 2021, look to reset in FY22. ESG targets are all consistent with the underlying business model and strategic plan just now supported by data and added transparency. Our observations M&A likely to be another outsized year in FY22. Four regions may become five at the point the current group are managing more than $1.5B to $2.0B in sales. FY22 price upside likely, if CPI at current levels persists and That suggests there is visibility about price at least 5.5% in FY22 and FY23.

In our view, this multiple reflects our belief that the company can deliver long-term, sustainable growth as it continues to expand its presence in key markets like dental and widens its go-to-market efforts to penetrate newer market areas. Risks to our target price include a downturn in small business software spending related to an economic downturn, the failure of Weave to achieve critical mass in newer verticals, and slower than expected adoption and usage of newer engagement modules and the company's nascent payments offering. ","The technologies that have arisen during the 21st century have made sweeping changes in the way that people communicate with each other and businesses, and the days of blindly calling someone with little context around the purpose of your call are largely a thing of the past. While we have all gained comfort in multi-channel communications in our personal lives, that concept has only begun to permeate the business landscape, as organizations realize the power of providing personalized touch points on the preferred channel of their customer. To deliver that level of personalization, organizations need to have their communications channels deeply integrated with data from their core systems, and have access to analytics that can help improve customer satisfaction in the form of higher response rates, positive reviews, and seamless processes. That is the vision for Weave’s all-in-one customer communications and engagement platform. Instead of relying on outdated phone systems, a handful of software tools, and a plethora of paper-based processes, organizations in verticals like dental, optometry, veterinary and others can leverage the platform for streamlined engagement with their patients or customers. Weave combines its proprietary cloud communications system (IP phones, text messaging, call recording, team chat, mobile app, etc.) with a range of engagement tools (marketing, reviews, payments, etc.) to provide a cohesive experience for users and a seamless experience for the end customer. We believe the need for this approach is most pronounced in the SMB segment of the market that Weave is targeting, as the cost of running and implementing enterprise- focused tools in the communications and engagement areas can be highly cumbersome, and the integrated approach allows individual users to serve multiple functions within an organization on a common platform. We are initiating coverage of Weave Communications with a Buy rating and $27 target price, based on an 8.5x EV/Revenue multiple on our FY23 estimates.

The companydelivered strong net new customer locations and top-line growth, with operating margins decreasing y/y as the company invests for the long-term opportunity in the SMB communications and engagement space. Management struck an optimistic tone around the newer engagement components and payments offering within the platform, which we believe can contribute to steadily increasing ASPs while the company continues to execute on its vertical expansion strategy and capture more logos across markets like dental, optometry, home services, and others. We believe the company is early in its go-to-market, and brand awareness and its emphasis on addressing the needs of specific verticals on a common platform can help differentiate Weave's offering from more horizontal vendors.

WK US,WK,Dec 21 2021 06:44PM,Work kiva Inc.,Enterprise Software,Transferring Coverage of Workiva...Competitor Hack Could Be Near-Term Tailwind ,"Transferring coverage of Workiva to Brad Reback from Tom Roderick. Over the last severalyears Workiva has meaningfully expanded its solution portfolio, enabling the company to effectively accelerate its sustainable growth rate to ~20%+. The company has gained traction in Europe as the ESEF ESMA mandate has rolled out, similar to the US XBRL mandate of 2012. The popularity in ESG has created a need for a comprehensive solution to help companies communicate with investors on the various reportable metrics. Additionally, a long-running hack of legacy competitors opens a new avenue for future market share gains in coming quarters. That said, slowing capital markets activity has the potential to be a growth headwind in '22. Net/net we expect Workiva's broadening product set to enable the company to maintain ~20%+ revenue growth and incremental margin expansion in coming years. We maintain a Buy rating, but lower the TP to $150. ","Hack Of Competitors Presents New Growth Opportunity: On Monday, the SEC announced fraud charges against five Russian nationals that hacked into the systems of two U.S. based filing agent companies, Servicers A and B both of which are direct competitors of Workiva, to gain access to earnings releases prior to public disclosure. This multi-year scheme (2018-2020) generated profits of at least $80mn using stolen information to make trades prior to earnings announcements. According to the complaint Servicer A is a Delaware corporation with its headquarters in Chicago, IL and Servicer B is a foreign company with several US offices. Looking forward, we believe these hacks could serve as a catalyst to get customers to move off these legacy platforms upon contract expiration and become a growth tailwind for Workiva in coming quarters. ESEF ESMA mandate is playing out in real-time, similar to US SEC reporting almost ten years ago: It is worth noting an early catalyst that helped accelerate Workiva’s business was the U.S. mandating the Inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (IXBRL) reporting method about a decade ago. Workiva’s wDesk product helped the company capture the surge in the demand from affected companies and revenue grew from $14.9mn in 2011 to $112.7mn in 2014. While these two mandates aren’t exactly apples to apples, the growth opportunity remains robust as Workiva recognizes less than 10% of revenue from international sources. The ESEF ESMA mandate has now been in effect since January 15, 2021 for year-end reporting starting CY21. Given the timing of the roll-out and competition from competitive offerings (outsource the tagging work, hire internally to manage the work, or use another third party software vendor) we expect growth from this mandate to build incrementally over the coming years. Environmental, Social, and Governance has been making waves across the globe as investors start to demand more from organizations: The requirements of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting have continued to increase as investors have demanded more transparency and governments around the world begin to dip their toe into this pool. Accounting firm PwC announced plans to hire over 100k employees directly related to ESG over the next five years. The European Union is leading the way as it has already implemented a Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). Effective in March, the SFDR was announced in 2018 and is designed to drive capital towards sustainably-oriented Investments. solution-based licensing model and growing number of products has created strong land and expand strategy for Workiva: Over the last several years, via internal development and modest M&A activity, it has expanded well beyond SEC reporting, to what is now a comprehensive platform of data connectors and reporting tools.

ZNTL US,ZNTL,Dec 07 2021 07:59PM,"Zentalis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",Biotechnology,BCL-(me)2? Outlining The ZN-d5 Strategy And Previewing First Early Clinical Data At Dec. 16 R&D Day ,"We are cautious on the first ZN-d5 (BCL-2i) data update expected Dec. 16 if expectationsare for initial signs of efficacy. ZNTL expects to only determine a safe dose at this update. The patient population (n=~20) will be primarily R/R DLBCL, who are not sensitive to monotherapy BCL-2i, but we hope to see some activity in MCL/MZL patients. Overall, the base case for ZN-d5 is a comparable profile with AbbVie's Venclexta, which could share in the $3.5bn BCL-2i market (2025E). The bull case is a superior safety profile and/ or smart partnering with pharma companies for combinations that may extend beyond the Venclexta label and pivotal development operations. We expect ZN-d5 to be more polarizing than the WEE1 program (which mostly has a polarizing valuation) given more questions around development strategy and differentiation, but consider it a solid pipeline expansion program to augment WEE1. BCL-2i deep dive presented herein. ","ZN-d5 has some preclinical advantages over Venclexta, but base case is simple, direct competition. ZN-d5 is more selective than Venclexta for BCL-2 over a related family protein BCL-xL, of which inhibition can cause thrombocytopenia. In preclinical human blood assessments, ZN-d5 has less platelet inhibition. However, Venclexta is already a drug optimized for BCL-2 selectivity, and its small residual potency against BCL-xL results in moderate rates of thrombocytopenia (depending on the cancer and combination drugs) that appear manageable in most cases. As such, the base case for ZNTL's ZN-d5 is to introduce competition into the BCL-2 drug market for blood cancers, including CLL and AML, while a better safety profile would be bonus. Venclexta consensus is $3.5bn by 2025E, and AbbVie maintains a current monopoly on the drug class. AbbVie's dominance has been assisted by the difficult chemistry involved in designing a BCL-2 inhibitor and the company's patent estate that reduces the freedom to operate for potential competitors. ZNTL management strategically chose to develop ZN-d5 as another example to display the company's strong chemistry and drug design capabilities. Long term, development opportunities or differential clinical activity may add value to ZN- d5. ZN-d5 has better activity against certain mutant BCL-2 forms that are observed in patients with resistance to Venetoclax, but there is no available scientific evidence those mutations drive resistance. Given the large numbers of Venclexta refractory patients that will build over the coming years, ZN-d5 could become an important asset if it can show activity in the refractory setting. However, management has not committed to this possibly absent clinical data. Beyond this, program upside is likely to be linked to ZNTL's partnership execution capabilities with large pharma companies for combination therapy developments, where incremental safety improvements may be the biggest advantage. Two Chinese biotechs, BeiGene and Ascentage, are also developing phase 1 BCL-2 inhibitors. These also proclaim to have a better profile for thrombocytopenia. While this is additional competition to consider, it involves fewer potential entrants for a large $3.5bn+ blood cancer market potential than we commonly see in many smaller competitive cancer indications. Cautious interpretation of ZN-d5 efficacy data at R&D Day is required, as many patients would not be expected to respond to a BCL-2 inhibitor monotherapy. ZNTL's main focus for the clinical ZN-d5 update will be the demonstration of a safe and tolerable dose. We caution that the efficacy data will be difficult to interpret in comparison to Venclexta in this first data release. Based on the company's trial-in-progress poster at ESMO 2021, we expect ~20 patients to be included in the dataset. The majority (~50%) will be DLBCL patients, who do not respond to Venclexta monotherapy. Therefore, we would not be surprised by minimal or no activity from ZN-d5 dose-escalation data in this population. Instead, we will be focused on the handful of MCL/MZL patients enrolled in the study. Here, phase 1 Venclexta monotherapy data have demonstrated ORRs of ~70%.

ACN US,ACN,Dec 16 2021 01:12PM,Accenture plc,Information & Financial Technology Services,Strong Fundamental Backdrop + Share Gains = Meaningful Outperformance,"F1Q results exceeded all metrics with revenue growth accelerating (two year stack) reflecting acceleration of digital transformation and share gains. Guidance was increased well above 1Q outperformance, suggesting outperformance of internal goals. As noted repeatedly, ACN's ability to reskill around change at global scale facilitates share gains, particulary during periods of accelerating change (cloud, data, analytics, security) and heightened perception that technology underlies competitive advantage. Management estimates that 30%+ of client workloads have ransitioned to the cloud versus 20% last year, implying continued opportunity; furthermore, follow-on business (data/analytics) is also accelerating. (read-thru to EPAM , INFY and IBM GBS in our coverage). ACN is +8% today (S&P500 flattish), 2x the increase to EPS guidance and the premium relative to the S&P500 is 75%+ reflecting accelerating growth among other dynamics. Growth will moderate next year (+8%); therefore, we have set our price-target ($440) at a 60%+ premium applied to FY24EEPS. ","Bookings Record bookings ($16.8bn) were up 30% y/y, with particular strength in faster conversion consulting (+41%), and roughly 10% above recent trend. Despite strength in F1Q, management indicated they were very comfortable with the current pipeline suggesting bookings momentum could continue. The company added 14 diamond clients (largest clients) in the quarter versus 13 all of last year. Undoubtedly, some of this increase is skewed by the pandemic, but the increase also reflects the rising importance of ACN within its client base and follow-on workflows after cloud conversions. Revenue/Guidance Growth was strong across all business dimensions/geographies, although the recovery of consulting/strategy is driving faster conversion of bookings to revenue. Organic cc revenue growth normalized for compares accelerated to 12% y/y up from 8% last quarter and the company guided to similar growth in F2Q. Revenue guidance for the year was increased 575bp for the year (14-17% organic cc, ~12% on a 2 year stack), net of F1Q outperformance (125bp). EPS guidance increased 320bp, net of F1Q outperformance. We are forecasting 8% revenue growth in FY23 (consensus in-line). Margins/Wage Inflation/Pricing Like others in the industry, the company is feeling the impacts of the tight labor market and annual wage adjustments could weigh on y/y margin comparisons in F2Q. That said, we feel very comfortable with the company's ability to deliver on their FY22 (Aug) margin target of +10-30bp. Management indicated that they are starting to get some price improvement to offset higher wages (reflected in current quarter bookings) and expressed optimism that they will get further price improvements going forward, which we believe is achievable and potential tailwind to revenue growth and margins in F2H.",David M.

IBM US,IBM,Dec 14 2021 09:56PM,International Business Machines Corp., Information & Financial Technology Services,Reformulating Estimates for KD Spin; Roadmap Requires Step-up in Execution,"Our updated earnings model reflects the completed spin of IBM's outsourcing unit Kyndryl (KD). Our 6% 2022 proforma revenue growth forecast (consensus not adjusted) is consistent with guidance (return to revenue growth); however, we estimate non-recurring/cyclical factors will contribute 400-500bp of growth (KD spin-off, mainframe cycle) with acquisitions adding another 100bp. Consulting growth (30% of proforma revenue) has stabilized at LSD's this year after normalizing for compares; however, software growth remains negative and likely underlies IBM's material underperformance relative to the S&P500. Management has made many well documented changes over the past 24 months geared to reaccelerate software growth including expanded channel partnerships, more targeted account management, revamped sales compensation and acquisitions, which remain the primary catalyst for re-rating (trading at 12x UFCF). In the meantime, patient investors can collect a 5.3% dividend yield. We estimate FCF is sustainable at $10-11bn/yr with modest potential growth as margins expand. ","2022 Outlook Kyndryl (KD) impact. Subsequent to the separation, Kyndryl's purchase of software/ hardware for its outsourcing customers will be treated as external revenue. Previously, this revenue was reported by GTS (KD former name), which has been reclassified to discontinued operations. KD will generate $350mn of revenue to IBM in 2021 and ~$2.5bn in 2022. We estimate ~90% of this revenue, or $315mn and $2.25bn respectively will be software licenses sold to KD outsourcing customers. These amounts will be included in software revenue (transaction processing platforms, or TPP) and represent a 5% tailwind to software revenue growth in 4Q21 and a 8% tailwind in 2022. Onaconsolidated proforma basis (ex KD), the new structure yields a 1.7% tailwind to total IBM growth in 4Q21 and 3% in 2022. Acquisitions. Acquisitions are expected to add ~100bp to growth in 2022, which assumes 100bp/yr for software and 200bp/yr for consulting (substitute for hiring/training). We estimate IBM acquired 9 companies in 1H21 (4 software, including Turbonomic) and in 2H21 (1 software). Mainframe cycle. We are currently modeling the new mainframe to ship in 1H22. We estimate the mainframe plus new Power products will add over a point to y/y revenue growth in 2022 and another 50bp in 2023. FCF. We expect IBM to report slightly above $10bn in 2021 proforma FCF, which is ~$11bn in pre-spin FCF less $750mn generated by Kyndryl. Given the proforma business mix (largely software and services), we expect FCF conversion of 100%+ on a sustainable basis, which implies ~$11bn of FCF in 2022, including a $750mn tailwind from 2021 cost actions, operating leverage from growth, mix, etc.",David M.

Two treatment-related SAEs were reported (G3 ejection fraction decrease and G4 bronchopulmonary hemorrhage), both of which led to treatment discontinuation. The most common all-Grade treatment-related AEs included infusion-related reaction (19%), pyrexia (9%), diarrhea (9%), and fatigue (7%). We believe safety/tolerability data collectively suggest ample flexibility on the dose-escalation front (particularly as it pertains to more-frequent administration). Biomarker data appears consistent with BDC-1001 mechanism of action. 22 paired biopsies have been collected to date (baseline and on-treatment at C2D4 for patients on the Q3W schedule or C3D4 for patients on the Q2W schedule), 12 of which have been analyzed for biomarkers (analyses of additional samples are ongoing). Management presented data from two of these paired biopsies — including one from a HER2-amplified cervical cancer patient who received 5mg/kg Q3W BDC-1001 and one from a HER2+ (IHC3+) breast cancer patient who received 8mg/kg Q3W.

CHPT US,CHPT,Dec 10 2021 01:04PM,"ChargePoint Holdings, Inc.",NextGen Transport,Well Positioned for Robust Multi-Year Growth; Reiterate Buy with $29 Target Price ,"CHPT delivered better-than-expected 3Q22 revenue, raised full-year guidance, and posted sharply higher margins in its Network Charging Systems business due to structural cost reductions. Although Subscription revenue (in line) and margins (a little light) seemed to raise some concerns, we are confident that Subscription revenue will rise sharply going forward and that gross margins will trend from the mid 40s to upper 50s over the next few years as the business scales. We reiterate our Buy with a $29 target price. ","Modest Revenue Beat: Third quarter revenue of $65.0 million beat our $63.8 million by 2.0% driven by solid growth across all verticals, and was at the top end of guidance. Gross margins continue to rise and easily surpassed our expectations. Key Takeaways (+) Total revenue of $65.0 million came in slightly above our $63.8 million forecast, rose 15.9% sequentially from $56.1 million, and climbed 78.8% year-over year. The sequential increase was widespread, driven primarily by the strong performance of the commercial, residential, and fleet verticals in the North American and European markets. (+) Total gross profit of $16.1 million beat our $14.7 million estimate by 9.0%, climbed 49.0% sequentially, and surged 121.3% year-over-year. Acquisitions and sequential cost improvements were drivers of the rise in gross profit Inflationary pressures and increases to logistical costs resulting in a 200 basis point hit to the company's gross margin, a slight improvement from the 300 basis point detraction observed during the prior quarter. Network Charging Systems margins jumped to 18.5% from 13.4% despite headwinds due to significant structural cost improvements that bode well for margins going forward. Subscription margins were a bit light of our forecast at 43.0% versus our 48.5% forecast, but improved sharply from the prior quarter. Margins were impacted by investments in the business that should help future margins. In fact, we expect margins to rise toward 60% over the next few years. (+) Total activated charging ports increased sequentially to 163,000 from 118,000 driven in part by the acquisition of has.to.be, which should drive solid growth in Europe. (+) Commercial and fleet billings climbed to new record highs for the company, aided by the addition of ViriCiti. (=) Management noted that subscription revenue tends to lag installations by roughly a quarter, thus indicating the segment is poised for solid growth given the sharp up tick in active charging ports during the third quarter. (-) Cost inflation continues to act as a headwind for the company with management highlighting that logistical costs are of particular concern. (+) Management increased full-year guidance to $235-240 million from $225-235 million, and provided 4Q guidance of $73-78 million versus our prior fourth quarter estimate of $72.5 million. Maintaining Buy and $29 Target Price: We are maintaining our buy rating on CHPT and our $29 target price based on our 10-year DCF analysis.

ENTG US,ENTG,Dec 07 2021 04:56PM,"Entegris, Inc.",Semiconductor Capital Equipment,Managing Through Supply Chain Challenges While Industry Trends Remain Tailwinds to Above-Average Growth Outlook ,"On Tuesday at Semicon West, we caught up with Entegris CEO and President, Bertrand Loy. With the company providing a long-term update on market and business trends at its recent Analyst Day (see our note, Entegris: Stronger Semi Outlook + Non-Semis Growth (Life Sciences) = Higher Revenues and EBITDA Outlook; Target Price to $180, Dec. 1), we spent time discussing some other key market trends, such as the evolving supply chain and the potential impact of regionalization (both for Entegris and its potential impact for its customers). In total, we remain favorably biased on Entegris’ long-term opportunities both in the semiconductor and other markets (like life sciences). We believe the company is poised to outpace overall industry trends on a sustained basis, and we maintain our Buy rating on the shares. ","From a supply chain perspective, we believe Entegris has managed the situation well given its diverse businesses (across three business units) and its ability to meet Street expectations. These challenges persist in the near term, but Entegris continues to make progress to alleviate some of these challenges. Logistics remains a significant issue (not only for Entegris, but the industry as a whole) and the issues here do not appear to be abating. We have stated previously that they will persist into 2022 and not likely to completely disappear until 2023. We also believe it is too early to tell if there will be structural changes to the supply chain and inventory management because of the current situation. From a regionalization perspective, we believe that the current Chips Act being worked on in Congress has seen amendments that would make eligible materials and equipment companies to receive government funding to support increased U.S. participation in the semiconductor industry. We believe this would put Entegris in line to potentially receive U.S. government funding. We have noted the greater importance of Entegris’ solutions on both the materials and purity control fronts, and this is critical for a chipmaker’s (such as Intel) ecosystem. To prevent bottlenecks across this ecosystem, we believe the U.S. government needs to assist not only the chipmakers but those downstream, like materials suppliers and equipment companies. In our view, if the Chips Act passes with these modifications, this would be incrementally positive for Entegris. From a big picture, market perspective, our thesis in the name remains firmly intact. We believe the company is well positioned to benefit from key semiconductor technology inflections with its three-pronged market approach. Its focus on materials engineering, purity control, and materials handling are all drivers for growth in the semiconductor industry (through wafer start increases and new fab investments). In particular, many of these aspects are becoming critical to enhancing yields and this has brought Entegris closer to its customer base. We expect the company to continue to outpace overall industry trends (the company estimates by a margin of +3-5% on an annual basis vs. industry rates). We believe the expertise on the semiconductor end is also applicable to other markets, and in particular, life sciences. Management highlighted the increasing investments in this market, and how it is leveraging its technology on the semiconductor end in the life sciences market. Purity control is becoming more critical in life science applications and we expect the company to introduce future products to serve these needs.",Patrick J. Ho,"Patrick J.

EVBG US,EVBG,Dec 09 2021 08:08PM,"Everbridge, Inc.",Software: Applications,Surprise CEO Resignation and Lighter '22 Outlook Introduces Uncertainty; Downgrading to Hold ,"On Thursday afternoon Everbridge announced the resignation of CEO David Meredith and offered an initial outlook of 20-23% growth in 2022, which came in below street expectations. In our view, the timing and uncertainty around the circumstances of Mr. Meredith's departure combined with the company's guidance introduces a high degree of uncertainty into the story in the near term, and we are moving to the sidelines while we digest the disruption Mr. Meredith's departure will have on the company's operations and assess the potential changes made to the business under its new Co-CEO's and future leadership. With growth decelerating from ~36% in 2021 (high end of guide) to ~23% in 2022 (high end of guide), we believe there are more questions than answers at this point. We are downgrading from Buy to Hold and lowering our target price from $185 to $100 on EVBG shares. ","After the market close on Thursday, Everbridge announced the resignation of CEO and Board Director, David Meredith. In response, the company has opened an Office of the CEO, where CFO Patrick Brickley and CRO Vernon Irvin will hold dual-control of operational and strategic decisions as Co-CEOs. Everbridge will also immediately open a search for a new permanent replacement for CEO, and will consider both internal and external candidates for the role. Although the company did reaffirm its F4Q21 and FY21 financial forecast, the initial outlook of 20-23% revenue growth in FY22 came in below street expectations. The news comes as a surprise to us, particularly with the accelerating growth trajectory of the business in 3Q, management's mid-30s growth outlook for 4Q, and the recent set of countrywide wins in Europe that were just announced. We believe investors will be in search of answers in regard to the initial outlook to '22, the potential for CEM to continue gaining traction, and the pace of margin expansion over the mid-term.

FRLN US,FRLN,Dec 17 2021 03:37PM,Freeline Therapeutics Holdings plc,Biotechnology,"Management Call: Several Important Catalysts in 2022, But Adjusting Estimates on Guidance; TP $12"," Revisiting FLT180a (Hemophilia B [Hem B]) data at the American Society of Hematology (ASH; LINK), we can appreciate investors' wavering optimism on FRLN's overall progress and pipeline. Admittedly, our follow-up conversation with management did not offer a compelling rebuttal per se; however, with shares trading below cash and a pipeline of assets that could upend today's investor sentiment, we await 2022 and its respective updates that may present an important inflection point for the stock. Just as positive data emerging from a small 'n' in a heterogeneous population should be interpreted with caution, we look forward to stress testing our thesis as more data are reported. Meanwhile, FRLN's 2022 guidance necessitates changes to our model including the removal of FLT210 (Hemophilia A [Hem A]) resulting in a lower TP to $12 (vs. $19 previously). Reiterate Buy. ","Few thoughts on FLT180a (Hem B) go-forward dose. First, it appears a manuscript is in the works that can shed light on Ph.1/2 B-AMAZE details including granular aspects of each patient and their respective responses to treatment. The go-forward dose (7.7E11 vg/kg) was determined based on model projections of B-AMAZE data particularly on cohorts 1, 3, and 4 and their early responses to FLT180a treatment (i.e., ~week 0-25). With the caveat of small 'n' and some liver enzyme elevations that consequently confound durable factor IX (FIX) activity levels, we do see some dose response: cohort 1 (3.84E11; ~40-55%), cohort 3 (6.4E11; ~60-70%), and cohort 4 (8.32E11; ~180-250%). The ultimate durability outcome, unsurprisingly, is contingent upon sufficient immune suppression. Few thoughts on FLT180a immune suppression. ASH poster details an evolution of immune suppression regimen with cohort 4 receiving prednisolone and tacrolimus at week 3. It also highlights that the regimen differed between patient 7 and patients 8-10, with patients 8-10 receiving a more prolonged course of tacrolimus extending beyond the taper of steroids. FRLN has two takeaways: 1) patient 7 likely received too short of a tacrolimus regimen - hence the incidence of delayed transaminitis, and 2) patients 8-10 likely received too long of a tacrolimus regimen that may have interfered with newly expressed FIX. Unlike the dosing determination, immune suppression - at least for now - cannot rely on model projections and thus the go-forward decision based on B-AMAZE may not be accurate. That said, with the caveat of a small 'n’, FRLN referred to the go-forward regimen as most closely mimicking patient 5's experience (cohort 3). Granted, patient 3 received a reactive immune suppression regimen (i.e., transaminitis treated at week 4), but by implementing a more prophylactic strategy, FRLN believes it can achieve sufficient immune suppression and avoid compromising FIX activity leading to a more durable outcome (vs. cohort 4). FLT190 (Fabry disease) updates in 2022. Per guidance, investors can expect 2 sets of updates next year - 1H22 and 2H22. The 1H22 update will encompass safety observations (week 8-12) from patient 3 (7.5E11 vg/kg) such as troponin levels, in addition to longer term follow-up of patients 1-2. Subsequently, patient 4 will be dosed - as part of the dose escalation - with early data to emerge, combined with longer-term follow-up of patients 1-3, in 2H22. With mixed data from FRLN and competitors thus far further compounded by investor skepticism on the commercial opportunity, investors ascribe minimal value to FLT190. Should it (and perhaps FLT201) demonstrate AAVS3's utility in lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) via updates in 2022+, however, there may be renewed investor interest flowing into the stock. Model updates - removing FLT210. We are removing FLT210 (Hem A) revenues from our model until future updates dictate otherwise. We continue to model a gradual YoY increase in OpEx but in the near-term reflect cost impact due to a ~25% reduction in workforce.",Dae Gon Ha,"Dae Gon Ha, PhD;Jacques Villefranc, PhD",12,19,Buy,-,USD,2.89,3.44,,,,,0,,,,,STIFEL_FRLN_CoNote_2021-12-17.pdf,FRLN_CoNote_2021-12-17,,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=7c07afa9-1ef7-433c-8729-3f619773aa30&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
FRPT US,FRPT,Dec 17 2021 10:35AM,"Freshpet, Inc.",Household & Personal Products,"Reducing Estimates for Ongoing Logistics Challenges; Good Business, Good Category for Longer-Term Investors ","Freshpet reduced 2021 sales and adjusted EBITDA expectations, now anticipating $115mm- $120mm for 4Q21 sales, compared to consensus of $133mm. We think this more reflects ongoing supply chain challenges impacting production capacity than end-demand, where sales trends in scanner data, a reasonable proxy for demand, have sequentially accelerated through 4Q21. We anticipate a more material improvement from recent run-rate levels given the benefit from a ~5% price increase implemented in late November, and which should show up in data beginning next week. We estimate mid-30s y/y growth for 2022 in scanner data extrapolating the current 2-year sales CAGR through next year. This excludes the benefit of a more material price increase announced today and effective late February 2022, which we think is likely low double- digits, bringing total pricing, to mid-to-high-teens. We reduce estimates and our price target to $135, but see a more favorable risk/reward from current levels for longer-term investors.","Good business, good category...but earning back trust is key. We view Freshpet as a good business in a good category but also think recent overly optimistic guidance is likely to result in shares remaining rangebound pending increased visibility regarding achievement of longer-term targets and nearer-term production/supply chain goals. Upcoming catalysts include generally improving scanner data and initial 2022 guidance, likely in late February in conjunction with yearend 2021 results. We think setting a low, achievable bar is key, especially as we anticipate accelerating sales trends through 2022 given generally favorable end-demand and the benefit from pricing. We also think Freshpet could be an attractive acquisition target, though we have no knowledge of any current discussions. Supply chain challenges continue. We attribute the 2021 sales guidance reduction to ongoing supply chain challenges, most notably on bags, where the company previously said the start- up of a new high-speed line at its co-packer was delayed due to port delays in 3Q21. That said, capacity was a problem even before Covid, and has worsened with broader global logistics challenges. Freshpet is balancing the opening of a greenfield facility in Texas, scheduled to open in 2Q22, and meaningful capacity increases to its main production facility in Pennsylvania and at its third-party co-packer. Household penetration and competition. We view ongoing supply chain challenges and out-of- stocks as potentially impacting the company’s 11mm household penetration target by 2025. We understand management does not believe they have lost a meaningful number of customers, though some loss is likely. We view this as a watchpoint. Additionally, while we anticipate competition will increase, we think it could also increase category awareness, and ultimately penetration of more healthful, fresh pet food from low-single-digits today. Pricing and elasticity. The company announced an additional, “significantly larger” price increase effective 2/28/2022. We anticipate it to be ~10%, bringing total pricing to mid-to-high teens. We think pet food elasticity is generally solid, likely resulting in the company retaining 50%-70% of total pricing, or ~10%. Freshpet’s pricing is consistent with most of the rest of U.S. pet food companies, which have taken considerable price increases to offset ongoing inflation.",Mark S. Astrachan,"Mark S.

ONTO US,ONTO,Dec 07 2021 09:27PM,Onto Innovation Inc.,Semiconductor Capital Equipment,Multi Industry Tailwinds Drive Growth Outlook While Size and Scale Increases Can Accelerate These Prospects," On Tuesday, we caught up with Onto Innovation CEO and President, Mike Plisinski, where we discussed some of the key industry trends, as well as its growth opportunities. To date, the company has managed through the current supply chain environment, as we expect these challenges to persist. From a regionalization perspective, we believe the amendments to the Chips Act to include equipment companies should be a benefit for Onto, given its increasing size and strong exposure to U.S. manufacturing (across Massachusetts, Minnesota, and the Bay Area). Finally, our favorable thesis remains firmly intact, as Onto is well positioned to benefit from strong market trends, both in front-end wafer fab equipment (WFE) spending and on the advanced packaging/specialty devices end. As evidence of this growing opportunity, Onto announced an $85 million order from a 3D NAND manufacturer for its suite of metrology solutions (that will be delivered in 2022 and 2023). ","We believe Onto has managed through the current supply chain/elevated cost environment well given its recent results and outlook. As expected, these challenges persist and there are always “spot problems’ that not only Onto but the industry is continually dealing with. Logistics also remain an issue, as this aspect is something all equipment companies are dealing with. We emphasize again that we do not see this issue resolving itself in 2022, and the earliest we could see negligible impact is exiting next year. At the same time, we remain comfortable with our current estimates for Onto in the December quarter and for 2022. From a regionalization perspective, we believe the amended Chips Act to include potential government funding for equipment and materials companies should be a benefit for Onto when all is said and done. The company’s main manufacturing capabilities are located in Massachusetts (advanced packaging, stepper), Minnesota (defect inspection), and the Bay Area (metrology). With an almost $5B market cap and broaching $900 million to $1 billion in annual revenues, we believe Onto has a strong argument for government support given its sizable U.S. manufacturing footprint and its position in the value chain for key customers like Intel, Micron, GlobalFouundries, and in U.S. fabs for the likes of Samsung and TSMC. Our thesis on the name remains firmly intact and Onto remains one of our preferred names. We believe Onto is well positioned to capitalize on increasing capital intensity trends for metrology in the front-end and growing needs in the advanced packaging and specialty devices markets. On Tuesday, the company announced an $85 million order that includes various solutions from its suite of products (which includes dimensional, thin film, hard mask, and integrated capabilities). From a customer perspective, this approach provides yield enhancements and a lower cost-of-ownership, given the increasing challenges in overall semiconductor manufacturing. We also believe the company is poised to benefit from strong market growth trends in the advanced packaging and specialty devices (such as RF, power, compound semis) segments. These are just some of the market tailwinds for Onto today. We believe the company continues to explore potential M&A that can further accelerate its growth prospects. We have noted the need for size and scale to compete more effectively, and Onto can accelerate its growth through future M&A. We are confident in management's discipline and outlook on M&A, although we have NO insight on its plans.",Patrick J. Ho,"Patrick J.

PEB US,PEB,Dec 21 2021 09:34AM,Pebblebrook Hotel Trust,Lodging REITs,Takeaways From Meeting With PEB Management and Operational Update Provides Operational Update.," This morning, Pebblebrook Hotel Trust provided an update on recent operating trends. The company highlighted they have seen a continuation of strong demand thus far in 4Q since the mid-September reacceleration. To this point, the company saw strong RevPAR in November of $128, with ADRs ~2% higher when compared to 2019. Of note, November total revenue was down ~33% from 2019 levels, tying July as the best month on a relative basis for the company since the pandemic began. Management believes December is likely to further improve from November, being down ~30% from 2019 on a total revenue basis. Additionally, the company continues to see an increase in business travel given an increased weekday occupancy, a trend that began in October. We would note that management highlighted the uncertainty surrounding hotel demand given the Omicron variant, and would expect some group business cancellation in 1Q22.","Leisure Remains Strong At Resorts. PEB's resort portfolio continues to drive an ADR premium over 2019. For the weekend of December 10, PEB's resort portfolio ran at 66% occupancy (up from 64% the week prior) with ADR of $351 (relative to 2019 ADR of $224). In our recent meeting with management, they spoke positively on the strength of the resorts in the company's portfolio. Margaritaville continues to be a market leader, with strong F&B performance leading them to consider converting additional space to this use. They also spoke positively on the company's Jekyll Island asset. This market and asset draw repeat customers from the Southeastern US on yearly vacations. Weekly Trends Strong Despite December Seasonality. For the week ended December 12, the company's total portfolio saw occupancy of 55% and ADR of $228, with occupancy up from 51% and ADR flat relative to the week prior. The company's resort portfolio continues to perform well on a full-week basis, with occupancy and ADR for the week of December 12 of 57% and ADR of $304. Labor Market Mixed. In our meeting earlier this week, management noted that while they still face a tight labor market, the dynamic is mixed based upon position. They noted that they're having a tougher time finding back of house workers for the portfolio's F&B offerings. The strong market position of the company's assets has helped draw front of house workers through competitive wages and tips. Recently Acquired La Jolla Hotel & Spa. On December 1, PEB announced that the company had acquired the 210-room AAA Four Diamond Estancia La Jolla Hotel & Spa for $108 million, or ~ $514k per key. The acquisition was funded with ~$46 million of cash on hand and the assumption of ~$62 million of existing non-recourse secured debt. The interest rate on that debt is ~5.1%. Extended Debt Maturities. On December 9th, PEB announced that they had extended ~ $1 billion of debt maturities. It extended the maturity of $611 million of its senior unsecured credit facility from January 2022 to March 2024, $274 million of term loans were extended from January 2023 to March 2024, and $162.8 million of term loans may be extended at the company's option from November 2022 to November 2023. Lastly, it increased the amount of reinvestment proceeds that it can use for acquisitions to $1.0 billion from $500 million;",Simon Yarmak,"Simon Yarmak, CFA;Connor Shockley, CFA",25,25.25,Hold,-,USD,,,,,,,,,,,,STIFEL_PEB_CoNote_2021-12-21.pdf,PEB_CoNote_2021-12-21,,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=48e9d381-2581-4be6-b108-dc78eceadc49&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
SGMO US,SGMO,Dec 13 2021 02:01PM,Sangamo Therapeutics Inc.,Biotechnology,"ASH Update - Great SCD Data, But Perhaps Not Good Enough; Hem A Data Look Similar To Valrox (Clin Hold Remains An Overhang) ","We remain Hold-rated following updates for BIVV003/SAR445136 (SCD) and Hemophilia A programs - although we think SAR445136 could lift the stock near-term following the recent pullback, CRSP’s CTX110 continues to look best-in-class and side effects of preconditioning leave us skeptical on the size of the commercial opportunity of SCD gene/cell therapy. The SAR445136 data represent an incremental positive in our view given the expression of fetal hemoglobin (albeit lower than CTX001), which in turn led to substantial VOC benefit. Our bias on the hemophilia A gene therapy remains unchanged as this looks generally undifferentiated, if not slightly worse than valrox, and we expect durability to continue to weigh on investor enthusiasm. Given the ongoing clinical hold, we'd expect sentiment to remain skeptical. Based on these updated results, we are lowering our forecasted pricing for both SCD and Hem A programs ($1.5mm/patient and $1mm/patient, respectively), which lowers our TP to $9. ","The first look at BIVV003/SAR445136 demonstrated a meaningful increase in 3/4 patients but appears below the bar set by CRSP. Data were presented for 4 patients, with varying levels of pain crises at baseline (annualized event rate was 0, 3, 5 and 11). On average, SAR445136 increased HbF to ~33% of total Hb (range 14-43%) from an average baseline of ~6%. Notably, both BIVV003/SAR445136 and CTX001 operate similarly, wherein the goal is to silence the BCL11A gene, thereby removing a natural fetal hemoglobin (HbF) repressor and inducing HbF expression. We interpret the SAR445136 results as being a bit lower than what was seen with CTX001 treatment in CRSP’s study where, as of EHA 2021, HbF increased to ~42% of total Hb from an average baseline level of 4%. The effect of SAR445136 was remarkable with all four patients being VOC-free with follow-up times ranging between 26 and 91 weeks, save one VOC case that occurred ~9 months post infusion. Interestingly, this patient also experienced the lowest level of HbF production, where levels only reached 14% of total. If both CRSP and SGMO/SNY SCD data continue to mature with exactly the same profile, we wouldn’t expect SAR445136 to be crowned as the market leader, but at the same time this seems no less approvable than CTX001. Today, the SCD gene/cell therapy debate seems largely focused on CTX001 and LentiGlobin, as these agents have the most data. However, there are many other programs that will have data over the next 12-18 months (BEAM, EDIT, NTLA, SGMO/SNY), all with editors that are seemingly capable of taking a similar approach to CTX001 and LentiGlobin where the goal is curative-like efficacy. We don’t expect every product to match CTX001’s clinical profile, but we do think the barriers to entry aren’t prohibitively high, and therefore expect multiple products to eventually reach the market. Our reservation with these assets isn’t so much about the data, but rather it’s that we expect preconditioning regimens to relegate this category to a highly competitive niche segment of the overall SCD market. The SAR445136 data are good — arguably not the best — but we think they do bode well for approval and should garner additional credit in the stock. But our skepticism is on the long- term commercial prospects and our belief that CTX001 will continue to garner investor attention so long as the data look best-in-class; together, this keeps us from building a positive thesis around this asset.

VEEV US,VEEV,Dec 01 2021 10:41PM,Veeva Systems Inc.,Digital Health,"Modest Guide May Pressure Stock Near-Term, but Secular Footings Seem Stable ","F3Q (Oct) revenue/EPS were modestly above consensus/guidance with modest increases to F4Q guidance; billings guidance for the year remained constant, implying a 4Q deceleration. The company also provided initial FY23 (Jan) guidance, which was below consensus. There are many distortions to the billings numbers making it difficult to assess longer-term implications; however, we believe FY22 bookings supports revenue growth in excess of the initial FY23 guide (+17-18%), and continue to believe VEEV will grow 20%+ in FY23. Margin guidance was below consensus, but 100bp above pre-pandemic levels and reasonable. Not surprisingly, the stock traded down ~5% AMC, and we expect some overhang to persist near-term. We are lowering our PT to $305 (+16%) to reflect group multiple compression and some incremental risk. That said, we continue to believe VEEV is at least a high-teens revenue compounder with expanding margins, which implies this stock will attract support close to current levels. ","3Q highlights EPS outperformance (10%) was driven by a combination of revenue (+2%) and margin outperformance (~300bp). Management highlighted professional services, which can be lumpy, as a specific area of outperformance. Lower T&E drove 200bp of margin tailwind. Both subscription and professional services grew mid to high 20s y/y, which looked consistent with last quarter normalizing for the compare, which also appears to hold true for the F4Q guidance. Billings performance/guide creates confusion. VEEV's bookings can be noisy and this quarter was no exception. 3Q billings ($319mn) grew 24% y/y, after adjusting for changes in customer billing terms ($16mn impact), and outperformed guidance by 2%, below recent trend of ~9%. Despite the F3Q beat, annual billings guidance was held constant at +22%, normalized for the change in billing terms and 4Q billings guidance ($794mn) implies 15% y/y growth including some modest distortion ($10mn/150bp) due to timing of renewals. The smaller than trend F3Q billings outperformance combined with implied deceleration in F4Q was a key focal point in the follow-up Q&A. While this billings confusion will likely remain an overhang near-term, our bottom-up model suggests bookings guidance supports at least management's initial FY23 revenue guidance (17-18%) or perhaps closer to 24% using historical revenue retention rates. We also note that the company has outperformed initial guidance by 7-8% the past three years. Key elements of initial FY2023 (Jan) guidance Subscription revenue growth of 17-18% and professional services growth of 15-17%, which was below consensus of 20% and 15%, respectively. Management previously indicated that they expect a 10% reduction in pharma sales reps (industry-wide) by the end of FY24 (Jan) with the majority of the reductions over the course of FY23. We estimate these reductions equate to a $50mn annual revenue headwind at completion, which implies ~150bp headwind to revenue growth in both FY23 and FY24 if reductions are ratable.

CLVT US,CLVT,Dec 27 2021 02:57PM,Clarivate Analytics Plc,Business & Information Services,Not Spreading Holiday Cheer: Restatement Required for Legacy CPA Equity; Lowering Target Price to $29 ,"This morning, CLVT issued an 8K stating that the company discovered an accounting error relatedto equity awards that CPA Global had issued under its equity plan. The timing of this discovery is poor, less than a month after the prior CFO left, though we are told that the items are not related, and this error was discovered in the last week. This error should not impact Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted FCF, but it is likely to impact the GAAP EBITDA and earnings, and the reported FCF. Our thesis is predicated on multiple expansion through sentiment improvement when the company achieves its organic growth targets, and we expect the 4Q21 earnings report to be a catalyst for share appreciation. That being said, we expect less sentiment improvement than before and are lowering our target price to $29 (peer-level valuation would imply $34). ","This morning, CLVT issued an 8K stating that the company discovered an accounting error related to equity awards that CPA Global had issued under its equity plan. These equity awards were converted to CLVT stock in conjunction with the CPA Global acquisition. CLVT had accounted for the stock as part of acquisition accounting, and the company recently discovered that this was an error and that the majority of the stock should be accounted for as stock-based compensation. CLVT will need to restate the 2020 10K, and the 10Qs for the first three periods in 2021 to account for this error, and this could result in an additional expense of up to $185M. The timing of this discovery is poor (not that there is ever a good time for an accounting error...), less than a month after the prior CFO left, though we are told that the items are not related, and this error was discovered in the last week. Apparently, the company sold the employee stock and made significant cash payments with the proceeds, which prompted a review of the accounting for the process. This error should not impact Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted FCF, but it is likely to impact the GAAP EBITDA and earnings, and the GAAP FCF. Adjusted EBITDA and EPS shouldn't change since CLVT already excludes stock comp expense from its adjusted numbers. Reported FCF (not Adjusted FCF) should be lower since CLVT recognizes the sales of stock through the financing section of the cash flow statement, but pays the employees through payroll which goes through cash from operations. We understand this will result in a quarterly increase in stock based compensation through October 2022, and another cash payment in 4Q22, though the larger vesting is the October 2021 tranche that just occurred. Our thesis is predicated on multiple expansion through sentiment improvement when the company achieves its organic growth targets, and we expect the 4Q21 earnings report to be a catalyst for share appreciation. We expect CLVT to have issued its restated financials by the time the company reports its earnings for 4Q21 at the end of the February (estimated reporting time), so we don’t expect a lack of historical statements to be an issue. That being said, the company expects to report an additional material weakness in internal controls when it files its 10K, and having to restate financial statements and noting material weakness in financial controls are not exactly sentiment boosters in investors eyes. We are lowering our target price from $32 to $29, reflecting a 3-turn EV/2022 EBITDA valuation discount to the Info Services peer group, when considering the combined CLVT and ProQuest 2022 estimated EBITDA. A peer-level multiple would imply a $34 valuation all else remaining equal, BUT given that 1) our recommendation is based on sentiment improvement (not expecting significant changes to estimates), 2) the company is having to restate its financials for an accounting error and issue a material financial weakness disclosure, and 3) there is still significant private equity ownership overhang with the potential to distribute additional shares into the market, we believe a several-turn discount to peers is warranted.",Shlomo H.

CROX US,CROX,Dec 26 2021 08:37PM,"Crocs, Inc.",Sports and Lifestyle Brands,Crocs Diversifies Beyond Clogs with $2.5bn Acquisition of HEYDUDE ,"The $2.5bn acquisition of HEYDUDE gives CROX an additional a fast-growing casual footwearfranchise. Crocs management has proven adept at scaling a digitally-centric youthful casual footwear brand, and we see strategic and platform synergies to growth and margin. At approximately 15X EBITDA, the transaction is slightly EV/EBITDA dilutive but accretive to growth, margin, and earnings, in our view. We appreciate the HEYDUDE product line for bringing added versatility and diversifying CROX beyond dependence on the clog silhouette. The transaction, however, adds a secondary dimension of fashion exposure to fickle young U.S. consumers and brings net leverage to approximately 3.0X proforma EBITDA. Street revenue and earnings will likely move higher though a proforma view of EV/EBITDA implies risk/reward remains largely in balance. Our 12 mos. target of $157 represents an 11.2x EV/proforma FY22 EBITDA (assumes $203mn acquired EBITDA, $2.05bn additional debt, and approximately 2.9mn additional shares). ","What happened: Crocs, last Wednesday before the market open, announced the acquisition of casual footwear brand HEYDUDE for $2.5bn valuing the business at less than 15X EBITDA (compared to CROX at 13.3X prior to the announcement). HEYDUDE, founded in Italy in 2008, sells accessibly priced comfortable shoes to men, women, and children through a multi- channel distribution strategy. While dilutive to the EBITDA multiple, HEYDUDE is expected to be immediately accretive to revenue growth, margin and earnings, while generating free cash flow. In 2021, HEYDUDE more than doubled to $570mn revenue and Crocs projects the business to reach $700-$750mn in 2022E (+23-32% y/y), and at least $1bn by 2024E (at least a 21% 3-yr. CAGR from 2021E). Operating margins are greater than 26% currently and expected to be >26% long term. The deal is expected to close in 1Q22 (around late February), subject to customary closing conditions, and will be funded by $2.05bn cash and $450mn shares. CROX is expected to enter into a $2.0bn Term Loan B Facility and borrow $50mn under the revolver to help fund cash considerations. We project pro-forma net leverage to approximately 3.0X trailing EBITDA. Importantly, Crocs remains “incredibly optimistic” the FY26 organic financial targets for $5bn revenue (17% CAGR) and 26%+ operating margin. With the acquired HEYDUDE business, the total 2026E targets are now $6bn+ sales (20%+ CAGR), and 26%+ operating margin. The previously announced repurchases of 8.1mn shares in 2021E, including $500mn in 4Q21, have reportedly been completed. Why it matters: HEYDUDE brings another fast-growing, high-momentum, U.S.-centric casual footwear business with immediate accretion to growth, margins, and earnings. The brand generates approximately 95% of revenue in the U.S. market with approximately 43% of revenue through digital DTC. HEYDUDE’s casual appeal is strongest in the South and Midwest and the customer base reportedly has high overlap with the Crocs consumer. The acquisition provides diversification in the product portfolio away from the Classic Clog (clog mix of 71% 2021E goes to 57% proforma) but adds a secondary dimension of trendy footwear exposure to the fickle young U.S. consumers. The outlook for $700-$750mn HEYDUDE sales in 2022E suggests $0.73-$0.90 accretion on proforma annual basis. We will update estimates when the transaction closes early in FY22. With the addition of HEYDUDE, Street revenue and numbers will likely go higher and so too will balance sheet leverage (to approximately 3.0X proforma).",Jim Duffy,"Jim Duffy;Peter McGoldrick, CFA",157,,Hold,-,USD,10.36,,,,,,2.78B,,,,,STIFEL_CROX_CoNote_2021-12-26.pdf,CROX_CoNote_2021-12-26,,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=10a507c4-4117-4eaf-b2a0-7e482b8e905d&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

This morning before the market open, MTSI announced that it had completed the sale of its equity interest in Ampere Computing Holdings LLC for $127.7mn in cash to Denver Acquisition Corp., one of Ampere’s LLC members and an affiliate of Oracle Corp. As areminder, Ampere was formed through the October 2017 divestiture of MTSI’s ARM- based compute processor and non-communications workload processor businesses (which MTSI itself had acquired through its January 2017 purchase of AMCC). Included in the LLC agreement (as amended and restated) that created Ampere was a call option that allowed for this transaction at a previously negotiated price.

According to the 8-K filed in conjunction with this announcement, MTSI’s ownership stake in Ampere was less than 10%, which had a carrying value of $12.8mn as of October 1, 2021. As a result, we expect MTSI to record a gain of approximately $114.9mn in its December 2021 quarter results.

Coupled with the company’s robust FCF generation (TTM FCF of $130.5mn), we believe MTSI will enter 2022 in the strongest financial position in more than eight years, as the September 2013 quarter was the last time the company recorded both positive net cash and positive TTM FCF.

Many of its equity peers trade at their tightest discount levels in years; this is not the case for LGI. In addition to its discount, we find shares of LGI as attractive due to its global portfolio and high distributions. The fund employs a managed distribution policy. We generally recommend shares of LGI only to investors with high risk tolerance because of its use of leverage. Leverage can greatly magnify the volatility of funds, especially in equity funds.

DSV DC,DSV,Dec 14 2021 06:11AM,DSV A/S,Transportation,‘Don't stop the music’ ,"We believe the disappointing performance in 4Q21 presents an attractive entryopportunity as the selling is based on false premises, in our view. @ We are 5% ahead of FY21e EBIT consensus and believe the company will grow its EBIT by 7.4% CAGR between 2021-25 and not see negative growth in any year. e In our view, the Agility GIL (AGIL) integration is on track to be completed by 2H22, just in time for a potential DB Schenker bid. ","This note should be read in conjunction with our sector note - European Logistics: No such thing as ""pre-crisis"" margins Attractive entry opportunity: We believe the drop in the share price that started at the end of September was triggered by an alleged 50% drop in spot ocean freight rates and prolonged by reports that Maersk will rescind services to freight forwarders. As described in more detail in the sector note, we believe both arguments are flawed. In our view, there was never a 50% drop in spot ocean freight rates. The only freight rate provider that reported a marked drop for a single trade lane (Transpacific) is Freightos, which includes premium rates in its assessment, a tiny fragment of the market that is of little importance to DSV. With respect to Maersk, it is our understanding that Maersk intends to increase slot allocations to shippers, which can be framed as shunning forwarders as reported by some outlets. From a commercial perspective, it is more likely that Maersk will continue to serve large forwarders (like DSV) at the expense of smaller players. As described in our sector note, we believe that freight rates will be higher for longer and forwarders will increase (and not lose) market share in the post-pandemic environment. Therefore, we conclude that the disappointing 4Q21 performance is unjustified and an attractive entry opportunity. Earnings outlook: We believe DSV will beat consensus EBIT estimates for FY21, due on 9 February, by ~5% as very high air freight rates exceed expectations. Thereafter, we see EBIT growing by 6% in FY22e, partially due to the AGIL acquisition, before momentum slows down to 4% in FY23e. Crucially, consensus estimates for FY23 EBIT differ markedly, with the top end at DKK20bn twice the low end at DKK10bn. While we feel comfortable in the upper third of the range at ~DKK18bn (3% ahead of the average estimate), the broad range of estimates highlights that freight rates still play an outsized role and obscure almost DKK3bn in FY23e EBIT contribution from AGIL and DKK2bn in road (once Road Way Forward project is up), which makes it unlikely that DSV will revisit FY20 EBIT levels of a little less than DKK10bn. DB Schenker Option: While we were sceptical at first (link), the new German government seems to be willing to initiate restructuring of Deutsche Bahn that includes divesting DB Schenker. Admittedly, the coalition paper reads differently as it states that the integrated structure of Deutsche Bahn will be maintained, but several members of the coalition parties went on record saying this guarantee only applies to Deutsche Bahn's core business according to Deutsche Presse Agentur. Importantly, this includes the SPD's Mr Soren Bartol, the party that was most opposed to breaking up Deutsche Bahn, who said that they will examine a possible sale of individual shareholdings. In addition, the Deutsche Bahn labor union, EVG, also went on record saying that ""the sale of DB Schenker is not a red line"" (Handelsblatt), which is starkly different from their stance a couple of years ago when their opposition to a sale prompted the SPD to block it during the previous grand-coalition government. DSV has already expressed interest in bidding for DB Schenker and we maintain our view that it would be a good fit.",Marc Zeck,"Marc Zeck, CFA;Johannes Braun, CFA, CIIA",1740,,Buy,,DKK,50.6,,53.2,,7.49,7.98,,,,,M,STIFEL_'Don't stop_CoNote_Dec 14 2021 06-11AM.pdf,STIFEL_'Don't stop_CoNote_Dec 14 2021 06-11AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=3480a7e7-cab6-4d70-b576-642be4a19ab4&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
MAERSKB DC,MAERSKB,Dec 14 2021 06:11AM,AP Moeller Maersk,Transportation,"‘Steady, as she goes' - reiterate Buy ","We stick to our Buy rating as we believe the market is too pessimistic on FY23freight rates and underestimates the protection provided by Maersk's above- average share of contract rates. e Our FY23 EBITDA estimate is +17% ahead of consensus estimates as the market believes that Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd will face a similar decline in earnings despite the former's high share of contract rates. e@ Maersk's combined FCF for FY21e and FY22e stands at ~50% of its market cap, while its FCF yield for FY23e still reaches 16%. At ~3x FY23e EV/EBITDA on our estimates, it trades at a significant discount vs. peers, which is partly due to its “integrator” strategy being misunderstood, in our view. ","This note should be read in conjunction with our sector note - European Logistics: No such thing as ""pre-crisis"" margins FY23 freight rate concerns overblown: As detailed in our sector note, we believe there is little scope for a significant retreat in freight rates in FY22 or FY23 as the three major bottlenecks, vessel capacity, infrastructure (port) capacity and labor (trucking) capacity are unlikely to improve materially. With respect to vessel capacity, we believe the current order book might balance the market in FY24 at the earliest (as new deliveries are broadly split between FY23 and FY24) and only if bottlenecks are resolved, if vessel utilisation remains at depressed levels, if scrapping remains at all-time lows, if environmental regulation doesn't affect older vessels and if carriers don't engage in capacity management. There are a lot of ""ifs"", which is why we believe being ""conservative"" means the base case shouldn't feature pre-pandemic rate levels by FY23 as estimated by the most bearish forecasts on the street. Contract rates should offer some protection: We believe Maersk's high share of contract rates should offer some cushion against declining spot freight rates, which should be reflected in earnings estimates for Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd (which has a significantly lower share of contract rates). We believe this is not yet the case as on average Maersk's EBITDA is expected to decline by -46% from FY21 to FY23 vs. -53% for Hapag-Lloyd. We believe the spread should be higher and subsequently model -36% for Maersk and -57% for Hapag-Lloyd. Our FY23 EBITDA estimate of $14.7bn is ~17% ahead of consensus estimates. Valuation and relative performance still highly attractive In FY21e, Maersk has sharply underperformed its peers who, on average, appreciated by 200% vs. 60% for Maersk if measured in Euros and including dividends. Consequently, Maersk's FY23e FCF yield of 16% and FY23e EV/EBITDA of ~3.3x remain highly attractive compared with its peers. We believe the discount partly reflects doubts about Maersk's ""integrator"" strategy, which remains poorly understood as documented by press articles that continue to link Maersk to M&A activity in the freight forwarding space. We believe that Maersk's strategy is quite the opposite. Rather than establishing another freight forwarder, Maersk is trying to obtain a larger share of the wallet vs. in-house logistics regardless of what freight forwarders are doing.

VOW3 GY,VOW3,Nov 04 2021 01:30AM,Volkswagen AG,Automotive,+72% YTD: VW ords could be a great acquisition currency in a Porsche AG IPO ,"VW ords outperform VW prefs significantly, the spread is at peak levels - for no obviousreason. The Prosche/Piech family indirectly owns VW ords. We discussed in our Porsche SE initiation a structure that would allow the family to buy back Porsche AG shares in an IPO with the proceeds from the sale of VW ords. Several media reports said that this is indeed a discussion among stakeholders. We do not know where this discussion stands. However, due to the significant increase in the VW ordinary share price (+72% YTD), buying Porsche AG shares and paying with VW ords became significantly more attractive. If it happens, all share classes involved should benefit - among them, we contend VW prefs should benefit most. ","VW ords at peak premium: The ordinary shares traded at a small EUR1.35 average premium in Jan 2017-March 2020. Yesterday, the spread closed at EUR106. The free float in VW ords is small, but the total number of shares is huge, VW has 206m preference shares but 295m ordinary shares, i.e. the market capitalization is driven by the VW ords. Who is paying EUR100 premium? The out-performance started in March 2020, by coincidence about when CEO Diess started buying VW ords for EUR50k every month. (Question to Mr Diess for the next conference call: why do you keep buying the VW ords at EUR100 premium?). While the free float in VW ords is small, the volume that Mr Diess is buying is far too low to explain the out- performance. So, who else is buying VW ords? A popular view is that it could be US retail investors who are buying ADRs that are based on VW ords. Or an activist building up a small stake and potentially pools interest with Qatar (which owns 17% of the voting rights). Both are speculation, and we have no evidence of it. What are the implications? We do not know why the ords are rising, but we know who benefits: the biggest holder of VW ords is PAH SE; and this entity is 50% owned by the Porsche/Piech family (see Figure 2 of this report). We discussed a scenario in the past that included VW doing a partial IPO of Porsche AG and the family buying into that, financed with the sale of VW ordinary shares. In this case, VW ords would be an acquisition currency - and it has appreciated significantly. Even if the family wanted Porsche SE to keep 50% voting rights in VW, the 3.3% of the VW ords would be worth some EUR2.5bn at the current price. Who would buy VW ords from the family at that price? The State of Lower Saxony could be interested in increasing its stake closer to 25% (they own 20% of the votes). That would secure a blocking minority at Lower Saxony's biggest employer - even in case the rule that gives the state blocking minority at 20% would be removed. Conclusion: The Prosche/Piech family's end game is not clear. However, if a Porsche IPO in combination with the sale of VW ords is one of the options, this path became significantly more attractive for the family, and thus we think more likely. It is not part of our VW target price, but Porsche IPO could imply incremental upside to all share classes involved. However, VW prefs should benefit most, as we think the spread seems unsustainably high and should normalize over time. | Figure 1 - Absolute spread between VW ords/VW prefs reached a historic peak - for no obvious reason ART VASES SS | be OO ceoDess sans buying Words be EURSOK per month 72S XN c} FEE KAS el et ee ht Pye PPP Pye MP Source: Refinitiv",Daniel Schwarz,"Daniel Schwarz;Pierre-Yves Quémeéner;Alexander Wahl, CFA",308,,Buy,,EUR,29.9,,34.7,,8.36,10.4,,,,,M,STIFEL_+72% YTD-_CoNote_Nov 04 2021 01-30AM.pdf,STIFEL_+72% YTD-_CoNote_Nov 04 2021 01-30AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=ee380a54-9994-4c84-a78e-ffe2ea668e34&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
CFR SW,CFR,Nov 04 2021 02:00AM,Richemont,Consumer Goods,1H22 results preview - Jewellery powerhouse; focus on Asia-Pac & YNAP ,"Richemont reports 1H22 results on November 12 with a call at 9:30am CET. Weexpect further top line strength and remarkable profitability for the all-important Jewellery Maisons along with gradual improvement for Specialist Watchmakers to offset mixed performances for Online Distributors and Other Maisons. Firing on the one cylinder that matters. A buoyant US jewellery market, sequential improvement in Europe and strong brand momentum for Cartier should have mitigated slowing jewellery growth in Asia during the summer as recently flagged by LVMH for Bvigari. We expect Jewellery Maisons (JM) sales in the first half to have been 41% above 2019 levels, which creates upside risks to 1H22 consensus JM margins thanks to favourable operating leverage dynamics. Investor focus areas. Investors should be focused on exit growth rates (especially in Asia-Pacific), the state of the Chinese consumer (given the more uncertain macro and property market backdrop), the sustainability of US demand (with the phase-out of government stimulus), gross margin/opex inflation outlook comments and an update on YNAP regarding its progress to become a hybrid platform to be shared with other parties. Richemont remains a core holding for offering the industry's best jewellery asset (Cartier), an attractive watches portfolio and a leading presence in Asia. These positives are offset by perennial losses at Other Maisons and unattractive economics at YNAP. A potential upside risk for the stock would be corporate activity involving YNAP, which has been a drag to the group's operational performance and has diluted an attractive hard luxury equity story, in our view. ","Expectations by division Jewellery Maisons. We forecast +28% sales growth at CER in 2Q22 (+37% two-year vs. +43% in 1Q22). The historical regression line versus LVMH Watches & Jewellery (R2 = 94%) points to c.25% organic growth in 2Q22 for Richemont Jewellery Maisons. However, relative to Bvigari, Richemont should have benefited from Cartier's good exposure to a buoyant US market (as illustrated by very strong credit card jewellery spending data) and a stronger e-commerce presence in China (helped by a well- established presence on Tmall) to mitigate the impact from COVID restrictions during the summer. In addition, LVMH W&J organic performance in Q3 does not incorporate Tiffany's remarkable growth in the US. From a brand heat perspective, key highlights for Cartier include accelerating momentum on Google Trends and YouTube views. Strong operating leverage should have fueled strong profitability for Jewellery Maisons (we model 33.8% broadly in-line with 33.5% consensus). We model stable 33.4% JM margins in the FY23-26E period Specialist Watchmakers. We model +25% y-o-y growth at CER in 2Q22 (+5% two-year vs. +7% in 1Q22). This is consistent with Swiss watch exports figures above 2019 levels in calendar Q3 for the >CHF3000 and CHF500-3000 export price segments in which Richemont competes. We forecast 14.0% margin in 1H22 broadly in-line with consensus. Online Distributors. We model +8% y-o-y growth at CER in 2Q22 (+12% two-year vs. +8% in 1Q22). Website traffic trends for YNAP have remained soft, with Farfetch making further inroads relative to competition, we think. Investor focus should be on action plans under-way to move YNAP to a hybrid model. Group 1H22 headline figures: we model €8.63b sales (+21% two-year growth) and €1.47bn operating profit (17.0% margin), not dissimilar from consensus.",Rogerio Fujimori,Rogerio Fujimori,122,,Hold,,EUR,3.49,,4.14,,2,2.64,,,,,M,STIFEL_1H22 results_CoNote_Nov 04 2021 02-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_1H22 results_CoNote_Nov 04 2021 02-00AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=d6cf5e45-8fb5-4fe5-bdcd-c563caedfd0b&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
CRH ID,CRH,Dec 01 2021 01:00AM,CRH PLC,Construction,2022 - Driven By Pricing Power & M&A ,"2022 should be a good year for the Group given its strong pricing power. That said,the U.S. stimulus is unlikely to drive volumes until the end of the year. e Corporate development/M&A should become an important driver in 2022 given the Group's financial strength. e Froma sector relative perspective, we expect the stock to continue its outperformance in the very short-term. That said, its European peers, such as Holcim (HOLN SW, Buy, CHF44.45), should take over in due course. e CRH's valuation supports further upside into 2022, but unlike its European peers this seems to be relatively limited. The stock could break the €50 level, but would then be pushing beyond our new PT of €48.50. ","2022 - A Good Year In Terms Of Pricing, But Less So For Volumes CRH probably has the best geographic footprint, when it comes to capacity utilisation. The U.S., the UK, Switzerland, Poland and most other Eastern Europe have utilsations close to ~80%. We estimate that ~85% of the Group's geographic EBITDA exposure faces tight supply in context of steady demand. Overall, the Group's capacity utilisation and well- structured markets should provide significant pricing power in 2022. High- to mid- single digit price increases should hence be possible. Price increases have already been announced for 2022, but more might be possible as the year progresses. This is important to compensate for the higher input costs, especially in terms of energy and CO, costs. When it comes to volumes, we are more cautious for the Group given that the US stimulus should only start to kick in from late 2022, while its exposure to peripheral and Eastern Europe (where most of the EU's stimulus goes) seems limited. Overall, low-single digit volume growth should be a good outcome for the Group in 2022, in our view. Corporate Development/M&A Could Become An Important Driver In 2022 The Group could comfortably invest >USD7bn, in line with previous valuations, and still remain at <2x ND/EBITDA in 2022. In 2021, the Group will have spent at least USD1.4bn on corporate development and M&A. USDO.6bn of this is expansion capex, which should come with lower risk and significantly higher returns. We would expect the Group's overall corporate development/M&A spend to increase significantly and hence drive earnings and returns in 2022. Every USD1bn invested at 7x EV/EBITDA should enhance earnings by ~2-3% and result in a ROIC of ~8%, even before synergies. We expect a focus on its current geographies and products, but also expect to see more deals like Pebble Technology and National Pipe & Plastics, expansions into adjacent products with important synergy and solutions characteristics. In terms of size, we would not be surprised to see larger bolt-ons as well. An Ash Grove-type deal (USD3.5bn) could now be described as a larger bolt-on. If all else fails, the Group can still continue or increase its ongoing share buy-back or rebase the dividend once more. Some Valuation Upside In 2022, But Less Than Its European Peers Overall, we see ~13% upside potential for CRH, which compares to >30% for its European peers on average, when using our four-pronged valuation methodology. We particularly like Holcim at 5.2x 22E EV/EBITDA. At 8.2x 22E (pre IFRS16) EV/EBITDA, we believe CRH's stock still has some upside to its 30-year median at close to 9x. We contend It has most upside, if the re-rated 1.5x EV/Sales holds into 2022. That said, the Group needs to work harder on its returns to get a bigger uplift, in our view. The EV/IC at 1.5x 22E is in line with historical levels, as is its ROIC at ~10% 22E. The uplift in our price target is relatively less than our earnings upgrade given our slightly more generous valuation before.",Tobias Woerner,Tobias Woerner,48.5,47.5,Buy,,USD,3.13,,3.37,,1.39,1.43,,,,,M,STIFEL_2022 -_CoNote_Dec 01 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_2022 -_CoNote_Dec 01 2021 01-00AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=b9589cd1-b44c-4eea-babb-42da65e26d0c&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
HEI GY,HEI,Dec 03 2021 01:00AM,HeidelbergCement AG,Building Materials,2022 - Flexing Its Pricing Power? ,"2022 should be a fairly good year in terms of pricing for HeidelbergCementhelped by high capacity utilisations and well-structured markets. Good exposure to Europe, Asia-Pacific and Africa should drive volumes ahead of its peers, supported by stimulus packages and further normalisation. e@ M&A should continue on both the divestment and acquisition front. Although the Command Alkon deal has raised eyebrows, we liked the Tanzania deal. Divestments of less attractive positions continue successfully. The Group's balance sheet is in the strongest position in decades, allowing for further optionality around acquisitions and shareholder returns, in our view. e We find the valuation is now one of the most attractive in its 30-year history and now discounts disproportional Green capex. Unless the Group fails to move on the ESG side or makes further off-piste acquisitions, then we would expect a sharp rebound in the not-too-distant future. We re-iterate our Buy rating with a PT of 0 EBRD ","2022 - Expect Strong Pricing & Above Average Peer Volume Growth Around two-thirds of the Group's capacities now have domestic capacity utilisation in the ~80% range. North America, Eastern Europe, the Nordics and the UK are markets where tight supply meets steady or strong demand. Markets such as Germany, France and others should benefit from supportive regional market structures. Price increases in these markets may move into significant double-digit territory. On average, the Group should hence see mid- to high-single digit price increases in 2022. Given what electricity and fuel prices are doing this is needed, but should allow the price cost spread to expand again into H2-22. In terms of volumes, we expect the Group to deliver above average peer growth. Some 70-75% of its exposure should benefit from either continued normalisation or the early impact from stimulus next year. Europe (40% of EBITDA) should benefit from the EU's Next Generation Recovery Plan, while Asia-Pacific and Africa-Eastern Mediterranean Basin (19% and 13%, respectively) are seeing a delayed and positive opening-up impact. The latest motorway traffic data look particularly reassuring for these markets (see Figure 4). Our 2022 adjusted EBITDA estimate of €3,963m compares to Visible Alpha consensus at €3,893m. M&A Should Remain An Important Driver In 2022 The Group has been pretty active in terms of M&A in 2021. We liked the pricey North American West divestment, the Tanzania acquisition and the latest Spanish and Sierra Leone divestments. The Command Alkon deal was off-piste, and we would hope that the Group stays within its remit in the future. The long and short of it is that the Group now has the strongest balance sheet in its 30-year history (at <1x 22E ND/EBITDA). This increases optionality around M&A, while a share buy-back is already under way (€1bn to be completed by Sep-23). Maybe investors should hope for a significant rebasing of the dividend or a one-off special dividend? The Most Attractive Valuation Upside In Its History? The stock's valuation is now one of the most attractive in its history, in our view. At 4.6x 22E EV/EBITDA (pre IFRS16) there is now >60% potential upside to its long- term median of 7.5x. To put this into perspective, the Group could spend €10bn on Green capex and still only be fairly valued. This appears disproportional, in our view. The dividend yield at ~4.3% 22E should also not be ignored, especially as this compares with its long-term median at 1.6%.",Tobias Woerner,Tobias Woerner,85,,Buy,,EUR,7.75,,8.3,,2.45,2.61,,,,,M,STIFEL_2022 -_CoNote_Dec 03 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_2022 -_CoNote_Dec 03 2021 01-00AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=7921ebe5-a223-40ac-8b47-316fe29e953e&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
IFX GY,IFX,Nov 10 2021 02:21AM,Infineon,Technology Hardware,2022 margin guidance slightly raised as pricing power keeps unfolding ,"Post a stronger-than-expected margin in FYQ4-21 (and guidance for FYQ1-22), IFX todayraises its 2022 margin guidance to 21% from 20%. Sales in the next FY are still seen at €12.7bn (midpoint), close to the guidance given at its CMD in October (€12.65bn). This is confirmation that IFX is executing on pricing power, especially with automotive customers. We see the case as unchanged and reiterate our Buy rating. ","e@ Strong Q4 margin in Auto & PSS: IFX reported final Q4-2021 sales of €3bn with segment profit of €616m (20.5% margin), beating (Vara) consensus estimates by 10% on segment profit (€558m, 19.0% margin). The earnings beat comes from the Auto & PSS divisions. FCF in Q4 was €378m, net debt decreased to €2.7bn end-September. High Q1 margin triggers a margin guidance increase for 2022E: IFX confirms the sales guidance that was announced at the CMD in October, with sales of €12.7bn (previously: growing mid teens to €12.65bn). However, the segment profit margin is now seen at 21% (old: 20%). Consensus is looking at 14.4% sales growth (to €12.6bn) and 19.8% margin, implying consensus profit estimate increases by 7%. Details are shown in Chart 1. Capex is still guided at €2.4bn and FCF at €1bn. Q1 guidance calls for sales of €3bn with a segment profit margin of 21% (€630m). This compares with consensus at €2.97bn/562m (18.9% margin), a 12% beat at the segment profit level. We expect consensus estimates to move up further post final results today as IFX executes on pricing power. Capacity planning: IFX in the past indicated that it needs to make a decision soon on where to build its next greenfield fab.

BVI FP,BVI,Dec 03 2021 02:42AM,Bureau Veritas,Business Services,2025 targets in line with expectations ,"Bureau Veritas announced its 2025 targets ahead of its investor day this morning.Targets are broadly in line with our expectations, targeting mid-single-digit organic growth p.a., and to maintain a margin above 16%. We acknowledge that consensus is more bullish in terms of margin expansion, which could be revised downwards, implying a marginal 2-3% cut to consensus adj. EBIT sequence. Nevertheless, we believe that investor focus was on BVI's ability to demonstrate sustainable growth. We expect the conference today to provide more colour on the growth initiatives, whether organic or external. Overall, including M&A, we expect the company to deliver 5-7% revenue growth p.a. In addition, we appreciate the group's communication is now prudent by nature, and we thus assume these financial targets are rather on the conservative side. ","Sustainable organic growth. The group targets mid-single-digit organic growth, in line with consensus expectations. Returning to comparable normative levels of growth vs peers had been one of the major catalysts in our view for a re-rating. We thus find that this guidance backs BVI's valuation. The >16% AOP margin guidance is not surprising in our view, but may disappoint consensus. Consensus expects a continuous margin improvement y/y over the next five years, to reach c.17% in 2025E (Visible Alpha, 9 contributions out of 16). We are more cautious as we expect BVI to focus on growth initiatives, which will require additional operating investments. In addition, we expect the Building & Infrastructure segment (29% of sales) to drive the growth, with a slightly dilutive mix effect on the group's profitability. Continued prudent M&A strategy. The group guides as expected for a disciplined and selective bolt-on M&A strategy. However, the group does not provide a specific quantitative target for M&A, it states that the use of FCF from operations will be balanced between capex, M&A and dividends. The capex guidance remains 2.5-3.0% of sales p.a., and the dividend payout stays at c.50% of adj. net income. Assuming balanced growth investments vs shareholder returns, based on our forecasts, we estimate that implies c.€100m M&A firepower p.a. and could add c.+2% external growth p.a. Cyber-attack update: improving but not over yet. The firm disclosed yesterday that to date, some regions still have IT systems impacted. However, they note that all the group’s business were able to continue operating, o/w >80% are back to a normal level as of today. Finally, they expect to recover most of the delayed activities within short period of time. Overall, we still expect the negative impacts to be contained to Q4-21.

TYRES FH,TYRES,Nov 03 2021 02:00AM,Nokian Renkaat,Automotive,3Q21 earnings: significant beat on pulled forward volumes ,"We lift our EPS sequence by c.11% through 2023 and raise our target c.6% to€32.25. e Nokian reported a 3Q21 adjusted EBIT of €96.9m (+34% ahead of consensus) as consumer tire volumes soared (+26%). According to CEO comments, these were ""partially driven by early timing of deliveries"". e On a more negative note, price-mix (+1.4%) remains subdued, as the mix deteriorated (regional, segment and product line), offsetting more than three- quarters of the price increases (+6.6% in the quarter). e Current multiples (c. 40%/45% premium, on an average, in 2022/2023; cf. Exhibit 2) fairly capture the group's short- to medium-term prospects, as Nokian expands into territories that are currently the stronghold of larger industry participants. ","3Q21 adjusted EBIT was a 34% beat to consensus expectations Adjusted EBIT reached €96.9m in 3Q21, driven by strong core consumer division volumes (+26.1% at consumer division) and a particularly supportive ""supply chain"" which provided a €17m tailwind in the quarter (vs -€9m in 3Q20). Price-Mix was rather subdued, as a negative mix (regions, segments and lines) offset more than three- quarters of the positive pricing (+6.6%). We understand that the main drag on mix was Russia (lower ASP) together with a higher share of in All-season,/Summer vs more profitable Winter products. Currency has mostly been neutral in the quarter (more details in Exhibit 6). +26% volume growth in the 3Q21 is probably not sustainable Nokian reported all-time high third-quarter revenues (+27% vs 3Q20) driven by unexpectedly strong volumes at core consumer division (+26%). The Group mentioned that 3Q has been helped by ""early deliveries"" as many dealers have feared not having enough products in a broader context of low inventories. Russia (+121%) has obviously been the key driver, on depleted comps, but Nordics (+11%) and Central Europe (+23%), on more normal 2020 bases, have also been solid. Volumes normalising; cost rising going forward Management have refrained to quantify volume trends for the last quarter after a staggering (and somewhat ""pulled forward"") third quarter. While a volume reversal (aka slight negative) cannot be ruled out, we have modeled a positive but fading dynamic in 4Q21 (+4.5% on Russia, Nafta) before an expected normalisation in 2022/2023 (+1%/ +4% respectively). As for price mix, we have assumed a more favourable situation into the next three quarters (stable negative mix/higher pricing on recent hikes) which, however, should be insufficient to fully offset cost inflation before 3Q22. Prospects for 2022-23 are fairly reflected at current share price levels On our revised earnings, the group trades at a 40%/45% premium to peers (Stifel coverage) on our usual three metrics (EV/Sales, EV/Ebit and P/E) which is close to its 15-year 48% average (cf. Exhibit 2). We appreciate the solid performance in the past two quarters but on unsustainably high volumes. Moreover, the balance of price-mix versus cost inflation could remain negative for another two to three quarters.

On the positive side, the group is maintaining its full-year margin guidance at 2.8% and targets positive FCF ex-WCR impact (the overall outcome should probably be less flattering as we fear overall WCR absorption). e@ CarCo drivers were : -20% on volumes, +2.99% on pricing, which is lower than in the previous two quarters, on the back of high comps (3Q20 basis) and ""by lower price increases in emerging markets in the absence of negative exchange rate effects"". Lastly, the group enjoyed a positive tailwind on the restatement of share buyback commitments (+3.7 points). Market outlook revised: Europe seen flat for the FY (vs +10% previously), LatAm +10% (vs +15% previously). Call started at 7:45 CET. Conclusion: reaction at opening should be mixed given comments on low visibility in 4Q (consensus being on the watch out that volume disruption has troughed before looking through into 2022), softer pricing ""which is becoming each quarter more challenging"" according to CFO's comments on the call (+2.9% in 3Q21 vs 4.6% expected by consensus) and comments on positive FCF before WCR impact (last item likely being negative).

CON GY,CON,Nov 15 2021 01:00AM,Continental AG,Automotive Supplier,3Q21 model update: trough volumes and trough sentiment ,"We update our model post 3Q21 results and lower our 2021E group adj. EBIT byc.6% while we leave 2022/23E estimates broadly unchanged. Our price target rises slightly to €119 (from €114). e In our opinion, CON remains one of the less liked suppliers to play an upcoming volume recovery due to its many moving parts and low visibility on costs. Yet, we argue that the combination of near-trough sentiment and earnings offers recovery potential both for earnings and multiples as volumes improve and excess costs reverse on normalizing supply chains. ","It's all about costs CON's 3Q21 final results and earnings call provided little incremental detail vs the pre- release (see note) in October. CON sees 3Q as the trough in terms of semiconductor shortages, and we argue the supply chain situation should gradually improve from here. The implied 4Q21 guidance for Automote Technologies (AT) is as broad as a barn door (implied margin of -9.3% to -5.8% at the low/high-end) due to limited call-off visibility, and we understand the implied significant margin drop in AT in 4Q (-7.5% at the midpoint) vs. 3Q (-4.1% if adjusted for the €60m Vitesco one-off) mainly reflects a sequential increase in semi prices. This would imply that higher semi prices could represent a sequential cost headwind of >€100m (around 300bps) in 4Q and could also turn into a significant burden, specifically in 1H22 and if CON does not reach a cost-sharing agreement with OEMs. Estimate changes We lower our 2021E group adj. EBIT forecast by c.6% for this year on higher costs but leave our estimates for 2022/23E broadly unchanged. Our 2022/23E AT estimates rely on the assumptions that excess supply chain costs will normalize through 2022E, gross cost savings of c.€120m can be realized, and that CON is able to limit the incremental net costs from semi price inflation to c€150m in 2022E. Trough volumes coupled with weak sentiment and self-help potential offer earnings and sentiment recovery potential Our impression is that Faurecia and Valeo remain the preferred suppliers in an upcoming volume recovery for their better execution track record (Faurecia) and fewer moving parts. Aside from the obvious volume headwind from reduced light vehicle production, investors struggle with the various cost overruns (incremental ADAS R&D, excess logistics costs and semi-price inflation in AT and raw material headwinds and energy prices in Rubber), limited visibility as to if and when CON will receive compensation for those, and its ability to deliver on promised restructuring benefits. For this reason, earnings and sentiment are near trough levels, in our view, and we argue that improving light vehicle production, the (partial) reversal of excess costs as supply chains normalize, and restructuring benefits provide recovery potential for both. We think investors, meanwhile, see volume headwinds peaking in 3Q/4Q21 and we see interest in suppliers and sector sentiment somewhat improving from low levels. For this reason, we slightly raise our price target to €119 (from €114) on higher target multiples and reiterate Buy. Our €119 price target implies that CON will trade at 12.8x/9.2x EV/adj. EBIT 2022/23E vs 11.9/8.5x currently.",Alexander Wahl,"Alexander Wahl, CFA;Pierre-Yves Quéméner;Daniel Schwarz",119,114,Buy,,EUR,6.07,,8.79,,1.4,2.65,,,,,M,STIFEL_3Q21 model_CoNote_Nov 15 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_3Q21 model_CoNote_Nov 15 2021 01-00AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=3bbaa38c-778b-4d38-8892-2b50b2c0d258&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
PRY IM,PRY,Oct 27 2021 01:00AM,Prysmian,Capital Goods,"3Q21 Preview: Another Sound 3Q Ahead, Top-End of FY21 Guidance Range Within Reach ","We expect Prysmian to release another solid set of 3Q results (due 11 November), withan adj. EBITDA of €249m (+10% YoY, corresponding to a margin of 8.3%). In line with the previous quarter, we expect the Energy division (driven by T&l, OEM & Renewables) to represent the major quarterly driver, while the Projects segment should accelerate in the last part of the year (driven by the submarine business and German Corridors execution). * Based on our current expectations for 3Q, we consider the top-end of the Company’s FY21 guidance range (both for adj. EBITDA and FCF) as feasible. We have fine-tuned our estimates (partly factoring in a higher sales price increase related to the rising price of metals), but with an overall limited revision at adj. EBITDA/FCF level (remaining in the upper part of the guidance range and above Bloomberg-compiled consensus for FCF). * We reiterate our Buy rating on the stock, with a €38.5 price target, providing 18% upside potential. The Group, in our view, is strongly positioned to benefit from Energy Transition, with a projected acceleration in investments both for interconnectors and offshore wind projects (driven by Europe). The US infrastructure plan should give a further boost to end-demand, as most of the Company’s businesses, in our view, are directly or indirectly correlated to the planned step-up in investments. At our target, the stock would be trading at FY22 adj. EV/EBITDA and EV/EBIT multiples of 11.6x and 17.0x, respectively, with a FCF yield of 4.0%. ","Projects: strengthening momentum, stronger order intake ahead? We expect Prysmian’s management to provide upbeat indications on the Projects segment, with projected acceleration starting from 4Q21, driven by the submarine business (also taking into account the new projects expected to be executed during these months, i.e. Turkish Crossing) and German Corridors execution (management recently confirmed that mass production started during the summer, while the recent delays in the permitting process may have an impact in the mid-term). The submarine production capacity should get fully saturated in 2H21 and, based on current visibility, is expected to remain fully saturated in FY22. As a short-term catalyst, we would mention a potentially strong 4Q order intake: the big-size Tyrrhenian Link, plus some other mid-sized projects, should likely be awarded by year-end (and we expect the Group to be well positioned to garner significant share of them). Telecom: short-term newsflow should remain supportive, with an improving business environment and potentially favorable outcome from the European Antidumping procedure... We expect the Telecom business to continue to benefit from a healthy volume rebound, driven by the high-margin US market. In terms of pricing, we believe that both recent indication from management and the outcome of the China Mobile tender (prices up by almost +60% vs. the prior tender) were pointing to an improving business environment, in our view, with prices at least stabilizing going forward. As a potential short-term trigger for the Telecom division, we highlight potentially positive outcome from the European anti-dumping procedure (likely in November, we believe, with the potential introduction of import duties of >30%, to be applied on Chinese imports). Cost inflation and shortages: we expect overall reassuring messages... While 3Q results should show once again the Company’s resilience in the current inflationary environment, we expect management to provide quite reassuring indications for next year, too; the potential additional cost inflation related to energy and labour costs should be manageable overall thanks to further efficiency-enhancing measures and a better pricing environment. The Group has likely been experiencing some shortages and bottlenecks in production in some regions, but with a relatively limited impact on its global operations.",Renato Gargiulo,Renato Gargiulo,38.5,,Buy,,EUR,1.34,,1.66,,0.5,0.5,,,,,M,STIFEL_3Q21 Preview-_CoNote_Oct 27 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_3Q21 Preview-_CoNote_Oct 27 2021 01-00AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=e5c77614-a3a4-40db-bdff-f388b337f0f0&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
TNXT IM,TNXT,Nov 04 2021 02:00AM,Tinexta,Business Services,"3Q21 Preview: Healthy 3Q Ahead, On Track to Achieve FY21 Guidance ","3Q21 Preview: solid 3Q ahead, fully on track to achieve FY21 guidance... We expectTinexta to release an overall sound set of 3Q21 figures (due 10 November), despite the tough comps YoY and typical business seasonality, in our view fully on track to achieve the Company’s FY21 guidance (pointing to sales of approx. €370m, EBITDA of €96m and net debt/EBITDA ratio - on a Ifl basis, not including the recent CertEurope acquisition - of around 2x). We forecast 3Q Group revenues of €83.7m, up by +28.7% YoY, mostly driven by the consolidation of the newly created Cyber Security unit and by a mid-to-high single digit growth YoY for the Digital Trust division. We would highlight that both the Credit Information & Management and the Innovation & Marketing Services segments had particularly tough comps YoY, as 3Q20 benefitted from a strong rebound post-pandemic (with sales up by +39% and +16% YoY respectively), additionally boosted by the effects of the Italian Law Decree no. 23 of 8 April 2020 (so-called “Business Liquidity”), expanding the range of parties benefitting from the guarantees of the Central Fund, at the same time increasing the maximum coverage percentage, thus with a significant increase in cases managed last year. In terms of profitability, 3Q adj. EBITDA should reach around €21m (from €22m in 3Q20), corresponding to a margin of 24.7% (factoring in the dilutive effect of the consolidation of the cyber security activities and lower contribution from the Credit Information & Management and the Innovation & Marketing Services segments). At the bottom line level, we project a 3Q net income of €7.5m, while the net financial position should have decreased to €192m (from €205m as at the end of 1H21), thanks to a strong projected quarterly FCF. ","Closing of the acquisition of 60% of CertEurope announced yesterday... Yesterday, Tinexta announced to have completed the acquisition of 60% of the capital of CertEurope, through its subsidiary InfoCert. All the terms of the transaction were confirmed, and the consideration has been paid by InfoCert in cash. We believe that the deal has a strong strategic rationale (with high potential cross-selling synergies ahead, by leveraging on InfoCert’s extensive product and services offering), based on: 1. strong brand awareness in France; 2. solid relationships with local trade associations (lawyers and notaries) as well as large retail resellers of digital services; 3. authorisations to issue all types of certificates required by the French market. As the local market is still very fragmented (with the top three players holding similar market shares), we see the move as the first step to enter a new high-potential market (France is the second largest European market and is expected to grow by around +23% on average per year over the next few years) but would not rule out further consolidation ahead. More M&A in sight? Following the recently-announced €100m investment by Bregal Milestone for a 16% stake in InfoCert, we believe that the company may be pursuing more M&A deals in the coming months, likely involving the Digital Trust and the Innovation & Marketing Services sectors (with potential bolt-on acquisitions for the Cyber Security division) while, geographically, Spain, France and Germany could be the top priorities. Assuming a net debt/EBITDA ratio of up to 2.5x, we estimate that the company may have additional M&A firepower of >€400m over the next three years (FY22-24). Buy rating reiterated, price target still €49.50 (c.19% potential upside). We reiterate our positive stance on the stock, with a €49.50 price target, implying potential upside of c.19% vs. current market valuation. At our target, the shares would trade at FY22 adj. EV/EBITDA and EV/EBIT multiples of 21.1x and 28.1x respectively, with a FCF yield of 3.1%.",Renato Gargiulo,Renato Gargiulo,49.5,,Buy,,EUR,1.09,,1.26,,0.33,0.38,,,,,M,STIFEL_3Q21 Preview-_FlashCoNote_Nov 04 2021 02-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_3Q21 Preview-_FlashCoNote_Nov 04 2021 02-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=c65a15b7-9af6-4215-9f9b-0490142bdc19&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
KBX GY,KBX,Oct 25 2021 01:03AM,KNORR-BREMSE AG,Automotive Supplier,3Q21 preview: Groundhog Day ,"KBX will release 3Q21 results on November 12. Overall, we expect a significantQoQ deceleration in group 3Q21 EBITDA to €278m vs. €312m in 2Q21 driven by lower than previously expected activity in CVS and ongoing weakness in RVS. With respect to CVS, we believe that higher input costs, component shortages and overall supply chain disruptions weigh on order intake, revenues and EBITDA while RVS continues to suffer from muted activity in public transport due to the harder than expected Covid-19 Delta wave during the summer. Our estimates are roughly 1-2% below consensus estimates, and we believe most of the 3Q21 issues are already priced in. Thus, market participants will likely look for clues on 4Q21 order activity in RVS and supply chain development in CVS in the commentary from the management. See page 2 for more details on our 3Q21 forecasts. ","Significant deceleration in CVS: We expect CVS 3Q21 order intake to drop by -36% QoQ to €680m from €1.1bn (in line with consensus) while revenues will slow to €750m (-2.6% vs. consensus), down -16% QoQ. The anticipated decline is partly explained by an expected fading of Chinese pre-order activity but a significant chunk of the reductions needs to be attributed to the ongoing component shortage and supply chain disruption in the trucking space. Our EBITDA estimate of €110m is in line with consensus estimates. |tis Groundhog Day in RVS: After a weak start to the year and a disappointing half-time result, 3Q21 will be another missed opportunity to turn the tide in our view. We believe that 3Q21 orders will come in at €740m (-1% vs. consensus) while revenues will hit €830m (-1% vs. consensus). Thus, business activity is expected to barely change from 2Q21 levels as end clients continue to be reluctant to place new orders and muted passenger transport activity is expected to weigh on the aftermarket business. We expect EBITDA to come in at €181m, roughly in line with consensus estimates. Given that consensus estimates have come down significantly since the start of October and the share price is off roughly -12% from its high in September (vs. Stoxx 600 Industrials -2%), we believe that most of the bad news for 3Q21 is already priced in. Therefore, market participants will likely be eager to learn about 4Q21 order momentum in RVS and the likelinood that the market has finally reached the much- anticipated inflection point. In addition, we are looking forward to getting some more background information on the sudden departure of Dr. Laier, the current CEO of CVS.",Alexander Wahl,"Alexander Wahl, CFA;Marc Zeck, CFA",100,,Hold,,EUR,4.04,,4.57,,1.82,2.06,,,,,M,STIFEL_3Q21 preview-_FlashCoNote_Oct 25 2021 01-03AM.pdf,STIFEL_3Q21 preview-_FlashCoNote_Oct 25 2021 01-03AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=be9d98ba-7cf1-4029-88d5-b0c84508b84f&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

Sales increased by 19% y/y to €276m, 3% ahead of consensus. Adj. EBITDA was €72.8m, 8.9% ahead of consensus. The margin declined by 266bps due to further growth investments. Performance was strong across all segments driven by ongoing government initiatives for digitisation in the European healthcare sector.

SHA lowered the outlook for group revenue growth to >7% (from >11%) to reflect lower light vehicle production but maintained the group margin target (8-9.5%). The stock was down pre-market (but started to recover), which we largely attribute to the formal cut to headline revenue growth.

VOLVB SS,VOLVB,Oct 21 2021 02:13AM,Volvo,Automotive,3Q21 quick take: solid earnings beat but supply chain comments in focus ,"Volvo released solid 3Q21 results this morning, with revenues and unit salesbroadly in-line with expectations, but a c8.5% beat vs consensus industrial adj. EBIT, which underscores good production flexibility and prize realization in the quarter. While 3Q21 results were good, we think forward looking statements on the supply chain and market expectations are more important at this stage. VOLVO points towards continued disruptions in the supply chain and stoppages also in coming quarters, which is also underscored by a 2022 Trucks market outlook that probably suggests little volume upside at least in 1H22 vs. 2H21. ","Group results: Group industrial revenues came in at SEK 82.3bn (SFe: SEK 83.5bn, cons 81.8bn) and group industrial adj. EBIT at 8.6bn (10.4% margin), marginally ahead of our forecast (SEK 8.5bn) but c8.4% ahead of consensus (SEK 7.9bn). A results table is shown in page 2 of this note. Trucks EBIT a good beat vs. consensus: Truck unit sales of 43,984 (+16.6% y/ y) in-line with expectations and Trucks adj. EBIT at SEK 5.8bn (10.9% margin), 5% ahead of Stifel and c9% ahead of consensus on good prize realization and despite stop-and-go production due to tight chip supply. Truck orders came in at only 51,118 units (-11% y/y), which we think is rather a reflection of selective order acceptance due to production constraints and long delivery times than of weakening end market demand. Construction Equipment (CE): CE revenues came in 0.7% ahead of consensus and adj. EBIT 6.7% ahead of consensus at a margin of 13.4% (SFe: 13.3%, cons 12.7%) on good product and regional mix and we think price realization. Market outlook: Volvo also updated its market outlook for 2021 and released a first view on 2022 volumes. For Trucks, the company now sees 30k fewer units in Europa and North America in 2021 and c300k truck units in both Europe and North America in 2022. The latter implies growth of c9% and 11%, respectively. For CE, we think regional forecasts are broadly in-line with expectations though the outlook for China at -25% to -15% in 2022E could bear some downward revisions potential (Visible Alpha consensus assumes virtually stable volumes y/y for CE and a mere c4% delivery drop in Asia).

WLN FP,WLN,Oct 26 2021 03:25PM,Worldline,Payment Services,3Q21 Quick Take: Mixed at best ,"The Terminals, Solutions & Services (TSS) segment is now deconsolidated andtreated as discontinued operations. Management opined that it is looking to sell the TSS segment within the next 12-18 months. 3Q21 revenues were 2-3% below expectations driven by a slower-than-expected acceleration in Merchant Services (+9.2% y/y). New FY21 guidance (adjusted for the deconsolidation of TSS) is broadly equivalent to the previous pro forma guidance on our calculations, as confirmed by the CFO during the call. ","New 3-year plan to be presented at investor day tomorrow. (+/=) Worldline management has reiterated the divestment strategy of the Terminals, Solutions & Services (TSS) segment which is now deconsolidated and treated as discontinued operations. Management is ""giving priority to the short-term scenario with sale discussions progressing"" and expects to divest TSS within the next 12 (utmost 18) months. While the deconsolidation is a clear sign of the intent to divest TSS, we believe investors might be concerned about the impact on Worldline's negotiation power from a quick sale, the uncertainty of the structure of the potential sale and on the impact on employee morale/attrition should the process take too long. (-) Revenues 2—3% below expectations. Excl. TSS, 3Q21 group revs increased by 8.3% y/y organically (cons: +8.5% y/y including TSS) to €960m, vs. our €979m (cons: €1,316m incl. TSS, SFe: €1,306m incl. TSS). This compares to organic rev growth of +10.1% / -2.7% y/y in 2Q21 / 3Q20. (-) Merchant Services revenues were up 9.2% in 3Q21 (2Q21 /3Q20: +18.6% /-4.7% y/y), below our expectations, with a positive ongoing dynamic in domestic payment volumes despite a tougher comparison basis. (-) Financial Services revenues were up 5.0% in 3Q21 (2Q21 / 3Q20: +3.9% / -0.4% y/y), below our expectations. Notably, the comparison basis was tougher in the acquiring processing business. (+) Mobility & e-Transactional Services revenues were up 10.9% in 3Q21 (2Q21 / 3Q20: +9.4% / -2.0% y/y), above our expectations, thanks to the recovery on transactional revenue coupled with the roll-out of several projects. e@ On October 27, Worldline will present at an investor day its new 3-year plan, which we expect to exclude the TSS business. e@ (=) FY21 guidance now excluding TSS and broadly equivalent to previous pro- forma guidance. Management now targets: 1. FY21 organic revenue growth of at least 6% (previously at least mid single digits and cons: +5.5%), which we estimate is in line with previous guidance when adjusted for TSS. Management expects revenue growth to accelerate further in 4Q21, with growth similar to that seen in 2Q21 (+14% y/y). Furthermore, management noted that TSS should also grow in DD in 4Q and clarified that it would have retained FY21 guidance even if TSS had not been deconsolidated. 2.

NEM GY,NEM,Oct 29 2021 06:00AM,Nemetschek SE,Software,3Q21 results: Bluebeam transition looms ,"Licence rev growth sequentially decelerated to +7.1% y/y in 3Q (+30.0% / -2.9%in 2Q21 / 3Q20), largely on the back of relatively tougher comps and a slowdown in Design segment (+7.5%) in the key DACH region. However, organic revenue growth remained robust in Build (+16.6% y/y and Multimedia (+37.1%). e@ While we continue to forecast Nemetschek to deliver solid 4Q21 results, looking ahead, we expect the focus to increasingly return to the Bluebeam transition and the consequent uncertainty in the pace and success of the business model transition. We believe Nemetschek should achieve peak top-line growth and EBITDA margins in 2021E and we forecast sales growth to slow to 9% organically (2021E: 15%) and the EBITDA margin to drop to 29.7% in 2022E (2021E: 32.2%). e Nemetschek now trades at a 12-month forward PE of 74x, a 64% premium to its global peers, up from the 46% premium seen in the last two years. Given this valuation premium and the upcoming Bluebeam transition, we see limited upside potential for Nemetschek shares in the near term. We reiterate our Hold rating and €95 price target. ","Bluebeam transition overhang keeps us Neutral Nemetschek's share outperformance in the last eight months has been driven by top- line recovery post the Covid-19 crisis and the extraordinary improvement in EBITDA margins (up 300 bps YTD). However, going forward, we expect focus to return to the transition of Bluebeam to subscriptions. We argue the significant uncertainty in the pace of this business model transition and the accompanying headwind to top-line growth, and EBITDA margin expansion, should limit any sustained outperformance of NEM stock. We believe Nemetschek should reach a peak in 2021E in terms of revenue growth and margins. We forecast revenue growth to slow to 9% organically in 2022E, from 15% in 2021E, and EBITDA margin to drop to 29.7% in 2022E, vs. 32.2% in 2021E, resulting in flattish EPS in 2022E. FY21 guidance tweaked to the upper end of the range, still below consensus Nemetschek tweaked its FY21 guidance to the upper end of its guidance range of — (1) 12-14% growth in group FY21 revenue in CC, vs. consensus at €14.1%, (2) FY21 EBITDA margin of 30-32%, vs. consensus of 32.2%. However, during the 3Q21 analyst call, management opined that FY21 revenue growth should be at least 14% in CC. In addition, the company plans to invest into the business and push towards subscription in FY22, suggesting that profitability should likely peak in FY21. Valuation and Catalyst Nemetschek is due to report its preliminary FY21 results in early February 2022.

Since April 2021, Nemetschek shares have dramatically re-rated from 57x to 74x P/E now. While we expect Nemetschek to provide solid results in 4Q21, we see limited upside potential from the current share price.

Greater China, down -15% (SFe -13%), continued to suffer from the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) issue resulting in Western brands' bashing from Chinese consumers end-March. We discussed this topic in our Stifel Athletic brands in China call #3, highlighting a more significant impact for both NKE and ADS than for PUM (see 2- year stack CER growth, chart 1, page 2). Gross margin of 50.1% was below estimates down 20bp (excl. Reebok), below consensus and SFe respectively +20bp and +0bp, with lower promotional intensity offset by (1) the negative regional mix, China being the most profitable region and (2) higher freight rates and input costs, and southern Vietnam lockdowns (leading footwear sourcing country disrupted during the bulk of 3Q21). EBIT margin was down -150bp at 11.7%%. (vs. cons. and SFe -210bp). The 2Q21 increase in marketing spend (+17% YOY) has continued in 3Q21 +25% (vs. SFe at +22%) while SG&A remained under control, up only 0.5% (SFe at +6%) allowing some operating leverage. Inventories were down 23% YOY at CER compared with 3Q20, in line with 2Q21 trend (-22%). We detail inventory levels as a percentage of Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) sales for major brands (see chart 2, page 2). FY21 guidance is reiterated except for GM%, as expected: Sales to grow ""up to 20%"" at CER (SFe +17%, cons. +18%). Gross margin: cut to 50.5%-51.0% (was ~52%). Our and consensus estimates were already factoring such levels (SFe 50.5%, cons. 51.0%). In FY20, GM% stood at 50.0%. Operating margin between 9.5% and 10% (SFe 9.6%, cons. 9.7%). Net earnings of €1.4-1.5bn (cons. & SFe €1.4bn). Conference call (webcast) at 3pm CET. We will focus more closely on the following topics: China. This region accounted for 25% of the group's sales in 2020 (excl. Reebok), we will be watching for any sign of improvement in this key market over the very last days. Vietnam. Most critical region for Adidas's sourcing, especially for footwear (42% footwear volumes in 2020).

HHFA GY,HHFA,Nov 10 2021 07:12AM,HHLA AG,Transportation,3Q21 results: one-offs drive results ,"Hamburger Hafen unexpectedly released 3Q21 results today as its distributionprovider released the 3Q21 press statement prematurely. Reported 3Q21 EBIT came in at €67.6m, significantly ahead of company compiled-consensus estimates (CCCe) of €60.7m (11% beat). That said, the EBIT beat is primarily driven by higher container dwelling fees in the Container division where 3Q21 EBIT came in at €44.5m vs CCCe of €36.3m while Intermodal results were in line with expectations at €33.5m. Importantly, volumes in Containers (1,796KTEU vs CCCe 1,891kTEU) and Intermodal (422kTEU vs CCCe 440kTEU) fell short of expectations. In addition, the reported EBIT figure includes €11m in COVID-related subsidies for FY20 paid out in 3Q21. We believe this one-off is included in consensus estimates as it was ","flagged by the company when it raised guidance on 20 October. The conference call is due to take place tomorrow at 2:30pm CET as scheduled originally. Strong EBIT beat driven by container dwelling fees, volumes disappoint Hamburger Hafen reported 3Q21 revenues of €362m vs CCCe of 368m (-2% miss) and EBIT of €67.6m, 11% ahead of CCCe of €60.7m. The Container division contributed significantly to the beat with revenues of €21.5m vs CCCe of €21.5m and EBIT of €44.5m vs CCCe of €36.3m (23% beat). The strong performance was mostly driven by higher container dwelling fees as overall volumes fell short of estimates at 1,796kKTEU vs CCCe 1,891kTEU. This translates to EBIT/Container of €25 vs CCCe at €19. On the other hand, Intermodal EBIT of €33.5m were in line with CCCe of €33.2m although revenues and volumes disappointed slightly (-4% miss) at €130m vs CCCe of €135.7m and 442kTEU vs CCCe of 440kTEU. This translates to EBIT/container of €79 vs CCCe of €75. In addition, Intermodal booked an €11m subsidy in 3Q21 related to track access charges paid in FY20. We believe the subsidy was reflected in consensus estimates as this was flagged when Hamburger Hafen raised FY21 guidance on 20 October. Overall, we believe the group EBIT result of €67.6m and the 11% beat are low quality figures as they depend mainly on one-off payments and high container dwelling fees that are not sustainable. In addition, the current FY21 EBIT guidance implies that EBIT will only be €38.7m in 4Q, which is significantly below the current quarterly run rate. We stick to our Hold rating and reiterate our price target of €19.50.

KBX GY,KBX,Nov 12 2021 02:47AM,KNORR-BREMSE AG,Automotive Supplier,"3Q21 Results: First Take - FY21 EBIT guidance cut, FY22 sneak preview lacklustre ",With this note we transfer primary coverage of Knorr-Bremse to Marc Zeck.,"KBX reported 3Q21 results largely in line with expectations at the group level but missed in RVS and beat in CVS. The company also cut the FY21 EBIT guidance to the lower corridor, likely reflecting low momentum in RVS. With respect to FY22, the company expects revenues to be slightly up to solid while the operating EBIT margin is expected to increase only slightly which might be disappointing to investors. FY22 is still likely to be affected by a slow recovery in rail and ongoing supply chain constraints and higher inflation. Group results largely in line with estimates ... 3Q21 Group revenues came in at €1,590m vs. company compiled consensus estimates (CCCe) €1,610m (-1.3% miss), SFe €1,580. 3Q21 adj. EBIT of €216m was slightly ahead of CCCe of €212m (2.1% beat), SFe €210m. Order intake hit €1,440m vs. CCCe €1,424m (1.1% beat). ... but on a divisional level RVS missed while CVS beat estimates: At the divisional level RVS revenue came in at €805m vs. CCCe €841m (4.2% miss), SFe €830m while adj. EBIT reached €142m vs. CCCe €153m (-7% miss), SFe €150m. Order intake was €739m vs. CCCe €745m. These figures were adjusted for a €3m restructuring charge in RVS US. According to the press statement, RVS continues to be affected by lower OE volume as well as slow momentum in the rail services business. CVS revenue came in at €785m vs. CCCe of €770m (+1.9% beat), SFe €750 while EBIT hit €85m vs. CCCe €74m (15% beat), SFe €77m. Order intake was €697m vs. CCCe €679m. According to the press statement, the rather okayish performance in CVS was driven by high underlying market demand in EU/NA despite ongoing supply chain issues which will likely shift some orders into 2022. FY21 EBIT guidance adjusted downwards, presumably due to still lower RVs momentum: KBX kept the FY21 revenue guidance’s midpoint at €6,700m (in line with CCCe) while narrowing the corridor to €6,600-6,800m from €6,500-6,900m but adjusted down the EBIT margin guidance to 13%-13.5% from 13%-14.5% translating into a new EBIT corridor of €858-918m (midpoint €888m vs. CCCe FY21 EBIT €938m). In addition, the company provided a brief preview on FY22, saying that it expects revenues to be slightly up or solid while the EBIT margin is expected to be up slightly as well. This compares to more aggressive consensus revenue growth expectations of 7% from the FY21 guidance's midpoint and an expected FY22 EBIT margin of 14.7%.

HLAG GY,HLAG,Nov 12 2021 03:59AM,Hapag-Lloyd,Transportation,3Q21 results: first take - in line with prelims ,"Hapag-Lloyd reported 3Q21 figures in line with preliminary results reported acouple of weeks ago. 3Q21 EBITDA came in at €3.3bn (prelim €3.3bn) while EBIT hit €2.9bn (prelim €2.9bn). Consensus estimates are somewhat below these figures, which in our view reflects stale estimates rather than a belief that Hapag-Lloyd wouldn’t deliver on the prelims. The average 3Q21 freight rate came in at $2,243/container and Hapag-Lloyd transported about 2,976kTEU. While consensus estimates for these KPIs are stale again, we would like to stress that the sluggish volume development (+1% YoY) is a function of port congestion and overall trouble in ocean transport rather than market share losses vs competitors. Finally, the company confirmed FY21 EBITDA guidance of €10.1-10.9bn. ","3Q21 results (unsurprisingly) driven by high freight rates: 3Q21 revenues grew by 108% YoY to €6.2bn while EBITDA hit €3.3bn, in line with preliminary results and up 417% YoY, which translates to an EBITDA margin of 52.9%. EBIT jumped by 760% YoY to €2.9bn, which translates to an EBIT margin of 46.5%. Freight average freight rates were up 106% to $2,234/TEU, which unsurprisingly is the major driver of the increase in profitability. Volume development on the other hand was sluggish as Hapag-Lloyd only transported about 2.97m containers in 3Q, up 1% YoY. The strong rise in freight rates overcompensated a significant increase in bunker prices, which rose to roughly $525/ton, up 74% YoY. FY21 EBITDA guidance confirmed implying at least stable EBITDA in 4Q21: Hapag-Lloyd confirmed the current FY21 EBITDA guidance range of €10.1-10.9bn, which at the lower end implies a 4Q21 EBITDA of €3.3bn which is level with the 3Q21 results while the upper range of the guidance implies a 4Q21 EBITDA of €4.1bn. In the quarterly report, Hapag-Lloyd as usual quoted an outlook from ocean intelligence provider Drewry, which at this point doesn't expect global supply chains to return to normal before the end of FY22. We are looking forward to the conference call at 11am CET to learn whether that reflects Hapag-Lloyd’s expectations as well.

Volume ex AGIL in Air was flat vs 2Q21 while volume in ocean was down -2%. The company reiterated its FY21 guidance and raised the expected AGIL EBIT contribution to DKK3bn from DKK2.8bn. The integration is expected to be completed by end of 3Q22. Finally, the company started a new share buy-back programme worth DKK5bn. We reiterate our Buy rating. ","strong set of numbers: DSV reported 3Q21 net revenue of DKK50bn (+76% YoY) 25% ahead of CCCe of DKK39.8bn. However, we wouldn't get too excited on the revenue number as gross profit is more important. Gross profit was DKK9,823m (+36% YoY) vs CCCe DKK9,726m and the gross margin came in at 19.8% vs. an expected gross margin of 24.4%. EBIT rose by 64% YoY to DKK4,472m vs. CCCe of DKK4,449m. DSV therefore increased the conversion ratio from 37.6% in 3Q20 to 45.5% vs. an expected conversion ratio of 45.7%. EBIT performance driven by the Air&Sea division: EBIT in Air&Sea rose by 77% YoY to DKK3,521m vs. CCCe of DKK3,580m. Volumes in Air rose by 28.8% YoY to 360ktons while volume in Sea rose by 12% to 633kTEU. Excluding AGIL, the volume development in Air was essential flat Q0Q while Ocean volume was down -2%. Gross profit per unit came in at DKK8.61 in Air vs. DKK8.59 a year ago. Gross profit per unit came in at DKK4.71 in Sea vs. DKK3.04 a year ago. Total gross profit rose to DKK6,314m (47% YoY) vs. CCCe of DKK6,319m which means the conversion ratio in Air&Sea improved to 55.8% from 46.3% a year ago vs an expected conversion ratio of 56.7%. Revenue in Road increased by 17% YoY to DKK8,783m vs CCCe of DKK8,685m. EBIT rose by 4% YoY to DKK465m ahead of CCCe of DKK444m. Revenues in Solutions increased by 40% YoY to DKK4,739m ahead of CCCe of DKK4,219m. EBIT came in at DKK486m vs CCCe DKK413m. AGIL better than expected: DSV raised the expected EBIT contribution from AGIL to DKK3bn from DKK2.8bn previously. DKK900m will be realised in FY21 while DKK1,650 will come through in FY22 and the final DKK450m will be realised in FY23. In terms of integration costs, DSV expects post-EBIT special items of -DKK500m in FY21 and - DKK‘1bn in FY22. Management changes: Current CFO Mr Jens Lund will become COO while current deputy group CFO Mr Michael Ebbe will become CFO. Mr Ebbe has been part of the group finance management team since 2007, so we don’t expect a significant change in DSV’s strategy. According to the press release, Mr Lund will have a more strategic role going forward. The conference call will take place at 11AM CEST and we expect to get some more information on current trading conditions and 2022 transport conditions as well as the rationale behind Mr Lund’s move to become COO.

At the divisional level, 3Q21 EBITDA in Ocean rose by 246% YoY to US$6.25bn vs. consensus of US $6.2bn.

FY21 EBITDA guidance was already raised with preliminary results to US$22-23bn from US$18-19.5bn before. 1Q22 EBITDA is expected to be in line with 4Q21 results, which at the midpoint of the current guidance imply US$6.5bn which is already 40% of FY22 CCCe EBITDA of US $16.9bn and SFe of US$17bn. The company also announced an extension of the current share buy-back programme worth US$5bn over 2024 and 2025. Finally, Maersk announced the acquisition of Senator International, a German freight forwarding company. ","strong set of numbers: Maersk reported 3Q21 revenue of US$16.6bn (+68% YoY), in line with CCCe of US$16.5bn. EBITDA was US$6.9bn (+202%) vs consensus of US$6.8bn. The EBITDA margin is 41.8% vs. an expected EBITDA margin of 41.4%. EBIT rose by +355% to US$5.9bn, and the EBIT margin came in at 35.3% vs. an expected EBIT margin of 35.1%. EBITDA performance driven by higher freight rates in the Ocean division: EBITDA in Ocean rose by +246% YoY to US$6.25bn vs. consensus of US$6.2bn. Freight rates rose by 87% to US $3,561 per container while volumes were flat at 3,263k containers. In our view, low transported freight volume comes naturally with congestion and delays which is why we are not worried about this figure. High freight rates and low volumes are different sides of the same coin. Revenue came in at US$13.1bn vs. consensus of US$13.1bn. The EBITDA margin came in at 47.7% vs. an expected EBITDA margin of 47%. Revenue in L&S increased by +38% YoY to US$2.6bn vs consensus of US$2.4bn. EBITDA rose by 104% YoY to US$267m vs. consensus estimates of US$244m. The EBITDA margin was 10.3% vs. an expected EBITDA margin of 10.2%. Revenue in T&T increased by 24% YoY to US$1.2bn vs consensus of US$1.1bn. EBITDA rose by 32% YoY to US$433bn vs. consensus estimates of US$422m. The EBITDA margin was 35.9% vs. an expected EBITDA margin of 37.4%. Free cash flow: FCF came in at US$5.3bn vs SFe US$4.8bn. Share buybacks: The company announced an extension of the current share buy-back programme worth US$5bn over 2024 and 2025. Outlook: Maersk confirmed the FY21 outlook and expects the current conditions in ocean freight to continue at least into 1Q22 and to bolster that claim issues a 1Q22 guidance that expects EBITDA to be in line with 4Q21. Based on the mid-point of the current FY21 EBITDA guidance, this translates to a 1Q22 EBITDA of US$6.5bn or 40% of CCCe FY22 EBITDA. M&A/Capex: Maersk announced the acquisition of Senator International, a German air freight forwarder for an estimated EV of US$644m. Senator International expects FY21 revenues of US $950m and EBITDA of US$80m which translates to an EV/EBITDA multiple of 8x. Maersk expects cumulative US$140m of EBITDA synergies by 2025 and the deal is expected to close in 1Q22. In contrast to traditional freight forwarders, Senator International owns a fleet of aircraft and its largest customer is reportedly BMW according to Deutsche Verkehrszeitung (DVZ) who reported on this deal last week already. While Senator International also owns a small ocean freight forwarding business, we believe that Senator International should be regarded as a carrier rather than a freight forwarder due to its fleet ownership. Thus, we believe this transaction is in line with the current strategy and strengthens Maersk’s Star Air business which also announced the acquisition of two additional B777F freighters. The company confirms its FY21-22 cumulative CAPEX guidance of US$7bn. The conference call will take place at 11am CET.

BOSS GY,BOSS,Nov 04 2021 03:52AM,Hugo Boss AG,Consumer Goods,3Q21 results - incremental bits and senior management shake-up ,"Hugo Boss pre-announced stronger-than-expected Q3 results and lifted FY21sales & EBIT guidance on 14/10, so the focus today is on incremental insights into the shape of its P&L and FCF performance as well as the organisational shake-up implemented in recent months. ","Two incremental salient points on financials: Q3 gross margin at 61.7% (-20bps y-o-y) was slightly lower than expected (VA consensus at c.62.4%) due to higher freight and duty costs more than offsetting lower markdown activity. This is consistent with the group’s medium-term gross margin target of 60-62%; Working capital performance was better than expected, with inventories down -6% y-o-y FX neutral. Coupled with higher payables, this more than compensated for higher receivables, leading to +10% y-o-y FCF growth in Q3. FY21 trade net working capital guidance was improved to 19-20% of sales (from 21-23% previously) while FY21 capex guidance was unchanged at €100-130m. Management shake-up. New CEO Daniel Grieder implemented several senior management changes in recent months aimed at strengthening the organisation to execute its CLAIM 5 strategy in coming years. These changes include: e@ Anew MD for Greater China (Judith Sun), Anew MD for a newly created ‘Emerging Markets & Russia’ hub (Luigi Boiocchi), Anew senior VP for BOSS Womenswear (KristinaSzasz), e@ Anew MD for Shoes & Leather Accessories, Bodywear & Hosiery, Knitwear and Shirts (CI ristopt er Korber), Anew senior VP for Global Marketing (Miah Sullivan).

","softer recovery than peers Sopra Steria continued to lag peers in 3Q21, despite an easier comparison basis than peers, and we expect this to continue in 2022. 3Q21 revenue were up organically by 13.2% at Capgemini (vs. -7.7% in 3Q20) but up only by 8.9% at Sopra Steria (vs. -8.4% in 3Q20). With -2% at Sopra Banking Software, Sopra Steria also continued to lag Temenos at +9% in 3Q21. For 2022, we forecast organic revenue growth of 10% at Capgemini vs. 6% at Sopra Steria (flat at Sopra Banking Software vs. 10% at Temenos). This reflects Sopra Steria' lower exposure to Digital drivers and muted mid-term growth prospects at Sopra Banking Software (migration to subscriptions, decline in services) and at Sopra Financial Technology (down 12% y/y in 3Q21). Despite an easier comparison basis thanks to the €43m impact from the 4Q20 cyberattack, we expect organic revenue growth to remain unchanged at +8.9% in 4Q21 (vs. management guidance of 8-9% and vs. +13.1% at Capgemini), due to the phasing out of strong visa renewals in the UK. We are slightly cautious on 2H21 margins We forecast an OPBA margin of 8.4% in 2H21 (vs. 8.0% / 7.2% in 2H20 / 1H21), slightly below consensus at 8.7%, as we expect margins to be impacted by greater hiring costs, product digitalisation investments in Other Solutions and softer growth in the UK. Our margin estimate of 7.8% for 2021 remains however within the guidance range of 7.7-8.0% (vs. consensus at 8.0%). We remain cautious on mid-term margins and on acquisition prices We believe management's mid-term guidance of a ~10% OPBA margin by 2023E is optimistic and is likely to be pushed back once again. In our view, consensus remains optimistic too on margins for which we are materially below, while consensus revenue estimates leave limited room for organic upside given the digital transformation tailwind is largely priced in. We are also cautious on the future M&A strategy. Average acquisition multiples paid by Sopra Steria since 2015 have been 1.4x EV/revenue, an ~80% premium to Sopra Steria’s average multiple of 0.8x, and without a visible uplift of the group’s top-line growth and margins. Valuation and catalysts We derive a €157/share price target from our DCF-based valuation. Sopra Steria is currently trading at 7.3x EV/12m forward EBITDA vs. its peers at 13.7x.

REY IM,REY,Nov 18 2021 01:00AM,Reply,IT Services,3Q21 review: margin strength to stay ,"We expect margins to remain strong in 4Q21 and in 2022, as in 3Q21, notablythanks to low travel costs, especially in light of the surge of Covid cases in Germany. Going forward, we believe Reply can offset a partial return of these costs with international footprint reaching critical mass. e Reply's revenue growth continued to outperform most peers in 3Q21, despite a tougher comparison basis than peers.

","Margins should continue to benefit from low travel costs Our 2021-23E adj. EBITDA estimates are ~5% above consensus, mostly thanks to our higher margin forecasts of 17.5% on average vs. consensus at 17.0%. Over the last 12 months, adj. EBITDA margin stood at 17.7% (vs. 16.2% in 2019 and vs. 2021E consensus at 17.1%), with travel costs representing 1.4% of revenue (vs. 3.4% in 2019). We expect travel costs to remain low in 4Q21 and in most of 2022, especially in light of the surge of Covid cases in Germany. While we do expect some travel costs to partly come back over 2022-23E, we also expect profitability to benefit from international footprints (Region 3 and the U.S. in Region 1) reaching critical mass. As an example, a lift of Region (16% of group revenue, mostly the U.K.) margins from 12.7% in the last 12 months to the 18.2% margin of the rest of the group would increase group margins by 90bps. Strong organic growth is here to stay, along with a M&A boost Reply's revenue growth continued to outperform most peers in 3Q21, despite a tougher comparison basis than peers.

We continue to believe that Reply's profile of consistently strong growth and positive earnings revisions is here to stay, protecting its premium valuation. The unique network structure gives Reply the agility to be an early adopter of technology by continuously focusing on high-growth activities. Reply’s sales have grown by a 10% organic CAGR over the past 14 years, and we expect double-digit growth to continue in the coming years. We believe consensus fails to reflect Reply's external sales growth potential, which is part of its business model of being an early adopter by acquiring niche companies with leading skills in new technologies.

VOLVB SS,VOLVB,Oct 25 2021 01:15AM,Volvo,Automotive,3Q21 review: good quarter but supply chain remains key ,"Volvo released overall good 3Q21 results against a backdrop of a strainedsupply chain and input cost inflation with industrial group adj.

In this regard, we expect little support through 1H22 and remain on Hold. ","3Q21 review — good margins despite difficult supply chain Volvo released good 3Q21 results with industrial group adj. EBIT c.8.5% ahead of consensus and a margin of 10.4%. Truck margin was up sequentially (10.9% vs. 10.3% in 2Q21) despite lower volumes as good cost control and strong price realisation made up for sequentially lower volumes, which suffered from production stoppages due to tight chip supply. Truck orders came in weaker, down c.11% y/y and c12% q/q, largely reflecting that Volvo is only selectively accepting new orders due to constrained production and already long delivery times (in part stretching into 2H22) but underlying truck demand remains strong. Good quarterly results but market outlook currently leaves little room for upside Overall, it was a solid quarter, but of minor relevance at this stage as investors focus on supply chain comments and implications for the 4Q21 and 2022 volume trajectory. In this regard, we think Volvo's truck market expectation for 2022 with an implied volume growth of 7% for Europe and 11% for North America was just good enough to back current consensus expectations. During the call, management moreover highlighted that atleast during 1H22, components availability will continue to determine production rates, and we think the 1H22 delivery run rate is unlikely to exceed that of 2H21 materially. Similarly, we believe Volvo's expectation of a 15-25% y/y decline in Chinese construction equipment demand in 2022 leaves little room for volume upgrades at this stage. While volumes remain constrained, pricing is good and, in our view, the key positive takeaway from the results and the conference call is Volvo's ability to fully pass on raw material price inflation to customers (pricing is even ahead of raw materials in trucks according to the company). Higher ASP assumptions are the key driver of our slightly higher revenue and earnings forecasts. Positive supply chain update needed for shares to regain momentum With pricing already as good as it can get and demonstrated cost flexibility in the quarter, we think meaningful earnings upside can only come from higher volumes, i.e., it largely boils down to this question: when will supply chain headwinds ease and truck deliveries align with underlying demand rather than with components availability? For the time being, we expect little support on that front at least through 1H22. Our price target rises slightly to SEK213 (from SEK210) on higher estimates, largely driven by higher ASP assumptions, and implies that Volvo will trade on 10x industrial EV/adj. EBIT 2022E.

OR FP,OR,Oct 22 2021 12:00AM,L'Oreal,Personal & Household Goods,3Q21 sales: call feedback and model update - Tres belle performance ,"L’Oréal delivered a material 3Q21 sales beat (+13% LFL growth vs. +8%consensus), which represents an impressive two-year stack LFL growth acceleration to +15% in Q3 from +8% in Q2 and +5% in Q1. Growth was well- balanced, with all product divisions comfortably beating consensus. From a regional standpoint, North America was clearly a bright spot in Q3, complemented by a substantial sequential two-year stack acceleration in Europe and Latin America, all of which more than offset a sequential two-year slowdown in Asia. Significant market share gains in a recovering global beauty market and a balanced regional mix helped L’Oréal to navigate very well through a quarter in which COVID- led disruption temporarily impacted its brick-and-mortar business in China and in other key Asian markets over the summer. The Q4 set-up for Asia looks well-oriented, with the reopening of stores on the back of COVID restrictions being lifted in China and encouraging traffic to Hainan during the Golden Week with the resumption of domestic travel. In addition, LOréal's accelerating momentum in the US, its second key regional growth engine, should be particularly well-received tomorrow. Forecast changes. We increased our FY21-23E EBIT forecasts by 2% and lifted our PT accordingly to €430. We factor +7% organic growth in 4Q21 (+12% two-year) and 19.5% adjusted EBIT margin in FY21E while we continue to model +7% organic growth in 2022-25E and 21% adjusted EBT margin by 2025E. ","Key numbers: Q3 sales were BETTER than expected (+13% LFL vs. +8% Bloomberg consensus) driven by better than expected growth for all divisions: +28% vs. +16% consensus for Active Cosmetics, +21% vs. +17% consensus for Luxe, +10% vs. +3% consensus for Professional Products and +3% vs. 0% consensus for Consumer Products. This represents a substantial two-year LFL stack acceleration for all divisions: from +55% in Q2 to +67% in Q3 for Active Cosmetics, from +13% in Q2 to +22% in Q3 for Professional Products, from +10% to +13% for Luxe (despite a slowdown in China) and from -3% to +4% for the Consumer Division. From a regional perspective, two-year LFL growth accelerated substantially in North America (+24% in Q3 vs. +8% in Q2), Latin America (+26% in Q3 vs. +13% in Q2) and Europe (+7% in Q3 vs. -4% in Q2) and decelerated in North Asia (+18% in Q3 vs. +31% in Q2). Buy thesis reinforced post Q3 sales: L'Oréal's premium valuation is well-supported by superior top-line momentum and unmatched business fundamentals in the European HPC space. Skincare, China, US, luxury, dermocosmetics and e-commerce remain secular, powerful growth engines for L'Oréal, while travel retail offers recovery optionality from 2022 onwards. Structurally faster-growing businesses like Active Cosmetics and Luxe should jointly account for 50% of group sales in 2021E (vs. 33% of total sales in 2011E), which underpins our 7% organic sales forecasts for the group in the medium- term. Price-mix momentum, operating leverage and P&L productivity initiatives (B2B digitalisation, A&P optimisation and more productive distribution) should help L’Oréal to manage escalating input cost inflation pressure on margins better than its European HPC peers and improve its operating margin to 20%+ by 2023E.

FR FP,FR,Oct 29 2021 06:00AM,Valeo,Automotive Supplier,3Q21 Sales: In line; the devil is in the detail ,"Factoring in lower revenue and loss-making VSeA full consolidation starting 2Q-22 (vs2023 previously), we have cut our EPS sequence by an average of 16% through 2023 and trimmed our target price from €29 to €27. e@ Group printed 3Q21 revenues of c.€4bn, which were in line (+1%) with company-polled consensus (better aftermarket mitigating weaker OE sales). e Regarding FY21 guidance, the adjustments might puzzle investors: the good news is that the EBITDA margin range has been narrowed upward despite a lower revenue band (in our view, the latter was expected). Valeo, however dropped VSeA profitability targets, where losses should be in line with last year's level (c. -€0.25bn). e@ We assume that mixed investor sentiment could prevail post the 3Q21 print and maintain our Hold rating. ","3Q21 sales were in line, but of lower quality Group printed 3Q21 revenue down -10%, to €3.96bn, with OE sales slumping by 16% (SFe -12%); the latter was offset by solid performance in aftermarket sales (+16%) and tooling (+37%). The OE business outperformance in the quarter vs car production stood at +370bps. This is lower than both Plastic Omnium (+510 bps, POM FP, €23.38, Hold) and Faurecia (+780bps, EO FP, €43.50, Buy) recorded. By key region, Valeo has suffered from declines in EMEA (-22%; the region accounts for 42% of OE revenues) and Nafta (-22%; 20% of OE revenues). Guidance adjustments might unsettle investors Guidance revisions were a mixed bag. On the positive side, we appreciate that narrowing the EBITDA margin guidance upwards to 13%-13.4% for the full year (vs 12.8%-13.4% previously) looks reassuring given mid-range revenue expectations have been cut by €0.8bn, to €16.8bn-€17.2bn (vs €17.6bn-18.2bn previously). However, on the back of low visibility, management did not clearly state that it was aiming for the top end (which was the case previously). However, the unexpected bad news came from the JV, where losses should remain flat on the previous year (c.-€0.25bn) and no longer narrow despite a sizeable increase in revenue (+45% to €0.75bn in 2021; we modleled €900m ahead of the print). Not yet at tipping point The guidance revision (fewer revenues, ""stable plus"" EBITDA margin, higher VsEA losses) should lead to consensus Ebitda revisions of c.5-7% for FY21 (low EPS base being much more volatile), which is not extreme in the current uncertain production environment. However, sentiment should remain mixed given, (1) new guidance implies a larger top line decline in 4Q (-16%) vs 3Q (-10%) which clearly contradicts with the first signs of improvement on the semiconductor front, and (2) management declined to comment on the VSeA profitability timeline (breakeven could be postponed by at least 12m to 18m) and adjustments might unsettle investors. Hold reiterated We have cut our three-year EPS sequence by an average -16% from a low base, especially in 2021/2022. We have also fully accounted for VSeA starting 2Q-22 (vs 2023 previously) which should weigh on overall group margins as it is likely less profitable. Our moderately lowered price target seems to conflict with our significant EPS cuts, but is attributable to (1) lower debt/better FCF trend, and (2) rolling over valuation multiples to a more normal 2023 fiscal year.

BEI GY,BEI,Oct 29 2021 12:01PM,Beiersdorf,Personal & Household Goods,"3Q21 sales: model update & call feedback - Show-me story, but sell-off looks overdone ","Sell-off looks overdone. La Prairie's weaker than expected Q3 and a cautious 4 salesguidance do not help our Buy rating on the stock. But we think that the stock's sharp sell-off since mid-September (c.-15%) looks overdone considering: (1) the temporary nature of some issues holding back La Prairie in Q3 (Hainan and COVID restrictions in Asia), (2) a reassuring initial margin guidance for 2022 (calling for modest expansion while protecting its higher reinvestment commitments), (3) relatively small earnings cuts post yesterday's Q3 release. In addition, there were some clear positives in Q3: (1) broad-based market share gains for Eucerin in a buoyant dermocosmetics market, (2) a decent Q3 for NIVEA (+2.6% LFL was not too dissimilar from L'Oreal's CPD at +4%) with encouraging market share gains in face care across 2/3 of the markets in which it competes, (3) strong e-commerce growth (10% of global sales despite the fact that NIVEA under-indexes in China), and (4) tesa margin upgrade for FY21. At current price levels, we see the stock's risk-reward trade-off as favourable. We stick to our buy case for the following reasons: (1) attractive long-term fundamentals for Eucerin in derma and for La Prairie in luxury; (2) Scope for execution improvement at NIVEA under a new leadership team and backed by higher reinvestment; (3) Reasonable consensus expectations (not returning to historical peak margins in the next five years). What's changed? Changes to our FY21E EBIT estimates were immaterial, but we trimmed our FY22-23E EBIT forecasts by -2% and lowered our PT accordingly to €114 (from €117). For Consumer, we forecast +9% organic sales growth for FY21 (top end of the company's new guidance range) and +6% organic growth and +30bps margin expansion for FY22 (in line with its initial guidance). ","La Prairie (LP): the weak spot in Q3. La Prairie slowed from +41% LFL in H1 to +2% in Q3, with the two-year stack rate moving from -18% in H1 to -15% in Q3. As expected, Q3 was hit by temporary disruption in Hainan (trends improved in September), avoidance of promotions to protect brand equity (unlike competitors promoting online), very strong 3Q20 comparatives in China and the absence of Chinese international tourists in travel retail. We understand that LP slowed in Q3 to single-digit growth in China (+30 %YTD), flattish in Americas (against tougher comparatives) and saw no improvement in Europe, unlike what we heard from the likes of LVMH for Sephora Europe or L'Oreal. Our conclusion is that LP lost market share in the quarter (less promotional stance), but mobility trends in China improved sequentially in September/October, LP's brand equity remains strong and travel retail offers interesting recovery optionality in 2022. 2022 qualitative outlook. In Consumer, Beiersdorf aims to outperform market growth (3-4% in mass, higher than that for derma/luxury) driven by innovation in skincare and recovery in travel retail and sun care. We understand that this is consistent with +5-6% consensus LFL growth for 2022. For tesa, electronics should be the main growth driver and the automotive business is expected to re-accelerate in 2022. EBIT margin is expected to slightly improve versus 2021 thanks to pricing, mix and efficiencies offsetting input cost inflation, which should soften only in 2H22. The slight margin improvement guidance factors the committed reinvestment (behind innovation, digital, and sustainability), hence not impacting the quality of earnings. Valuation. Beiersdorf shares de-rated to c.27x 2022E P/E, broadly in-line with its past 10-year average, more than one-standard deviation below its relative P/E to L'Oreal and below its past 10-year average premium to MSCI Europe.",Rogerio Fujimori,Rogerio Fujimori,114,117,Buy,,EUR,3.07,,3.33,,0.7,0.7,,,,,M,STIFEL_3Q21 sales-_CoNote_Oct 29 2021 12-01PM.pdf,STIFEL_3Q21 sales-_CoNote_Oct 29 2021 12-01PM,EARNINGS UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=bb1c294c-3df4-494d-b688-8b360c4bea64&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
ML FP,ML,Oct 26 2021 01:00AM,Michelin,Automotive Supplier,3Q21 Sales: 3.7% beat; guidance maintained ,"Michelin printed revenues of €6bn in 3Q21, beating consensus by 3.7% driven bypricing. ","Despite scaling back market expectations (mainly SR1, SR3), management reiterated FY21 guidance to deliver an absolute operating margin of at least €2.8bn (consensus at €2.87bn) and a FCF of at least €1bn (consensus at €1.3bn). Initial reaction should be positive (price-mix +7% should bring some comfort to a timid consensus) though consensus earnings increases might be limited as the group reiterated guidance in a context of broad-based inflation (raw materials, energy, logistics and labour). Revenues up +8.6% in 3Q21. Michelin's revenues rose +8.6%, mostly on price-mix (+7%, o/w +5.2% in price) and reduced FX headwinds (-0.6%) as volumes are fading (+1.3%). Michelin is reaping the benefits of three rounds of price hikes in 2021 (1 March; 1 June, and all through September) which have probably been underestimated by consensus (+3.9% in the quarter). Group has scaled back industry outlooks: SR1 (aka light-vehicles) tire markets are now seen up +6-8% for the FY21 (vs +8-10% previously; exclusively on the OE side), SR2 (ex-China) are seen rising +11-13% (vs +9-11%) and SR3 could grow +9-11% (vs +10-12%). We estimate the compound impact at c. -3/4 of a point for Michelin vs previous assumptions. Guidance maintained. Group still aims to deliver an absolute operating margin (ex- items) of at least €2.8bn, which is where consensus currently stands, as robust pricing (melting FX headwind) should compensate for less accommodating volumes. Same applies to FCF guidance (of at least €1bn) as more unfavorable WCR (cost inflation) should be offset by lower capex. Conclusion: Solid 3Q21 revenues and reiterated guidance should please a consensus where expectations, in our understanding, have been carefully moderated. For the FY estimates, debate should remain whether Michelin is being excessively conservative. We think upward pressure to 2021 earnings are limited (inflation bites). Into, 2022 new rounds of price increase might be necessary, but that could come at the expense of volumes as non-indexed customers might be deterred.

RMS FP,RMS,Oct 21 2021 02:44AM,Hermes,Consumer Goods,3Q21 sales - impressive ,"Hermés Q3 sales performance was comfortably BETTER than expected (+31%at constant rates vs. +24% Visible Alpha consensus), implying a sequential acceleration to +40% two-year stacked growth in Q3 (from +33% in Q2). This was driven by an upturn in sales in Europe, sequential acceleration in Americas, sustained strong momentum in Asia (in particular China) and significant deliveries of leather goods during the quarter. ","Top line strength across the board, but the main positive surprises vs. consensus were France (47% vs. +26% consensus) and Rest of Europe (36% vs. +21% consensus), thanks to strong local customer demand, e-commerce growth and the partial return of tourist traffic. Growth in Asia ex-Japan (+29% vs. +23% consensus, with sustained dynamism in Greater China and shrugging off COVID restrictions in the region during the quarter) and Americas (+48% vs. +46% consensus) came also ahead of consensus while Japan came in-line (4% vs. +5% consensus, supported by strong loyalty of its Japanese clientele). By category, the main positive surprises were Leather Goods (+22% vs. +14% consensus, boosted by significant deliveries and sustained high demand), Silk & Textiles (+49% vs. +34% consensus), Other Hermes Sectors (+47.5% vs. +29% consensus, driven again by homeware and jewellery) and Watches (+54% vs. +46% consensus, significantly outperforming the industry).

EO FP,EO,Oct 26 2021 02:30AM,Faurecia,Automotive Supplier,"3Q21 Sales First Take: Slight miss, late September guidance maintained ",3Q21 sales revenue came in at €3.4bn down -10.4% or a -1.8% miss vs,"consensus expectations. Organic growth stood at -11.4% (+780bps vs car production seen at -19.2%). Unfavourable geographical mix. According to Faurecia's calculations, the regional mix had a negative impact of 450bps as the group's core regions took the bulk of the hit: European (39% of sales) and Nafta (26%) revenue declined by -20%/-17% respectively. By business group, Clarion (6% of group sales) posted the best performance (+7% like-for-like). On the other hand, Seating (38% of group sales) has declined organically by 14.3% despite key new start of production which contributed +€57m and should contribute around +140m in 4Q21. The group, however, mentioned that operational challenges in one Nafta greenfield plant should weigh on Seating's 2H21 profitability but is expected to be fixed by year-end. e@ 21 September reset guidance confirmed: The group still expects to deliver sales of c.€15.5bn (with outperformance vs. light vehicle production exceeding 600bps), an operating margin of 6.0-6.2% of sales and net cashflow of c.€0.5bn. Last, Hella acquisition process is on track: The takeover process launched on 27 September should complete on 11 November. Faurecia and Hella launched project “One” to be ""ready at closing"". Call starts at 8am CEST. Conclusion: The slight miss could weigh on the shares at the opening and investors should look for evidence that production is improving in 4Q21 (to support organic growth/targeted outperformance for the full year) during the call.

Late September reset guidance was confirmed assuming no further deterioration in the current operating environment with world car production between 71m to 73m units (or -1%/+1.8% range): (1) Growth in revenues vs 2020 company-polled consensus stands at +4.1%, (2) an operating margin of 4%-5% (consensus at 5%) and (3) FCF of at least €220m (consensus at €258m). Outperformance of 380 bps. Despite a sharp decline in the quarter, POM outperformed by 3.8 points, with world car production down 19.5% in the quarter. By region, the group (like Faurecia, EO FP, €42.97, Buy) was especially hit by its exposure to Europe (-18% vs car production down -30%) and Nafta (-18% as well vs car production down -25.5%). By business group, PO Modules (-23.9%) dropped significantly more than PO Industries (-10.7%). Call starts at 8am CEST. Next Milestone: 8 December, presentation of the group’s Sustainability Roadmap. Conclusion: The miss could weigh on the shares at the opening particularly as organic outperformance (+3.8 points) was lower compared with Faurecia (+7.8 points) in the quarter.

MONC IM,MONC,Oct 28 2021 03:23PM,Moncler,Consumer Goods,3Q21 sales — Q4 set-up looks well oriented ,"Moncler reported a reassuringly better than expected DTC performance in Q3across all regions, boosted by a significant contribution from additional retail space, most notably in Asia. The Q4 set-up looks well-oriented thanks to accelerating DTC momentum (with further growth acceleration in October) and strong brand heat (reinforced by its recent Mondo Genius event) - this should be enough to justify the stock’s current premium valuation and Moncler remains a core sector holding, in our view. ","Moncler reported better than expected DTC performance in Q3 (+40% y-o-y vs. +30% Visible Alpha consensus and our +35% forecast), implying a sequential two-year stack acceleration to +15% vs. 3Q19 from -2% vs. 2Q219. Retail space contribution was significant in Q3, with retail LFL still remaining slightly below 3Q19 levels. Wholesale slowed sequentially to +10% vs. 2019 entirely due to a different timing of deliveries and conversions to retail. From a regional perspective, Moncler saw sequential sales momentum improvement in Asia Pacific and EMEA and sequential DTC improvement in Americas. In Asia (+24% vs. 3Q19 from +9% vs. 2Q19), strong brand heat/desirability in China and eight store openings more than offset a soft quarter in Japan and COVID-related restrictions in the region. In EMEA (-2% vs. 3Q19 from -11% vs. 2Q19), sequential improvement was driven by local demand and online growth. In Americas (+10% vs. 3Q19 vs. +40% vs 2Q19), growth decelerated due to timing of shipments in wholesale that penalised Q3 at the expense of Q2, but DTC in the region also accelerated sequentially and sell-out trends in wholesale remain good. Management saw further sequential growth acceleration in October, supported by the recent lifting of lockdowns in markets like Japan. Stone Island remains on track to contribute with €200m revenues in FY21 after a solid Q3 performance. Management confirmed that FY21 consensus sales and EBIT margin expectations (between 28% and 29% in the full year) look reasonable. Premium valuation looks well-supported. Moncler shares had a good run into today’s results anticipating a sequential DTC acceleration in Q3 and on the back of the buzz around its recent Mondo Genius event. We like the group's long-term growth (driven by China, e-commerce and Stone Island's development potential), its attractive margin profile (we forecast 28.5% EBIT margin in 2021E) and its strong management (which has been strengthened with the arrival of Gino Fisanotti), however all these positives seem reflected into its premium valuation (43x 2021E P/E), in our view.

EQS GY,EQS,Nov 16 2021 12:13PM,EQS Group AG,Software,3Q21 update: Regulatory tailwinds to accelerate in 2022 and beyond ,"EQS reported solid 3Q21 numbers. Sales were up 40% y/y (in line withexpectations) and EBITDA came in at €0.9m, for €2.3m after 9 months, which is already in the guided FY21 range of €2-3m. e Q3 was characterised by strong growth of compliance cloud products and sales contributions from recent M&A (Business Keeper, Got Ethics, C2S2). We expect further acceleration in growth momentum going into 2022 as only two EU member states have so far implemented the EU Whistleblower Directive into national law. e We trim our 2021 sales estimates and increase the mid-term expectations due to delays in the implementation of the EU Directive. EPS comes down due to higher D&A expenses after recent acquisitions. e We confirm our Buy rating and increase our price target to €51 from €48. The structural growth drivers are fully intact and the regulatory tailwind should drive growth in 2022 and beyond, in our view. ","3Q21 numbers confirm the growth path... Group sales were up 40% y/y to €12.9m thanks to strong cloud compliance product sales, high demand from the new ESEF regulation, and sales contributions from M&A. The Compliance segment saw a 68% increase of sales to €8m, while Investor Relations sales were up 10% y/y to €4.8m. EBITDA was down to €0.9m from €1.3m last year due to the planned increase of sales and marketing expenses in anticipation of the EU Whistleblower (WB) Directive. However, as many EU member states are postponing the national legislation on the mandatory introduction of a WB solution, EQS has seen growth investments below plan year-to-date. The impact of this development is mainly noted in the SME area so that the number of new customers is behind with planning while revenues and new annual recurring revenues (ARR) are in line. We view this as a temporary phenomenon and expect a partial shift of sales by some months into 2022. ... that will gain traction into 2022 and beyond The implementation of the EU WB Directive has been slow in EU member states. Denmark and Sweden are the only countries that have implemented the Directive so far. Another six countries have made substantive progress and EQS management expects Germany to implement the law in 1H22. 17k companies out of a total of 50k in the EU reside in the Germany, making it the most important market for EQS. The partner channel should get more active as countries pass the law, thereby driving new customer acquisition. The partnership with the Bundesanzeiger (official publication of Germany) has started last week and should enable strong domestic growth in the next months (portal can be found here). Valuation and catalysts We value EQS using a blend of DCF and peer group valuation methods. Our DCF analysis (75% weight) yields a value of €50.00 per share, while the multiple-based analysis implies a value of €53.00 per share. Potential catalysts include accelerated growth in FY22 as the Business Keeper acquisition should significantly improve EQS's market position and could also lead to higher profitability due to short-term synergies and the consolidation of complementary resources, in our view. The main risks revolve around execution of the growth strategy and potential regulatory delays that could hamper near-term growth.",Yannik Siering,Yannik Siering,51,48,Buy,,EUR,-0.58,,-0.17,,0,0,,,,,M,STIFEL_3Q21 update-_CoNote_Nov 16 2021 12-13PM.pdf,STIFEL_3Q21 update-_CoNote_Nov 16 2021 12-13PM,EARNINGS UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=4115ab78-fd19-45b5-9012-f5899da08a5a&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
8TRA GY,8TRA,Oct 28 2021 03:48AM,Traton SE,Automotive,3Q21: Guidance lowered largely on Navistar ,"Traton released final 3Q21 results this morning, which, on an underlying basisexcl. Navistar, are ahead of our revenue and earnings expectations but below if Navistar is included. There is no company-collected consensus available this quarter. Traton has lowered its margin and net industrial cash flow outlook for FY21. Looking at the details, however, we find that the consolidation of Navistar largely explains the changes, and we think underlying performance ex. Navistar would still be within the previous target range. ","Group results: 3Q21 industrial group revenues came in at €7.9bn (+44% y/y), largely driven by Navistar (consolidated since July 1) contributing c€1.68bn and VWCO. Industrial group adj. EBIT at €129m (1.6% margin) incl. Navistar while margin would have been at 3.7% for Traton classic ex. Navistar. Brand performance: Scania revenues are up 9.6% y/y and adj. EBIT came in at €238m at a margin of 7.7%, sequentially down vs. c12% in 1H21 on input cost inflation and production inefficiencies related to semiconductor shortages. MAN brand revenues grew 4.9% in 3Q21 and EBIT margin came in at 2.5%, still ahead of our expectation while VWCO reported an exceptionally strong y/y revenue growth of 89% and 9.1% margin. Lowered guidance now includes Navistar, only slightly changed underlying: Traton has updated its outlook for FY21, which now also includes Navistar (see overview on p.3). The indication for a ""very sharp increase"" in industrial revenues is meaningless due to the acquisition of Navistar but Traton now sees industrial group adj. EBIT margin at 4.5-5.5% vs 4.5-6.5% before, i.e. has lowered the upper end. Compared to classic Traton, Navistar is margin dilutive (3Q21 industrial margin incl. Navistar of 1.6% vs. 3.7% ex. Navistar) potentially weighing on full-year group margin with c100bps, which largely explains the reduced guidance at the upper end, and we think the underlying outlook for classic Traton has only marginally changed. In terms of industrial net cash flow, Traton now sees €0-300m vs. €500-700m before. Navistar contributed a negative cash flow of c€-286m in 3Q21, and we understand this could improve to close to break-even in 4Q21. Coupled with working capital drain (inventory build-up to deal with parts shortages), we think this largely explains the reduced cashflow guidance.

PIRC IM,PIRC,Nov 12 2021 01:00AM,Pirelli & C.,Automotive,"3Q21: Quarterly beat and FY21 guidance raise, albeit on a (very) conservative implied 4Q21 ","Pirelli's 3Q adjusted EBIT stood 6% above expectations, while FCF exceeded thetriple-digit million euro mark in the quarter. ","FY guidance is raised thanks to better than expected overall price-mix vs inflation. Implied 4Q21 looks very cautious to us (declining revenues and margins) possibly reflecting the group's (too?) conservative communication for the past 18 months. 6% beat at EBIT level. In 3Q21, Pirelli revenues increased 10.8% (vs 3Q20, +2.4% vs 3Q19; more details in Exhibit 1) on flat volumes (-0.4% vs -5.5% for the industry), a double-digit price mix (40% o/w is pricing to offset price inflation) and FX was marginally positive. Adjusted EBIT margin increased by 4.6% (or c. 6% above expectations) driven by a positive price-mix net of raw material cost inflation (+€23m), with the other drivers having a combined negative -€9m impact. Another good quarter for FCF (+€104m vs +€12m a year ago). Interestingly, Pirelli keeps tightening its FCF generation, not at the expense of capex plans (-€71m in the quarter inc. right of use vs -€40m in 3Q20) but thanks to improved earnings (EBITDA of €320m vs €309m a year ago) and strict working capital management (-€62m in 3Q21 vs -€173m) mostly due to ongoing inventory monitoring. Guidance lifted but consensus is already there (mid-range). Pirelli has lifted FY21 revenue guidance, by +€0.1m, to at least €5.1bn on improved pricing (+7% vs +4.75% previously) as volumes are unchanged (+14.5% mid-range) and FX is set at the upper range of August assumptions (or -2%). Against this backdrop, they see the margin range as still achievable (15-15.5%) despite a more negative raw material cost impact (-3.6% of sales vs c. -3.% previously). New guidance implies 1/ a moderate increase to consensus expectations (adj. EBIT +0.5/+1%), and 2/ a tough 4Q (-5% in revenues/-17% in adj. EBIT vs 4Q20) that the group justifies by ongoing high volatility on OE (seen down -23% after -20% in 3Q), tougher comps (which we can't confirm looking at the past four years' numbers) and higher raw material costs (-€33m more unfavorable for the FY). We would expect a positive reaction at opening. The print is robust across the board and the new guidance hike might be a relief to consensus, which might be willing to look beyond the (too) conservative assumptions.

CON GY,CON,Oct 25 2021 01:00AM,Continental AG,Automotive Supplier,3Q21: underlying results are actually just in-line but the outlook is weak ,"Continental pre-released 3Q21 results last Friday, which initially appeared to bea decent beat vs consensus though underlying results are firmly in-line after considering delayed R&D costs and a positive one-off. While we had expected that CON would cut its outlook, we are negatively surprised by the weak implied 4Q performance, which points to even higher cost headwinds and a potentially larger than thought hit to light vehicle production volumes in 4Q. Moreover, incremental costs for energy and logistics will likely push FY22 consensus Rubber margin materially lower. ","3Q21 better than feared - but only at first sight: CON reported 3Q21 group revenues of €8,041m (1.5% ahead of consensus) and group adj. EBIT margin of 5.2%, which translates into an absolute EBIT of c€420m. Technically, this is a c39% beat vs. consensus (€300m, SFe: €285m), which, in our view, also explains the initial gains that the share later gave up again. The beat is solely driven by Auto with revenues in- line (€3,477m vs. cons at €3,474m) but EBIT of only c€-80m (-2.3% margin) vs. SFe at €-185 and consensus at €-174m. Yet, it can largely be explained by a positive one- off gain of €60m related to the Vitesco spin-off (unexpected by the sell-side) as well as lower incremental ADAS related R&D in AMS (only €30m in 3Q21 vs an expected 2H21 run rate of c€70m per quarter). Adjusted for these effects, Auto EBIT is almost a spot landing on SFe and consensus estimates. Rubber EBIT (c€496m, 11.3% margin) was bang-in-line with our and consensus forecasts. Results table overleaf. New outlook implies a strikingly weak 4Q performance: CON has also revised its outlook with the mid-point implying a c11.5% cut to group EBIT consensus expectations, largely driven by Automotive. An overview of the new guidance vs. SFe and consensus can be found on page 2. Auto: CON now sees 2021 global light vehicle production growth at-1% to +1% (IHS: +0.3%), Auto revenues of €14.5-15.5bn and adj. EBIT margin of -2.5% to -2%. At the mid-point, the outlook implies 4Q21 Auto revenues of c€3.6bn and adj. EBIT margin of c-7.5%, i.e. even worse than in 3Q21. We understand CON does not expect major negative one-offs in 4Q21 that would help explain the weak implied 4Q performance and with the guidance for excess logistics costs unchanged (€200m) and lower expected ADAS R&D costs (around €55m in 4Q vs. c€70m before) we believe the residual could reflect a further acceleration in semi costs (back in August, CFO Schaefer indicated a 2H21 burden of c€100m had been baked into the guidance). Auto guidance low-end with an interesting scenario for 4Q: We somewhat struggle to reconcile CON's revenue guidance with its LV production scenario, specifically at the low-end: a 1% decline in global LV production would still imply 4Q21 production of 17.96m units, up c8.8% sequentially vs 3Q21 while the low-end of CON's outlook implies 4Q21 Auto revenues of c€3.1bn (down c10% vs. 3Q21). Having spoken to the company, we understand CON sees a risk that OEMs could pull forward Christmas holidays on short component supply, which could result in 4Q revenues even below 3Q, and this risk appears to be largely concentrated in Europe. While such a scenario would suggest further estimate cuts across auto names, we note that in conversations we had last week with suppliers/OEMs, none has alluded to such a scenario but most have indicated that October trading would be on track to Improve vs. a weak September. Rubber guidance was also lowered to revenues of €17.2-17.5bn (was €17.2-17.8bn) and margin to 12.3-12.7% (was 12.5-13%) on higher raw mats (upped to €550m from €500m) as well as higher logistics and energy costs mainly hitting Tires. We think particularly energy costs have just started to bite and could turn out a major burden to FY22 Rubber margin expectations.",Alexander Wahl,"Alexander Wahl, CFA;Daniel Schwarz;Pierre-Yves Quémener",114,,Buy,,EUR,5.83,,8.51,,0.95,2.55,,,,,M,STIFEL_3Q21- underlying_FlashCoNote_Oct 25 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_3Q21- underlying_FlashCoNote_Oct 25 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=ea35ea59-eb50-4be5-9a0c-b1229b408b51&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

MTX GY,MTX,Oct 25 2021 01:00AM,MTU Aero Engines,Aerospace & Defence,"A Clearing Sky Ahead, Not a Darker One ","We upgrade our recommendation on MTU Aero Engines' shares to Buy (fromHold), increase EPS estimates to +3% / +3% / +8% above consensus for 2021 / 2022 / 2023, and raise our PT to €230 (implying a 28% TSR). e Previously, we were concerned about top-of-the-sector multiples, the risk of a slow MRO recovery, and ambitious consensus margin expansion. Our change of view is due to weak YTD share price performance, an improving shop visit outlook for volume and mix, and, similarly to our recent note on Airbus, likely benefits from escalation and in the medium-term, shifting Airbus mix towards the A32Tneo. e In summary, we see MTU as a revenue and cashflow recovery story, with a favourable bias towards the faster narrow-body and short-haul recovery. e We anticipate that pent-up demand for engine Maintenance, Repair & Overhaul (""MRO"") since the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, plus relatively strong recovery of domestic and short-haul traffic, are likely to drive both spare part revenues and MRO revenues (boosted by Independent MRO contract wins). Anecdotal comment from our industry contacts indicates a tightening MRO market in the US and Europe. Mix in its Commercial MRO business is likely to shift favourably towards higher-margin legacy-engine MRO. Finally, high commodity price inflation is likely to provide a materially-positive tailwind to pricing in coming years, we believe. e In 2021 YTD, MTU shares are down 15%, vs up 13% for the DAX index, and up 12% for the Stoxx A&D index. MTU shares trade around the top 4 of European A&D on most trading multiples, and they are very high vs its history, but we see this as justified by a projected strong EPS recovery CAGR of 23% (FY-20 to FY-23), benefiting from a depressed FY-20 base, and by low reinvestment needs (and rising cash conversion) going forward. ","EPS Estimates Raised Our new “Adjusted EPS” estimates are €6.20 for 2021E (up 2% vs €6.10 previously) and €8.30 for 2022E (up 13% vs €7.35 previously). The changes mainly reflect higher Commercial MRO margins, partly offset in FY-21 by lower OEM margins (though these are higher beyond FY-21). They are both 3% above company-provided consensus (of €6.02 for FY-21 and €8.05 for FY-22). On our new estimates, in FY-23, MTU's EPS regains its pre-COVID, FY-19 level. Our Q3-21 estimates are moderately above consensus, driven by OEM segment margins. Valuation and Next Event MTU shares trade at 22x 2022E EPS, falling to 17x 2023E EPS (vs. the Euro. Civil Aero. mean of 29x / 19x). On EV/FCF, reflecting MTU’s net debt and pension, it trades more expensively at 31x 2022E FCF, falling to 23x 2023E FCF (vs. peers on 30x / 21x). The next event is Q3-21 Results on Friday, 29 October 2021. Price Target Raised Our new PT is €230 (up 15% vs €200 previously). It is derived from our FY-23 EPS estimate of €10.45 (up 17% vs €8.90 previously), plus a DAX market multiple of 14x (unchanged vs 14x previously), plus a target P/E Relative of 158% (vs 162% previously), which is 0.75 standard deviations above its 10-year mean.

Group revenue growth outlook lowered, but margin targets remain conservative yet there is little upside to consensus SHA reduced the outlook for organic revenue growth to >7% from >11% before to reflect lower underlying light vehicle production but retained the margin outlook for the group (8-9.5%) as well as for the divisions. Considering 9M21 performance, divisional margin targets appear conservative, but consensus upside is probably limited: we think the 6.6% margin that we and consensus predict for Auto OE is in reach even if 4Q21 margin (SFe: 3.9%) drops vs. an inflated 3Q (see tax effect above), and we are also in-line with consensus for Aftermarket (target: >12.5%, SFe:14.2%, consensus 13.9%) and Industry (target: >10.5%, SFe and consensus: 11%). Overall, our group adj. EBIT sequence changes by c -5.6%/-10.2%/+2% for 2021-2023E as we reflect lower light vehicle production and input cost inflation in FY21/22.

For this reason, we stay on the sidelines and reiterate our Hold rating. Our price target declines to €7.60 (from €8.10) on lower estimates and is based on a 7x EV/adj.

AM FP,AM,Dec 17 2021 06:00AM,Dassault Aviation,Aerospace & Defence,"A Reversal of Fortune, But Unrecognised ","We reiterate our Buy rating on Dassault Aviation shares, modestly raise our FY-21EPS estimate on an underlying basis, and recalibrate our PT, with no underlying change, due to the 10-for-1 stock split, to €120 (implying a +36% TSR). We also include an ESG Assessment with this note. e In our view, Dassault's fortunes have improved considerably in the past two years: 1. Bizjet demand is clearly rising significantly, vs stagnation for much of the past decade. Bizjets are increasingly clearly the European A&D sector ""winner"" from COVID, witnessed by departures, book-to-bills and the used-market, which increases our confidence in our above-consensus Falcon delivery estimates of 35 in 2022 (vs. cons. of 31) and 45 in 2023 (vs. cons. of 37). 2. Recent Rafale export successes, with 128 commitments for new aircraft announced so far in 2021 (from the UAE, Egypt, France, and Greece), compare to its prior record order intake year of 60 in 2009. They remove a potential lull in deliveries from 2023 onwards and enable production to increase to 2.5 or even 3 per month over the medium term, which should benefit operating leverage and margins. e Yet compared to two years ago on 16 Dec 2019, its share price is 22% lower (vs +14% for the SBF 120 index and -26% for the Stoxx A&D index), and I/B/E/S median consensus Forecast Year 2 P/E is 11.7x, which is nearly 2 turns lower than 13.4x on 16 Dec 2019 — and the equity stub, ex-Thales, is at 0.6x Forecast Year 2 EV/EBITDA today vs 0.4x in Dec 2019. Clearly, liquidity remains an issue, but Airbus (AIR FP, Buy, €99.99) may yet sell down its residual 10% stake, and for investors with a tolerance for low-liquidity, it is, in our view, a very interesting stock to consider. e In sum, we view Dassault as a revenue and re-rating story, with a special situation angle. In our view, Rafale has clear export momentum, COVID is likely to drive greater propensity to travel privately, the traditional drivers of rising corporate profits and commodities are likely to be supportive, environmental issues are likely only to be a minor demand drag, new product launches (the 6X and 10X) are likely to help Dassault to gain share over time, and R&D declines from FY-23 should add tailwind to earnings growth. The equity stub (excluding the 25% stake in Thales) currently trades at 1x (one times) 2022E EV/EBITDA, which is in the 23rd percentile of monthly observations since 2009. e@ In2021 year-to-date, Dassault Aviation shares are flat, vs +23% for the SBF 120 index and +9% for the Stoxx A&D index. ","On an Underlying Basis, FY-21 EPS Estimate Raised, FY-22 Unchanged Our “Adjusted EPS” estimates are now €7.30 (2021E, up +4% vs €7.00 previously, after adjusting for the 10-for-1 stock-split) and €8.00 (2022E, unchanged vs €8.00 previously, after adjusting for the 10-for-1 stock-split). These estimates are in line vs and +7% above current I/B/E/S median consensus of €7.36 and €7.50, respectively.

This 2022 P/E represents 75% Relative to the SBF 120 index, which is 1.7 standard deviations below their 134% average over the past ten years. Excluding its 25% stake in Thales, the stub trades at positive 1x 2022E EV/EBITDA.

The revenue story benefits from the strong Civil Aero. aftermarket revenue growth in Q3 (at +44% y/y), and clear indications of strong Spares demand for November and recovering spare engine sales, and the cashflow story from the raised guidance. e The share price reaction (up +2% on Friday vs a flat CAC 40 index and a flat Stoxx A&D index) reflects, we believe, confidence on prospects for an aftermarket recovery as well as the FCF guidance increase. e In 2021 year-to-date, Safran shares are down 1%, vs +24% for the CAC 40 index and +12% for the Stoxx A&D index. Safran trades around the high end of European A&D on earnings multiples (though around the middle on FCF multiples), which we see as justified by our forecast for a very strong EPS recovery CAGR of 43% (FY-20 to FY-23), benefiting from a depressed FY-20 base, and lower reinvestment requirements (and thus higher cash conversion). ","Key Positives & Negatives Safran expects a restocking of spare parts by aero-engine Maintenance, Repair & Overhaul (""MRO"") shops in November and it has seen a ""Big inflow of orders for November"". The increase in guidance for LEAP engine deliveries to around 900 (vs 800+ previously) is partly due to more spare engine deliveries (which are at high margins, and which are, according to the CFO, ""a good part"" of their confidence in FY-21 guidance, with the CFO being ""very confident"" in achieving the margin guidance), and partly to removal of earlier conservatism about installed engine deliveries. The level of unutilised aircraft in the fleet with CFM56 engines has come down from 25% to 26% at the start of 2021 to 16% now. ""Most"" of the increase to FY-21 Free Cashflow (""FCF"") guidance is due to Rafale export contract downpayments for Safran's M88 engine. EPS Estimates Unchanged Our ""Adjusted EPS"" estimates are €2.60 (2021E, unchanged vs €2.60 previously) and €4.70 (2022E, unchanged vs €4.70 previously). These estimates are -6% below and +11% above current I/B/E/S median consensus of €2.77 and €4.25, respectively. Given that our FY-21 estimate is 3% above consensus at the EBIT level, we believe that the much larger and negative difference at the EPS level is mainly due to consensus not fully reflecting previously-announced impairments of €180m pre-tax (or ~€0.31/share, after tax) - if consensus reflects none of this, then like-for-like, our FY-21 EPS estimate is 5% above consensus. Valuation and Next Event Safran shares currently trade at 24x 2022E EPS, falling to 19x 2023E EPS (vs the Euro. Civil Aero. mean of 29x / 19x).

IRE IM,IRE,Nov 12 2021 01:00AM,Iren,Utilities,Accelerating low-risk growth ,"lIren's new business plan will provide more growth through sharp accelerationof investments. e@ Capex will continue to be mainly focused on networks and the waste business. Iren will cautiously expand in renewable power generation. e We increased our estimates. We forecast 7% average yearly growth in 2021-26 both at EBITDA level and at the bottom line. e We confirm our Buy rating on the stock. In our opinion, the new business plan restored confidence in Iren's value creation story. We raised our price target to | -- €3.50 from €3.20. ","Sharp capex acceleration will drive more growth in Iren's new business plan Iren's new CEO, Mr. Armani, presented a new business plan characterized by accelerating growth. The new plan is based on a sharp step-up in investments, which for the period 2021-26 are expected at €7.1bn. This figure implies that 5-year investments have been more than doubled versus the previous plan. The new business plan has a time horizon till 2030. In 2021-30 the company plans to invest €12.7bn. The risk level of the plan remained limited, in our opinion. Around 70% of total capex is forecast in regulated and quasi-regulated businesses (networks and waste). Accelerating capex is expected to translate into higher growth than in the previous business plan. Both EBITDA and net profit are expected to grow on average by 8% per year in 2021-26. In the period 2021-30 EBITDA is expected to grow on average by 7% per year, net profit by 8%. Expansion in renewables is the main strategic change of the new plan lren will pursue cautious growth in the renewable business, mainly through organic development of solar PV capacity. M&A is expected only for possible acquisitions of pipelines and not for acquiring operating assets. Iren targets to add 0.5GW of renewable capacity (mainly solar PV) by 2026, and 2.2GW by 2030. In our opinion, those targets are ambitious but achievable. Upside pressure on our estimates from accelerating investments We raised our EBITDA estimates, after including the contribution from the additional investments forecast in Iren's new business plan. On average, our 2021-26 EBITDA estimates increased by 7% per year. Our net profit estimates for the same period remained barely unchanged, due to higher DD&As linked to capex acceleration. On average we expect 7% yearly growth both at EBITDA and net profit level in 2021-26. Our estimates are lower than the company's targets. The new business plan restored confidence in Iren's value creation story We confirm our Buy rating on the stock. We think that the new business plan restored confidence in lren's low-risk value creation story after the recent change in management. It also provided visibility on the additional value-creation potential offered by the company in its businesses linked to the circular economy and on cautious development of renewable power generation capacity.

SIKA SW,SIKA,Nov 17 2021 01:02AM,Sika,Construction Supplier,Acquisition of MBCC and its impact on the setting of new strategic targets ,"The acquisition of MBCC could have a significant impact on Sika's growth,profitability and financial profile. Sika's strategic targets in 2023 will be reviewed in FY-22 and adjusted once the MBCC acquisition is concluded. In this report, we look at the ways in which these strategic targets could be set. e We furthermore try to answer the most-asked questions, e.g. where is the largest risk in terms of divesting parts of MBCC's business and is its investment grade credit rating at risk? e We considered the MBCC acquisition as of end of September 2022 in our financial model. Based on our unchanged valuation approach (DCF model and peer group valuation multiples), we increase our price target from CHF 345 to CHF 400 and reiterate our Buy rating. Sika secures its global market leadership in the construction chemicals market. ","The five most-asked questions about the MBCC acquisition - our answers Is Sika’s credit rating at risk after this transaction and / or is an equity capital increase necessary? - We don’t think so, no equity capital increase is needed, but potential early redemption of the convertible bond could increase flexibility and please credit rating agencies. Why didn’t Sika buy MBCC in 2019 when it was up for sale? - Being a CHF 9bn instead of a CHF 7bn sales company and after the successful integration of Parex, Sika is better prepared for the MBCC transaction than three years ago. Why is it buying MBCC for CHF 5.5bn when the price was EUR 3.2bn before? - Revaluation, timing and capitalised synergies more than offset the difference between Lone Star and Sika’s paid price. Are the targeted synergies of CHF 160m to CHF 180m achievable? - Sika always achieved significant cost margin improvements after high external growth periods. Will Sika have to sell significant parts of MBCC in order to get the approval from the competition commission authorities? - Some smaller disposals might be forced by authorities in North America and Europe, but the European Commission did not oppose the BASF-Lone Star deal. New strategic targets to be set - what we expect Based on our financial modelling, with MBCC being included in our estimates, we are reviewing the different parts of the growth strategy 2023. For new strategic targets (2027? To be set after the closing of the MBCC transaction?), we expect Sika to stick to its 6-8% growth target in local currency, would assume an unchanged EBIT target of 15% to 18% (but remaining at a 15% level in the coming two years), and a ROCE target of 25% (instead of >25%, to remain significantly below this level in the coming years due to higher intangible assets). Unchanged valuation approach - new PT of CHF 400 (prev. CHF 345) Our unchanged valuation approach - 50% DCF model with a fair value of CHF 385 and 50% EV/EBITDA of Swiss Industrials with structural growth (but now on FY-23 instead of FY-22 multiples in order to consider MBCC for 12 months) with a fair value of CHF 407 # indicates a new price target of a rounded CHF 400.

SANT GY,SANT,Dec 17 2021 11:05AM,S&T AG,Technology Hardware,Adding some background information ,"We had a conversation today with CFO Richard Neuwirth on backgroundinformation with respect to allegations made in the recent shortseller note released on Thursday. We summarize the main highlights as we understood them and conclude that if independent opinion on the matters comes to the result that allegations have no material impact or no impact at all, this could help S&T regain investor confidence. We continue to believe that management will further comment on the allegations in detail after a thorough review, which should take some time. This review should be accompanied by external audit where ","appropriate, in our view. Referring to some of the allegations in the shortseller note, our main takeaways were the following: On 'off balance-sheet entities' (OBE): Ukraine business: This refers back to holdings the company had back in the time before S&T (old) became part of S&T today (for details on the different transformation phases, please refer to page 19 in our initiation note). We understood that S&T (old) had 10% in the Ukraine unit which is now 5%. S&T as it is today has not received any dividends, but collected €35k annual license fees for usage of the name from the Ukraine entity. S&T wanted to end this, but was not in the position to do it contractually. CFO Neuwirth sees no legal fallback to S&T. On our request, he mentioned to check, if S&T supplies to this unit. We think this should be very limited, if at all. The value of the participation was mentioned to be €25k by the CFO. IMG China: The respective participation was indeed sold in 2010. There are no business relationships at all between S&T and this unit and the website content mentioned in the shortseller report was deemed outdated. e@ S&T has no other ‘hidden’ entities as ‘OBE’, according to the CFO. On Kapsch Carriercom Poland: Past legal claims were directed towards employees of the Polish unit, not the entity as such. The legal examination was focusing on a deliberate and undue delay of tender process bidding. The project in question turned out to be very unprofitable in hindsight and was finally executed by a rival of Kapsch and not by Kapsch itself. The topic refers back to 2017, i.e. before S&T acquired Kapsch Carriercom in 2019. On Roding Embedded: Formally, not a related party transaction as at this time, Mr. Wieczorek (previously in Supervisory Board) is no longer related to S&T. Surely, we think it was a transaction made between two companies with good knowledge of each other and of the buying and selling entities. Roding Embedded was said to be an entity disposed by Kontron before it was part of the S&T group, and hence comparable to the deals of Ubitronix and RTSoft. Thus, it was bought before the rest of Kontron became part of the S&T group. On ‘unsuccessful’ equity raise: This was due to warrants granted to US employees / management and was thus not an equity raise in the classical sense (amounts were too low anyway). On BASS Systems (Moldova): S&T admits that this was a failed deal, but has been resolved by sale in the meantime, which is a known matter. Management sees no legal claims falling back on S&T group.",Adrian Pehl,"Adrian Pehl, CFA",30,,Buy,,EUR,0.9,,1.35,,0.19,0.3,,,,,M,STIFEL_Adding some_FlashCoNote_Dec 17 2021 11-05AM.pdf,STIFEL_Adding some_FlashCoNote_Dec 17 2021 11-05AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=0a706075-1448-48b3-986c-c604f30a9adf&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
OHB GY,OHB,Nov 11 2021 01:00AM,OHB SE,SPONSORED RESEARCH Aerospace & Defence,Aero Turns The Corner ,"We re-iterate our Buy recommendation, nudge up our above-consensus FY-22EPS estimate and raise our PT to €50 for OHB shares (implying a 26% TSR) | following 9M-21 Results. e Overall, we view the new news, which was the Q3-21 figures, as good. Its key metric of EBIT of €11m was in-line vs our estimate of €12m, on sales that were 8% below (seemingly due to Q3 vs Q4 phasing). No representative consensus was available. Free Cashflow of €-24m was materially above our estimate of €-49m (due to a lower overall working capital outflow). It left FY-21 guidance unchanged (and the EBIT guidance was 6% below I/B/E/S consensus), but on the call, management expressed confidence that this could be exceeded. e It is a small positive for our thesis that OHB is a revenue, margin and re-rating story, with the revenue story benefiting from a higher FY-25 target, and the margin story benefiting from the turnaround of Aerospace (to its first positive margin since Q1-20), although margins at Digital compressed (as previously indicated) and Space Systems was affected by cost over-runs on 2 minor programmes. We continue to see OHB as an attractive play on secular growth in the Space market, particularly for institutional European customers, with a low correlation to the broad economic cycle and at attractive trading multiples. e The share price reaction (flat on Wednesday vs a flat MDAX index and up +1% for the Stoxx A&D index) failed, in our view, to understand the importance of the turnaround at Aerospace and the higher FY-25 goals. e@ In 2021 YTD, OHB shares are up only +3%, vs +17% for the MDAX index, and +18% for the European A&D Sector (as measured by the Stoxx A&D index). The shares trade only around the lower-middle of European A&D on any trading multiple (save FCF Yield, due to slightly lumpy cashflows), which we view as attractive, given their relatively high-in-sector EPS growth profile and low economic cycle correlation. ","EPS Estimate Increased for FY-22 Our Reported EPS estimates are €1.70 (2021E, unchanged vs. €1.70 previously) and €2.35 (2022E, up 5% vs. €2.25 previously). The increase is mainly due to higher margin estimates for Aerospace. These estimates are 6% and 17% above current |I/B/E/S median consensus of €1.61 and €2.02, respectively, with the main difference being in our more optimistic view of revenue growth. PT Raised to €50 Our new PT is €50.00 (up 4% vs €48.00 previously). The increase is due to a slightly higher FY-23 EPS estimate and target P/E Relative, partly offset by a much lower market P/E multiple. €50 implies that in one year's time, OHB shares could trade at 17x FY-23E EPS, which implies neither multiple expansion nor compression vs their current 17x FY-22E EPS. Valuation OHB’s shares trade at about 17x our estimated 2022E EPS and 13x 2023E EPS (vs the European Aerospace & Defence mean of 21x / 15x).

SIKA SW,SIKA,Nov 11 2021 02:33AM,Sika,Construction Supplier,"After the Parex acquisition warm-up, Sika now ready for MBCC ","Sika is acquiring the MBCC Group, the former BASF construction chemicalsbusiness from Lone Star Funds, for CHF 5.5bn (implies 11.5x EV/EBITDA 22E, or 8.5x EV/EBITDA after considering synergies of expected CHF 160-180m). ","This transaction will strengthen Sika's market share in the global chemical construction market from today's 10% to 16% by 2025 (previous target: 12% or CHF 80bn). We regard this transaction as very positive for Sika, securing its number one position. The paid acquisition price implies a reasonable multiple significantly below its own multiples (Sika is trading at 23.4x EV/EBITDA 22x). Sika has proven with the successful integration of Parex that the company can handle larger acquisitions. The timing looks right after the completion of the Parex integration and the large stimulus programmes ahead.

MBCC will strengthen and balance Sika's business portfolio: The acquisition will complement and broaden Sika’s product and solution offerings in four out of five core technologies: Concrete Systems will move up from 14% to 21%, Cementitious Systems from 26% to 28%, Thermoplastics Systems from 21% to 16%, Coating Systems from 12% to 13% and Adhesives Systems from 27% to 22%.

RWE GY,RWE,Nov 16 2021 01:00AM,RWE,Utilities,Ambitious but realistic growth plan to 2030 ,"Conclusion: RWE held its CMD yesterday and confirmed its leading position as a globalRenewables player. Investment pace in Renewables is expected to double to €3bn net annually until 2030, resulting in a Renewables portfolio of 31 GW of net capacity at the end of the decade. Not surprisingly, returns expectations in Renewables have been reduced, but spread for value creation is unchanged. Buy reiterated. ","Towards 50 GW net capacity by 2030 excluding coal...: excluding coal, generation portfolio is expected to grow to 50 GW by 2030, implying an additional 2.5 GW of net capacity each year over 2021-2030 on average. This is a 70% step-up to the previous official development plan of 1.5 GW per year. Around 85% of the new capacity will refer to wind/solar/batteries, and the remaining 15% will refer to ""flexible generation"" (mainly gas) and hydrogen. By 2030, out of the 50 GW, 31 GW will be represented by wind/solar/batteries (Sept 2021: 9.5 GW), and 19 GW by flexible generation (September 2021: 17 GW). ...implying €30bn net cash investments on the period: the 50 GW net capacity target by 2030 will require around €30bn of net cash investments, resulting from €50bn of gross cash investments and €20bn of proceeds from asset rotation (partnerships, farm-downs). This pace implies €3bn net each year, twice the previous official investment plan communicated in March 2020 and in line with what we expected in our July note (Capturing the full potential of Renewables). Investment plan fully financed organically: RWE does not expect any capital increase to finance its investment plan to 2030. Around 51% of cash requirements will be covered by OCF and around 31% by proceeds from asset rotation. The remaining <20% will be covered with new debt or with the potential sale of the 15% E.ON stake. New investment breakdown shows higher focus on solar: by 2030, solar capacity is expected to reach 8 GW versus around 250 MW currently. Onshore wind capacity is expected to reach 12 GW, a 5 GW increase vs 2020 levels. Finally, offshore wind capacity is expected to reach 8 GW, more than three times 2020 levels. Slightly reduced IRR expectations in Renewables: over 2021-2030, average project IRRs of 6% are expected by the Group. IRR range for offshore wind is reduced by 50 bps to 5.0 - 9.0%. IRR range for onshore wind/solar/batteries is 4.0% - 7.0% vs 4.5% - 9.5% previously. Still, despite lower returns expectations, RWE indicates that it has been able to decrease its WACC since last CMD, resulting in an unchanged guidance for value creation with a spread over WACC of 100-300bps. Overview of new guidance over 2022-2024: Guidance for 2022 is raised: mid-point for Core EBITDA is raised by 7% (+€200m) to €2.9bn, 6% above company consensus. Main upside relates to offshore wind, where new guidance reflects the high power price environment. Mid-point of Net Income guidance is raised by 4% (+€50m) and stands 3% above consensus. Guidance for 2023 looks more muted: mid-point for Core EBITDA is 2% above consensus, again driven by higher earnings expected in offshore wind, but guidance for net income stands 6% below consensus, mostly explained by an expected tax rate of 20% vs 15% assumed by the street. €5bn of EBITDA by 2030: RWE targets a Group EBITDA of €5bn by 2030, implying an average 9% CAGR on Core EBITDA. This guidance does not include any capital gain from farm-downs. Already by 2023, Core business (excluding coal/nuclear) will account for 95% of Group EBITDA, something we view as a positive valuation catalyst. Temporary pause in dividend increase: new dividend policy will see the dividend remain stable at €0.90 for an unspecified period, mainly explained by strong investment requirements in Renewables and disappearance of earnings from coal/ nuclear until the end of next year. We think the dividend could grow again from fiscal 2023 onwards (paid in 2024).",Martin Tessier,Martin Tessier,43.4,,Buy,,EUR,1.5,,1.66,,0.91,0.98,,,,,M,STIFEL_Ambitious but_FlashCoNote_Nov 16 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Ambitious but_FlashCoNote_Nov 16 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=909dac82-a201-42bd-a779-0112431b9847&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
RMS FP,RMS,Dec 08 2021 04:48PM,Hermes,Consumer Goods,Analyst day feedback — built to last ,"Hermés hosted its first-ever analyst day in Pantin earlier today focused on the long-term dynamics of its unique business model, the artisanal and integrated manufacturing characteristics of its Leather & Saddlery business (including a visit to a leather workshop) and corporate responsibility. ","Hermés has preserved its unique authentic artisanal model anchored on: (1) Best quality of desirable products that are made to last, to be passed down and repaired, (2) Control and transmission of manufacturing know-how (one artisan for one bag, from start to finish) in France, (3) Vertical integration and strict control of its supply chain. Confidence in the future. In addition to its highly integrated craftsmanship model, Hermés has retained an exclusive and regionally balanced store network, now complemented by a fast growing e-commerce channel (up triple digits in 2021 and on its way to reach €1bn revenues in 2-3 years, in our view) where 75% of customers are new clients attracted to categories like jewellery, fashion accessories, silk and perfumes. Demand for all its metiers remains very high, especially in Asia and the Americas as we go into 2022. Master of its own destiny. In the all-important leather category, Hermés continues to successfully balance new launches and variations of long-established models every year and manage well the added complexity of an expanded offer of 40 handbag models. The appeal of its iconic bags (Kelly, Birkin, Constance) remains intact and the new families have attracted younger customers to the brand. After a banner 2021, Hermés has a larger base and is now planning for +6-7% volume growth for leather goods going forward (vs. +7-8% previous target) since the rate of leather workshop openings should remain one per year (consistent with the 2010-2020 average). If the other métiers continue to grow at a faster clip, the weight of (higher-margin) leather goods could be reduced further (it came down to 47% of group sales in 9M21 from 50% of total sales in 2019). Sector-leading CSR credentials. Thanks to its low-emission artisanal production model, Hermés has one of the lowest GHG emissions among the CAC40 companies and clear reduction targets for scope 3 and 100% renewable energy use. Hermés has reduced the energy and water intensity consumption in the past 10 years, continuously improved the use of recyclable/sustainable materials and, we believe, has the best quality products designed to last (e.g. making repair services available to customers around the world). Hermés should close 2021 virtually on par with Gucci after another banner year... Even with an anticipated slowdown for Leather Goods in 4Q21 (due to low level of stocks at the end of Q3), we expect Hermés to finish 2021 close to the €9bn revenue mark, putting it relatively close to Gucci and Dior (with Beauty) and only behind LV and Chanel. The law of big numbers does not help mega-brands that must balance growth and accessibility, but we argue Hermés has a textbook product diversification strategy that has allowed it to reach a much wider consumer base without losing its iconic appeal or the loyalty of its traditional Western local clientele. Own e-commerce is growing fast off a small base and is enabling the company to recruit many new customers to the ‘Hermes world’. ..SO why Hold? Management reiterated today some of the messages given during the 3Q21 call, namely: (1) inventory levels at the end of September were very low for leather goods (especially in Asia) and should put a lid on Q4 growth upside, (2) accelerating opex inflation (step-up in hiring and communication costs in H2 as well as higher depreciation charges and adverse FX) may cap consensus 2H21 margin upside. Last, a rich starting valuation (16x 2022E EV/sales vs. 6.5x past 27-year average and market cap comparable to Kering and Rlchemont combined) suggests moderating returns ahead and greater upside elsewhere in our coverage.",Rogerio Fujimori,Rogerio Fujimori,1250,,Hold,,EUR,21.6,,24.2,,7.36,8.25,,,,,M,STIFEL_Analyst day_FlashCoNote_Dec 08 2021 04-48PM.pdf,STIFEL_Analyst day_FlashCoNote_Dec 08 2021 04-48PM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=42199ab8-ff63-409b-ad11-b701969a0cae&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
STM GR,STM,Nov 15 2021 01:00AM,Stabilus,Automotive Supplier,And the marmot greets you every day ,"STM shares closed c6% lower after it issued right-in-line results for FY21but guidance that fell short of outdated consensus expectations. Based on management comments, however, we see STM delivering on the guidance's high- end and consider the outlook a reflection of prudence and low visibility, just as it was last year. We reiterate Buy with a €76 (from €75) price target. ","Guidance falls short of consensus - just as it did last year Stabilus released preliminary FY21 (Oct-Sept) results last Friday that were fully in line with consensus expectations, but the shares closed c6% lower on the company's outlook. STM sees group revenues of €940-990m and adj. EBIT margin of 14-15%, which, at the midpoints, imply a c4.4%/5.6% cut to current FY22 revenue/adj. EBIT consensus. Yet, we think the outlook is mainly a reflection of the backend-loaded nature of global light vehicle production growth in STM's fiscal year, with a weak calendar 4Q and 1H22 while 3Q22 (STM's F4Q) will likely be the make-or-break quarter (IHS for STM's F1Q-F4Q22: -19.7%/-5.2%/+8.3%/+23.6%). In fact, management's comments during the conference call suggest their current expectations trend towards the upper end of guidance as they see Powerise growing in the teens (10% Powerise growth means c3% growth on group level) and outperforming LV production by a decent margin. If we used this as a starting point and assumed gas springs to grow at 3% and the Industry segment at 5% (a modest assumption), we would end up at group revenues of €992m, i.e. exceed the guidance. This reminds us of last year's initial outlook that implied consensus cuts (see note) but was later raised and maintained (STM is one of the few auto suppliers that raised guidance during FY21 and delivered on it despite a significant shortfall in production volumes). We expect consensus to fall somewhere in the upper half of the corridor (SFe: €981m) and lower our group adj. EBIT forecasts by c11%/1% for 2022/23E, mainly reflecting lower LV production and higher input costs in FY22. What we liked in the result set STM so far only published the preliminary results set but there were quite a few items we liked: 1) At a rate of 23.1%, organic Powerise growth outperformed global LV production by 15.5pp in FY21 and 10.2pp in F4Q. It grew across all regions (EMEA +12.6%, Americas +16.8%, APAC +80.8%) but APAC clearly stands out (+87% organic in F4Q) driven by higher take rates and model launches with both global and domestic OEMs. Accelerating growth in the underpenetrated market of China was a cornerstone of our upgrade last year, which we see fully backed by the results. 2) STM delivered a solid €88.6m FCF this year, but it was held back by higher inventories (finished goods that OEMs did not call-off and safety stock) of >€20m (inventory days were up to 53 days vs 5YA of 37), which should bring a tailwind once supply chains normalize. 3) STM's F4Q group margin was 14.7% despite a significant and widely unexpected volume drop in September (-27% y/y), and we understand that price hikes in the Automotive business will only start to bring support in coming quarters, i.e. have not helped to offset input cost inflation in 4Q. Valuation and catalysts We roll-forward our valuation and derive a slightly higher price target of €76 (up from €75) based on a blended average of a 9.5x EV/adj. EBIT 2023E target multiple (was 11.5x 2022E) and DCF (€88). We reiterate Buy on the expectation that continued growth in Powerise, decent cost control and improving sector sentiment as supply chains normalize will trigger a rerating. Our price target implies that STM will trade at c12x EV/ adj.

HFG GY,HFG,Nov 02 2021 02:52AM,HelloFresh SE,Media,Another quarter another guidance raise ,"HelloFresh's reported 3Q-21 results are better than consensus expectations atthe top line but a tad below on adj. EBITDA (~3% miss against VA consensus). More importantly, HFG raised its FY21 guidance, which now calls for FX-neutral revenue growth of 57-62%, 9.5% higher than the previous target when comparing the mid-points, which looks impressive, in our view. This should be taken as a first indication that HFG can continue to strive in a post-pandemic world. It should also eliminate concerns about potential supply-chain disruptions in 4Q, likely courtesy of HFG’s local sourcing strategy. Adj. EBITDA margin guidance of 9.25-10.25% was reiterated. Taking into account ~2.5% negative FX impact for the full year, we expect FY21E consensus to move up by ~4% on revenue. At the mid-point of the adj. EBITDA margin guidance (9.25%), we see upside potential to current FY21E adj. EBITDA consensus estimates of 5% / 10% (Refinitiv / Visible Alpha). ","e@ While we note that market expectations for the full year had moved ahead to a certain degree going into the print, Q3 marked another strong quarter and the increased guidance signals a high level of robustness of the business model. HFG continues to invest heavily in expanding its TAM by ramping up its production capacity and launching its offering in Norway and Italy — the latter arguably only in October. Furthermore, the company continued to grow via selectively M&A. HFG completed the acquisition of Yoofoodz in Australia in October and also took a 10% stake in Chefmarket, the leading online meal-kit provider in Russia. e@ Q3 revenue was up 45.9% to €1.42bn (FX neutral yoy growth 44.9%); this compares with company-collected consensus of €1.31bn and Visible Alpha consensus of €1.35bn, implying a beat of c.8%. The strong top-line performance was was driven by a combination of active customer growth (+39% yoy to €6.94m) and number of orders (+42% yoy to €27.59m). The 3Q contribution margin contracted by 4.2% to 22.5%. While this may be disconcerting at first glance, the development can be explained by the return to normal summer seasonality, following the exceptional, COVID-19 induced performance in summer 2020 and continued ramp-up in production capacity. Cost inflation only played a minor role, according to the press release. Adj. EBITDA decreased by 30% yoy to €79.8m, implying an adj. EBITDA margin of 5.6% after 11.8% in 3Q-20. VA consensus stood at €82.6m, which implies a miss of 6.3% A first look at the geographical performance shows that the US outperformed International, which is, however, reflected in lower margins as the company keeps investing heavily in the region. FX-neutral revenue growth in the US was 51% to €789m, equivalent to~56% of group sales. Adj. EBITDA came in at €48.7m, implying margin of 6.2% after 10.9% in 3Q-20. FX-neutral top-line growth in International was ~38% yoy and adj.

DMP GY,DMP,Dec 16 2021 01:00AM,Dermapharm SE,Pharmaceuticals,Another smart deal ,"Dermapharm SE announced yesterday the acquisition of C3 CannabinoidCompound Company GmbH (""C3-Group""), a leading player in medical cannabis products in Germany and Austria. Although C3-Group will likely contribute only c. 4% to Dermapharm group sales in 2022E, we consider this deal very positive for Dermapharm, both, from a strategic and a financial perspective. For an estimated 2x 2022E sales, Dermapharm gains access to a growing market, especially in Germany after the new Government has announced plans to further liberalise the medical cannabis market. After the successful Allergopharma acquisition and the remarkable BioNTech vaccine manufacturing contract, C3-Group represents another very smart deal struck by Dermapharm management, in our view. We reiterate our Buy recommendation and €105 PT. ","Who is C3-Group? C3-Group was founded in 2014 by Bionorica SE, one of the world's leading producers of herbal medicines based in Germany after having invested many years in the research and development of natural as well as synthetic cannabinoid products for medical use. Its main product is called dronabinol, a reimbursable prescription product indicated for a broad range of indications such as pain, palliative medicine, oncology and neurology. C3-Group also has two state-of-the-art GMP production sites in Germany for pharmaceutical grade active pharmaceutical ingredients (""APIs"") for both natural and synthetic cannabis and cannabinoid products. Additionally, C3-Group owns a comprehensive IP portfolio with several clinical trials underway. e@ Strategic rationale convincing, in our view: After having divested its minority stake in FYTA earlier this year, Dermapharm has nevertheless always expressed its strong interest in the medical cannabis market. Timing is perfect, in our view, given the new German Government's intention to liberalise the medical cannabis market in Germany, which is explicitly stated in the ""Ampel"" coalition contract. With this acquisition, Dermapharm, in our view, has found a very smart way to re- enter the medical cannabis market and with C3-Group it can actually lead the way here in Germany and Austria. Furthermore, Dermapharm strengthens its distribution capabilities given the strong footprint of C3-Group within the German and Austrian medical community focusing on chronic pain and other medical diseases indicated for use of medical cannabis products. Financials of the deal appear very attractive: C3-Group generated sales of c.€40m in its last financial year (ending March 2021). Dermapharm pays c.€80m upfront to the seller, which is the Canadian cannabis player Canopy Growth, which itself acquired C3-Group from Bionorica in May 2019 for €225.9m. Back then, C3-Group had five medicines on the market generating sales of €27.1m in FY 2018. We estimate an increasing demand for medical cannabis products generally, and with the liberalisation plans of the new Government in Germany in particular, so that a sales level for C3- Group of around €50m in 2022E is realistic, in our view. Dermapharm agreed to pay c.€80m upfront for 100% of C3-Group plus success-based milestones, which we estimate to be up to c. €40m in a blue-sky scenario (in which case Dermapharm may be happy to pay the extra money). In essence, Dermapharm pays c.2x 2022E sales (assuming a blended €100m all-in acquisition price and €50m sales in 2022E), which appears very attractive to us, especially in the context of the c.8x sales paid by Canopy Growth for the same asset some 2.5 years ago. In our opinion, the fact that Dermapharm’s CMO Dr. Jurgen Ott was with Bionorica for almost 10 years before joining Dermapharm in Oct 2019 may have helped in reaching an agreement with Canopy Growth. With a net debt/EBITDA leverage ratio of just 1.7x currently, Dermapharm intends to finance this deal by using available liquidity. Another way to assess the financial attractiveness of this deal may be to look at a far smaller listed peer to C3-Group, the German Synbiotic SE, which generated FY 2020 sales of €9.2m with a current market cap of c.€110m.",Marcus Wieprecht,Marcus Wieprecht,105,,Buy,,EUR,3.31,,4.06,,1.62,2.09,,,,,M,STIFEL_Another smart_FlashCoNote_Dec 16 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Another smart_FlashCoNote_Dec 16 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=7c91e45c-0d11-4f01-b3a6-aae3c205581f&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

MOR GY,MOR,Dec 13 2021 02:56AM,MorphoSys AG,Biotechnology,ASH summary: overall positive ,"MorphoSys presented additional clinical data for two key products at ASH overthe weekend: 1) Pelabresib maturing phase II data in myelofibrosis (phase Ill study is ongoing, read-out expected in 2024E) and 2) additional ""real-life"" data comparing Monjuvi against other most frequently used treatments in r/r DLBCL in a retrospective analysis (incl Roche’s ADC Polivy). We consider the clinincal update on both products as positive, in particular for Pelabresib as the good efficacy shown earlier in treating myelofibrosis patients appears to be durable while no safety signals emerged so far. Additionally, pelabresib provided some evidence for disease modifying potential. With regards to Monjuvi we like the outcome of a meaningful survival benefit versus other frequently used treatments, however, with all the caveats obviously coming along with a retrospective clinical analysis. We carry a rNPV for Pelabresib of €11.6 per share in our valuation SOP model (18% of our group PT), while Monjuvi accounts for €9.0 per share (joint marketing in the US with Incyte, royalties from sales generated outside the US). We believe MorphoSys shares are undervalued at current levels. Monjuvi increasingly emerges as a highly effective and safe therapy in r/r DLBCL with a strong competitive profile. Pelabresib on the other hand emerges as a very promising new therapy with potential to show disease-modifying effects in difficult to treat myelofibrosis patients. We keep our Buy rating and €64 PT. ","Pelabresib maturing phase II data confirming the potential in myelofibrosis: At ASH, MorphoSys presented the latest data from an ongoing Phase II study evaluating pelabresib as a first-line combination with ruxolitinib (current standard of care) for patients with myelofibrosis who had not previously been treated with a JAK inhibitor (JAK inhibitor-naive). As of September 10, 2021, the data cut-off, a total of 84 JAK inhibitor-naive patients have been enrolled and received the combination. The data showed 68% (n=57) of patients treated with the combination achieved a 235% reduction in spleen volume (SVR35) from baseline at week 24 and 60% (n=47) maintained SVR35 at week 48. Most patients also saw their symptoms reduced, with 56% (n=46) achieving 250% reduction in total symptom score (TSS50) from baseline at week 24. At the time of the data cut-off, 53 patients (63% of the 84 patients) were still on treatment. No new safety signals were identified in the study. Additionally, analyses from an exploratory endpoint presented at ASH 2021 showed reduction of megakaryocyte clustering in bone marrow and correlation with spleen volume reduction. Megakaryocytes are the cells in the bone marrow responsible for making platelets, and the clustering of these cells are one of the signs of myelofibrosis. Additional data from a Pelabresib monotherapy arm of this phase II study were presented as well, suggesting a meaningful efficacy of the drug in those even more difficult to treat patients. Across all cohorts, 28% of patients achieved TSS50. RE-MIND2 study confirms a strong competitive profile of Monjuvi in r/r DLBCL. At ASH, MorphoSys also presented a retrospective analysis comparing Monjuvi against other most frequently used therapies including polatuzumab vedotin plus bendamustine and rituximab (Pola-BR), rituximab plus lenalidomide (R2), and CD19 chimeric antigen receptor Tcell (CAR-T) therapies. Findings from the RE-MIND2 study indicated that tafasitamab plus lenalidomide resulted in statistically significant differences across several endpoints. Specifically, results showed: 1) the primary endpoint, overall survival (OS), was met with significant improvement observed for tafasitamab plus lenalidomide at 20.1 months compared to Pola-BR at 7.2 months (p=0.038), and 24.6 months for tafasitamab plus lenalidomide compared to 7.4 months for R2 (p=0.014); 2) a comparable median OS benefit was observed with tafasitamab plus lenalidomide at 22.5 months compared to CAR-T at 15 months without statistical significance; 3) objective response rate (ORR), a key secondary endpoint, was observed with statistical significance for tafasitamab plus lenalidomide at 63.6% versus R2 at 30.3% (p=0.013), 4) Tafasitamab plus lenalidomide also achieved significantly higher complete response rates (CR), a key secondary endpoint, at 39.4% versus 15.2% for R2 (p=0.0514).",Marcus Wieprecht,Marcus Wieprecht,64,,Buy,,EUR,-3.72,,-9.04,,0,0,,,,,M,STIFEL_ASH summary-_FlashCoNote_Dec 13 2021 02-56AM.pdf,STIFEL_ASH summary-_FlashCoNote_Dec 13 2021 02-56AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=87c92e36-4edf-4a34-8299-20f315a1f573&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

The share buyback program and the following cancellation of treasury shares were announced by the company's BoD in the past months. ","Conclusion: The share buyback program, along with the €0.9bn dividend distribution planned for 2022, will offer Atlantia’s shareholders double-digit remuneration potential over the next few quarters.

ATL IM,ATL,Nov 12 2021 01:00AM,Atlantia,Transportation,Atlantia ,Atlantia's Q3/9M-21 results were inline with our and consensus’ estimates at the,"EBITDA level, better than expected at the bottom line. Q3-21 top line and EBITDA grew by double-digits y/y, net of the deconsolidation of ASPI (now accounted for as a discontinued item). Like-for-like growth was mainly driven by toll road traffic and airport passenger recovery versus Q3-20, which was heavily affected by Covid. On a reported basis revenues declined by 29% y/y, but increased by 28% on a like-for-like basis. Reported EBITDA declined 20% y/y, and, on a like-for-like basis, EBITDA rose 30% y/y. Net profit was more than eight times higher than in Q3-20. Reported net debt declined 29% from year-end 2020, mainly as a result of the deconsolidation of ASPI's debt. Improving outlook for toll road traffic led the company to increase guidance for FY-21. We have a Hold rating on the stock. The announcement of a dividend policy and share buyback program in recent months represented positive news flow, in our Opinion, and we expect they should provide strong support to the share price in 2022. Nevertheless, we think that the strategic guidelines made public by the company continue to offer some risk for investors, particularly where external growth is concerned, due to the significant financial resources available at the holding company level after the anticipated disposal of the ASPI stake in 2022. Detailed Q3-21 results are as follows: Revenues declined 29% y/y to €1,784m (in line with our estimate); the tough comparison resulted from the deconsolidation of ASPI. On a like-for-like basis revenues advanced 28% y/y with growth mainly driven by recovering toll road traffic and airport passengers versus Q3-20, which was heavily penalized by Covid-19. Abertis reported Q3-21 results in recent days. In its network, toll road traffic increased versus Q3-20 by: 1) 18% in Spain, 2) 2% in France, 3) 8% in Italy, 4) 10% in Brazil, 5) 84% in Chile, and 6) 18% in Mexico. Airport passengers in the quarter recovered by 79% y/y at the Rome Airports and by 101% at Aeroports Cote D'Azur. Reported EBITDA declined by 20% y/y to €1,170m (slightly lower than our €1,202m estimate). On a like-for-like basis, EBITDA grew 28% y/y, mainly driven by toll road traffic and airport passenger recovery. Net profit in Q3-21 was more than eight times higher than in Q3-20, reaching €440m. It was 94% higher than our €226m estimate, mainly due to higher than expected contribution from ASPI's net profit. Reported net debt declined by 29% from year-end 2020 to €27.8bn, mainly due to the deconsolidation of the debt of ASPI. Actual net debt was 27% lower than at end 2020, standing at€31.7bn. Improving outlook for toll road traffic led Atlantia to improve guidance for FY-21. Toll road traffic is expected down by 5% versus 2019 (versus -8% indicated in August), while for airport passengers, guidance of -70% versus 2019 has been confirmed.

HRPK GY,HRPK,Dec 01 2021 01:00AM,7C Solarparken,Utilities,Attractive growth until 2024 ,"Owned portfolio is expected to reach 525 MW by end-2024, a target we deemhighly achievable given the firm's track record since 2014. e 7C Solarparken displays attractive valuation versus renewables peers, and an attractive positioning on small and medium-scale PV parks in Germany and Belgium. e We confirm our Price Target of €5.50 and our Buy rating. Over 2021-2025, we estimate an EBITDA CAGR of 8% and a Net Income CAGR of 15%. ","Towards 525 MW by end-2024 On November 25, 7C Solarparken showcased its growth strategy until end-2024. Owned portfolio will grow from 337 MW currently to 525 MW by 2024 (+188 MW). Around 75% of the growth will be realized in Germany and the remaining in Belgium, anew market for the firm since the end of 2020. Growth strategy will be continued, made from a combination of own development of solar parks and external acquisitions of project rights or already- operating parks. Financing strategy shifts from equity to debt The growth to 525 MW by 2024 will require around €150m of investments. Around 90% will come from debt (project finance, green bond, Schuldschein) and the remaining 10% (€16m) from a capital increase expected in 2023. This is a deviation from the firm's historical financing strategy, which was mainly based on new equity. Given the firm's track record and constant early-achievement of capacity targets, we think this capital hike could be realized earlier than expected. This switch from equity to debt is made possible thanks to an already solid capital structure, as shown by a currently high equity ratio of more than 35%. As such, leverage should increase from around 5x in 2024. 7C Solarparken is positively exposed to high power prices Management raised by €1.1m the EBITDA guidance for 2021, mainly on the back of current high power prices observed in Germany. Indeed, most of the firm's plants are granted spot prices when they stand above the reference FiT price. New guidance for 2022 already includes the positive impact from high power prices, but we think that consensus does not, making us believe that upwards revisions could come in the short term. Our estimates are in line with the firm's guidance until 2024. IRRs: capex inflation compensated by high power prices We like Management's transparency regarding the impact of cost inflation on project returns, which is estimated at 100-150bps currently. But at current power prices, project IRRs actually benefit from a 150 bps uptick, reaching around 4%. In a blue-sky scenario where capex normalizes to 2020 levels and power prices remain high, we estimate that equity IRRs could stand at around 8.25%. According to Management, total capex for a typical PV project is up by 21% versus normal levels observed in 2020. Unchanged Price Target of €5.50 and Buy rating reiterated We take into consideration the new objectives showcased by Management in the last CMD on November 25. Our Price Target is based on a DCF method until 2056, based on WACC of 3.8% and a portfolio of 525 MW by end-2024. We confirm our Buy rating as we think that the firm's new targets by 2024 look highly achievable given the firm's track record since 2014. Also, the firm has an attractive exposure to small and medium assets in Germany and Belgium, which we view as an efficient commercial hedge to global competition from large-scale players. Our Price Target implies EV/EBITDA of 13.1x in 2022, EV/MW of €1.63m and market cap./MW of €0.83m, hence an attractive discount to larger renewables peers.",Martin Tessier,Martin Tessier,5.5,,Buy,,EUR,0.14,,0.22,,0.11,0.11,,,,,M,STIFEL_Attractive growth_CoNote_Dec 01 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Attractive growth_CoNote_Dec 01 2021 01-00AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=711a70e0-4ff0-4320-9235-26761eb96768&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

SPIE FP,SPIE,Nov 11 2021 01:00AM,SPIE,Business Services,Becoming leader in the Netherlands ,Spie announces the acquisition of Worksphere in the Netherlands. We estimatethat it should add c.€450m revenue (+6.4% scope effect). Spie would thus become market leader in the Netherlands with c.€1.2bn revenue. We estimate that the ,"EV amounts to c.€200m based on a 10.9x EV/EBITA transaction multiple and a margin slightly above 4% (pre-synergies). SPIE expects Worksphere's margin to reach c.6% within 18-months, implying a 7.4x EV/EBITA multiple post synergies according to the company. The closing is expected in Q1-22. Overall we see this deal as very positive: it strengthens Spie's positioning in one of its core regions, with very little dilutive impact on margins and deleveraging in the short-term. About the target: Worsphere is the technical facility management subsidiary of Rail and Civil engineering company Strukton. Worksphere is among the top 5 largest competitors in the Netherlands, with 1,900 employees and c.€434m revenue in 2020. e@ We estimate a c.€200m EV, which should be largely self financed: Spie guides for 10.9x EV/EBITA transaction multiple (pre-synergies). We estimate €18.5m EBITA in 2021 based on a margin ""currently slightly above 4%"". Spie also targets €9m cost synergies over 18-months, which should bring down the transaction multiple to 7.4x. Assuming consolidation from the middle of Q1-22 the scope effect for 2022E would be c.+5.6%. As we were forecasting bolt-on M&A, that would be at least a net +4% upside to our 2022E revenue. It would also imply +3% upside to EBITA and EPS adj. (i.e. excluding any transaction fee). These impacts conservatively assume a slow ramp-up of synergies, which we expect to be mostly unlocked in 2023E. A limited impact on leverage: We assume a €200m EV for Worksphere, and we exclude any additional bolt-on acquisition in 2021 (vs. an initial budget of €80m). The press release mentions that Worksphere has a ""highly cash-generative profile"". If we assume that its NWC is as negative as Spie's, then the acquisition should have a very limited impact on the deleveraging, and we would expect -0.3x de-leveraging in 2022E. If we assume that Worksphere has 0% NWC/Sales, then we can expect the deleveraging to be limited to -0.2x. Finally, if the target has c.10% NWC/Sales, we would still expect a -0.1x leverage.

STLA IM,STLA,Dec 06 2021 01:00AM,Stellantis N.V.,Automotive,"Beyond ‘Software Day’, this is a '22/'23 play ","Stellantis is hosting a Tech Day Tuesday, 7 December to detail its softwarestrategy. The event agenda and reach have not been set, but investors would welcome ""GM like"" details on new business opportunities. e CMD has been pushed back to next year: mid-to-long term targets, capital allocation and Chinese reboot should therefore be detailed early 2022. e With this note, we marginally trim our EPS sequence by an average 4% through 2023 and marginally scale back our target price to €24. ","Could Tuesday's Software Day move the share price? On 7 December, Stellantis will be hosting its 2nd Techno Event in 2H21. Stellantis should walk investors through their Software Strategy, in an attempt to convince them that it has entered the “software-defined car"" era. Capital allocation for software is already disclosed and included in the €30bn 5-year planning 2025. Tuesday's event playbook is not clear, but investors would be keen - beyond technology prowess and promises - to get a sense of potential monetising from digital inroads and addressable wallet for the company. To that respect, if Tesla remains the pacemaker, GM has set a (communication) benchmark among legacy providers in early October 2021. CMD pushed to 1Q22: what we have learned so far Many ""isolated"" building blocks have been provided by Stellantis since January but the decade-long strategy has yet to unveiled in a fully-fledged event which should be hosted early 2022 (expect targets/timeline). So far, 1)group has sketched its EV strategy in July (platforms, chemistry, aspirational market share and 5 Giga factories); 2) In a more fragmented way, the group has also indicated some industrial rationalisations (Italy, Germany, US) which must be put into the perspective of the bigger picture, and 3) Finally, the basis for a FinCo has been laid with the acquisition of FIFS (Houston, TX) last September. Therefore, the only two large topics remaining are the Chinese reboot and future capital allocation on which we currently have little information. 21-23 EPS sequence lowered by an average -4% on (still) poor semi visibility We have revisited our EPS sequence, lowering it, on average, by -4% through 2023 following 3Q21 print and our revised macro scenario. While mix and price, should remain supportive till year-end, visibility still seems limited on the pace of semiconductor supply improvement. Our new FY21 revenue estimate lands south of €150bn with 1) an adjusted EBIT margin 50bps above guidance (of c.10%), and 2) a FCF impeded by WCR absorption as production might not have normalised (trade payables headwind exceeding the inventory tailwind). FY22 (geared to the 2nd half) and FY23 should see significant earnings recovery (+19% CAGR) driven by volumes, synergies from the merger (€5bn) implementation and, to a lesser extent by price (as for mix, we see it broadly flattening). EPS/FCF growth, solid execution could support a multiple expansion Whether the Software Day could move the share price remains to be seen. However, the earnings release next March (STLA is a ""delivery play"") and forthcoming 2022 CMD are two tangible catalysts. We see an EPS CAGR of 19% in '22-'23 and an average €9bn FCF generated per annum. Our target price is set at €24, derived from a mixture of past multiples (a FCA/PSA blend), peer multiples, and DCF. On our target price, stock would still trade at on 5.7x 22E P/E, which is still a significant discount to US peers GM or Ford (trading at 8.5x/8.4x22E P/E respectively)",Pierre-Yves Quéméner,Pierre-Yves Quémeéner;Daniel Schwarz,24,25,Buy,,EUR,3.67,,4.22,,0.94,1.31,,,,,M,STIFEL_Beyond 'Software_CoNote_Dec 06 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Beyond 'Software_CoNote_Dec 06 2021 01-00AM,COMPANY REPORT,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=38dcc824-21b4-49dc-b3a6-6f17eeb96d65&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
COK GY,COK,Dec 01 2021 12:12PM,CANCOM SE,IT Services,Big 2025 targets leave some open questions ,"Cancom held a CMD providing a strategy update post the sale of the UKbusiness earlier this year and releasing its Vision 2025. e The targets read ambitious to us: €2.5bn sales, €275m EBITDA and €450m ARR by 2025. This implies a sales / EBITDA CAGR of 16.3% / 22.4%, split roughly evenly between organic growth and M&A effects. e We update our estimates to reflect the new structure going forward, i.e. excluding the UK + Ireland business that was sold in July. e To reach the growth and margin goals, Cancom will need substantial M&A contributions. Funding is in place for now, but finding the right targets provides a challenge, in our view. e We confirm our Hold rating with a new price target of €62 (from €52) on the back of increased mid-term estimates and the higher net cash position post the UK +] sale. ","Continued focus on managed services Cancom provided a strategy update and elaborated on current trends in the sector. The goal is to transform the business into a system house 4.0, that is become a leading hybrid IT service provider offering extensive managed services. The share of ARR is expected to increase from 12.5% in 2020 to 18% in 2025, including acquisitions. The main drivers behind ARR growth are new hybrid work styles that have strengthened during the pandemic. Cancom sold the UK+lreland business in July this year for an enterprise value of ~€393m, achieving an EBITDA multiple of 15.8x. Including the proceeds from the sale, Cancom will end the year with ~€650m net cash. Part of it will be spent on a share buyback program for a maximum of €230m. Deducting some €100m for working capital, leaves €550m+ of M&A firepower as also shares will be used as M&A funds. Another focus point was the new sustainability strategy: Cancom plans to reach emissions neutrality by 2027 and further increase its ESG reporting standards. High uncertainty in Q4 and into 2022 As usual, Q4 will be the most relevant quarter of the year, accounting for c.30% of annual revenues. We cannot measure a potential pull-forward effect on the client side, which might have had an impact on Q3 numbers. Consequently, the usual budget flush in the public sector (~45% of sales) might be less pronounced than in the past given companies’ awareness of supply shortages. Cancom should still reach its guidance given the low comparison base in the CS segment. The last seven quarters (3Q21 - 1Q20) read as follows: 63 / 55 / 58.9 / 42 / 60.4 / 52.8 / 57.2. Therefore, >10% growth of CS in FY21 should be doable although growth stood at 3.8% after 9 months. In the ITS segment, comps are more demanding, but the company laid a good foundation to reach dd growth in FY21 with +15% y/y after 9 months. Valuation & catalysts We value Cancom based on a peer group (50% weight) and DCF analysis (50% weight). peer group derived FY22E EV/EBIT multiple of 19.1x yields an equity value of €61. We add a DCF, which yields a value of €62 to our analysis to arrive at our new price target of €62. With >€550m firepower, M&A arguably provides potential upside risk. On the downside, we see risks of continued supply chain issues well into 2022 and the usual M&A-related risks.",Yannik Siering,Yannik Siering;Chandramouli Sriraman,62,,Hold,,EUR,1.5,,1.77,,0.6,0.7,,,,,M,STIFEL_Big 2025_CoNote_Dec 01 2021 12-12PM.pdf,STIFEL_Big 2025_CoNote_Dec 01 2021 12-12PM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=7c445681-42c1-4b77-a237-f73f91b0d0ec&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

While the award of the project by year-end was somewhat expected, Prysmian’s share is larger than expected, further raising in our view visibility on the mid-term prospects of the Projects division (€4bn order backlog at end-September), with a good associated level of profitability.

The project involves the turnkey installation of one to three 500 kV HVDC links, each one 500km long, of single-core cables with Mass Impregnated insulation and double wire armouring. The submarine and land cables will be manufactured at the Arco Felice plant (Naples). Delivery and commissioning are expected in FY25-28. While the award of the project by year-end was somewhat expected, Prysmian’s share is larger than forecast (we were expecting the Tyrrhenian Link to be potentially worth up to €1.5bn), further raising visibility on the mid-term prospects of the Projects division. In terms of profitability, based on the size and complexity of the project, we assume an EBITDA margin of at least 20%. Lastly, we expect Prysmian to cash in the first downpayment by year-end, additionally raising visibility on the group’s FY21 FCF guidance of €300m +20% (vs. our estimate of €362m). Projects: time to execute ... Prysmian’s Projects segment was already sitting on record €4.0bn order backlog (>€5.6bn if we include recently awarded contracts) as at end-September: management recently confirmed that intense tendering activity is ongoing, with a solid pipeline of new projects (both interconnections and offshore wind farms) ahead (some other medium-sized projects may be awarded by year-end). The US market also seems to be finally accelerating, with the recent awards of the biggest single HV project (US$900m SOO Green HVDC Underground Link) and the largest ever submarine project (€630m Dominion Energy Group offshore wind) for the company, while the group also received this year (after many delays) notice to start executing the Vineyard offshore wind farm (the first large-scale offshore wind farm in the US). We reiterate our positive stance on the stock, with a €38.50 price target, providing 16% upside potential. The group, in our view, is strongly positioned to benefit from Energy Transition, with a projected acceleration in investments both for interconnectors and offshore wind projects (driven by Europe). The US infrastructure plan should give further boost to end-demand, as most of the company’s businesses, in our view, are directly or indirectly correlated to the planned step-up in investments.

SIX2 GY,SIX2,Oct 20 2021 07:28AM,Sixt SE,Transportation,Blow-out guidance raise ,Q3 21 a 12% beat over consensus,"Sixt has pre-released Q3 21 figures and refreshed its 2021 outlook in an ad-hoc update today. The date for publication was set at 11 November 2021. Given the strong dynamic with regard to car rental pricing (RPD), investors may not be surprised by the pre-release, but the magnitude of the beat is still strong vs. our model assumptions: Q3 21 EBT €253m vs. SFe: €240m (5% better, consensus compiled by the company was said to be €226m, 12% beat). September quarter sales of €795m (cons. €806m and SFe: €813m) was below expectations, but we believe investors should focus on the strong 31.8% EBT margin (SFe: 30%). Outlook for 2021 up a third at the midpoint The company outlook for 2021 is now lifted to €2.1bn-€2.3bn (up €100m at the mid-point vs. previous outlook) on the sales side, but in particular the 2021 EBT forecast is now €390m-€450m (vs. SFe: of €357m, highest in consensus), up from €300m-€330m and should be seen as very strong (+33% at the midpoint after +54% already on September). The increased span of €60m (up from €30m) suggests still some uncertainty around November and December. However, recall from our recent initiation note that the Europe to US route should open up in November and likely provide further support for Sixt. Buy rating maintained on growth drivers We think raising the outlook further by this magnitude is outstanding with Q4 suggesting EBT of €73m-€133m (SFe: €53m). Sixt should thus beat the Q2, with €78m most likely. As regards further outlook comments, Sixt refers to chip shortage and vehicle supply being major influences. Depending on how the situation normalises, 2022E consensus may not alter that much compared to 2021E. However, the increased profitability is already reflecting in the share price today.

On the positive side, the company could achieve a first settlement in the Chinese Solar projects by terminating the ClGSlab contract and is now working on concluding the ClGSfab contract, providing a positive EBIT result in Q4 2021E or Q1 2022E. Furthermore, restructuring is on its way in Electronics Components and Contract Manufacturing. Energy Storage was below our estimates in Q3, caused by project delays on customers’ side. Momentum is picking up in Q4 again. Here, namely, the BMW order provides further upside potential in 2021E. The CMD held jointly with Q3 results shed more light on the future opportunity arising from the BMW order. Besides the initial cell production line directly for BMW, Manz is then qualified for BMW's cell production in general, which significantly increases the likelihood of follow-up orders from BMW suppliers and opens a large order pool going forward. More so, Manz qualifies for further cell-to-pack assembly lines directly for BMW, which we think could translate into further significant triple-digit order intake over the coming years. We cut our revenue and EBIT estimates by 6% and 23%, respectively. Due to the recent order from BMW and, with that, increasing optimism about future EV orders, we keep our price target unchanged at €71. lot of optimism from the management call and CMD The tone of Manz's conference call and the CMD the company held in parallel, was optimistic, especially the details of further cell-to-pack lines and overall certification for BMW; both are promising news. Find our key takes below: Manz sees more potential coming from the recently acquired BMW order. The company now qualifies to provide cell production equipment to potential BMW suppliers. In addition, the company also qualifies for providing the cell-to-pack production equipment for BMW's future EV plants. Overall, we see potential in the €bn area over the decade. The Solar projects with the Chinese customer are partly settled now as the ClGSlab is terminated and ClGSfab is under negotiation, with the potential to gain another quite attractive one-off in Q4 2021E or Q1 2022E.

Manz delivers electrode coating and battery cell assembly together with its Chinese partner Yinghe. Clearly a sign that both cooperations with Yinghe since 2020 and GROB since 2021 are beneficial. Furthermore, we see the BMW order as a ","key catalyst for the story and shows that German premium OEMs rely on Manz’ technology, hence we are convinced that further German and European OEMs will follow.

HOT GY,HOT,Nov 08 2021 03:30AM,Hochtief AG,Construction,Bolt Out Of The Blue ,"Hochtief released a profit warning late Friday evening raising important questionsabout communication, other latent risks within this rather complex group and its ability to pay a full dividend this year. For us this event highlights the not insignificant risks the Group faces because of its complex structure and that steps to simplify this structure are a prerequisite for any outperformance. The order book and trading may be improving, but this isn't really enough, in our view. Management needs to de-risk the business further with clear measures and structural changes considered and put in place. Communication needs to improve at all levels to rebuild investor trust and confidence. Friday's event appears to be quite counter-productive with regard to this. ","What was announced? Hochtief released a profit warning late Friday evening relating to arbitration proceedings of the Chilean Alto Major hydropower project’s termination in 2017. Apparently, the release came immediately after the Group was informed about the arbitration results. The €195m one-off cost impact on nominal profit comes as a complete surprise, as the Group didn’t mention provisions or quantified the potential impact regarding this risk to us before. Although there was a mention of this potential risk in the annual report, no details or figures were provided. According to IR, the Group apparently had a counter-claim against the client, so that it could have gone the other way as well. e@ What is the impact? For FY21, we expect the nominal profit to reach €495m, before this €195m one-off impact. €147m will be cash effective, hitting the Group’s cash position and possibly impacting our SOTP by ~€2.1/share before any other one-offs. It could also impact the dividend, as the Group's 65% pay-out ratio is based on the nominal net profit. That said, the dividend may benefit from other one-off gains such as the Ventia IPO. The dividend may hence still be paid, in line with expectations, but this still needs to be seen. The one-off does not impact the operational net profit guidance of €410-460m, as it excludes one-offs. e@ What should happen? We believe the Group is too complex, resulting in a much higher risk profile than for most other contractors. We believe Friday's announcement is further evidence of this. In our view, the Group needs to simplify its structure and reduce its risk profile. Some steps in that direction have been undertaken, but much more could be done. There is no need for three separately listed entities, while an increased strategic focus would also help. ACS (Not covered) wants to move further into concessions, possibly expanding its Abertis position. We are not so sure about such a move and its impact on Hochtief. In addition, we believe that some assets such as Ventia could be fully sold. There is lots to do in the Group, and we think that putting forward a coherent plan would help to increase investor confidence and hence interest.",Tobias Woerner,Tobias Woerner,77.5,,Hold,,EUR,5.98,,6.59,,3.9,4.3,,,,,M,STIFEL_Bolt Out_FlashCoNote_Nov 08 2021 03-30AM.pdf,STIFEL_Bolt Out_FlashCoNote_Nov 08 2021 03-30AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=b1f2901c-4d1a-4619-986a-35372413548d&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
POM FP,POM,Dec 16 2021 01:00AM,Plastic Omnium,Automotive Supplier,Bracing for a new narrative ,"With this note, we update our EPS sequence by -17% through 2023 and ourlower our target price lowered to €25 (from €30). e After a rough 3Q21, combining a presumed setback in the race for Hella (August) and capitulation on its FY21 outlook (September), PO seems to be back to square one. e Beyond the expected restocking (starting 2H22) and the interesting hydrogen bias, investors might require a new narrative before revisiting a stock which is still heavily geared to the old world (one-third of revenues are ICE-related). e We retain our cautious stance and Hold rating on Plastic Omnium. ","Updating our model post 3Q21 and our revised macro assumptions We align our 2021 estimates with the revised company outlook looking for an operating margin of 4-5% on unspecified revenue seeing ""growth compared to 2020"". Going into 2022/23, we model a significant earnings recovery (starting 2H22), albeit one hindered by expected broad-based cost inflation (raw mat, energy logistics, labour). transitioning company Having presumably lost the race to take over Hella, Plastic Omnium remains significantly geared to the old world, with approximately one-third of revenues directly derived from ICE-related sales (fuel or urea tanks, be it for pure thermal or hybrid vehicles). We still assume that PO is actively chasing the right opportunity to change focus, screening for the right regional, technological and decarbonising fit. In that regard, the group balance sheet is solid (ND/EBITDA <1x) and the majority shareholder (Burelle family owning 59.4% of interest) could support - if required - a capital increase as long as they retain control over the new entity. Regarding HBPO’s future HBPO is a JV (67% owned by PO/33% by Hella) that takes in the group's front-end module developments (20% market share claimed). Should the Faurecia deal (on Hella) go through as planed, POM will have one month post-closing to decide what to do with the 33% it does not own in HBPO. We understand that management sees big upside on modules beyond their “bread and butter” front-end business (especially with BEVs). In that respect, having full control (vs two-thirds currently) of what is currently known as HBPO could make sense. new division Hydrogen focuses created Group operates its business around two reporting entities (Industries vs Modules) which is further categorised between ""HBPO"", ""IES"", ""CES"" and New Energies (""NE""). The latter has been spun-off from CES as the group channels more resources to hydrogen mobility for all forms of transportation (light vehicles and beyond). PO targets €0.3bn of hydrogen derived revenues in 2025; rising to €3bn in 2030 ""with accretive"" contribution, according to latest management comments. Hold reiterated We cut our three-year EPS sequence by an average -17% from a low base, especially in 2021/2022. Our target price reduction (almost) tracks our revised EPS trend.

KER FP,KER,Dec 07 2021 12:00AM,Kering,Consumer Goods,Brand heat update - October/November ,"Gucci sales momentum set to improve in Q4. Gucci brand heat data for October andNovember do not reveal any major changes in trends, except for some search data pick-up on Google Trends in November. We are still looking for signs of stronger brand buzz for Gucci on the back of the recent 'House of Gucci' movie release, strong commercial activity behind its 100th anniversary and the greater appeal of a broader Aria collection with rising ASP's that could drive further price-mix gains in Q4. We expect Gucci to benefit from sector-wide improving two-year stack growth rates in Asia in Q4 (especially in China and Japan, both of which were more meaningfully disrupted by COVID in Q3) and Europe (as long as stores remain open in December) as well as continued demand strength in North America. YSL & Balenciaga should remain among the clear market share winners in the sector in Q4. This is based on further sequential acceleration in October-November on Google Trends and strong momentum on YouTube (Balenciaga) and Weibo (YSL). We stick to our Buy rating on Kering as we go into 2022 for three key reasons: (1) we see sales momentum for Gucci improving sequentially thanks to intensifying product and marketing activities as we go into 2022 and sector-wide improving trends in Asia in Q4 vs. Q3, (2) YSL and Balenciaga should remain among the biggest market share winners in our coverage, (3) attractive valuation versus peers. COVID restrictions remain the main source of uncertainty in the ST. ","Gucci brand heat update for Oct-Nov. After a soft October, Gucci's momentum picked up in November on Google Trends. On Weibo and Instagram, trends are broadly unchanged, with Gucci remaining among the top four brands on both platforms (along with LV, Chanel and Dior). We saw no major changes on October brand engagement data from Tribe Dynamics, where Gucci has remained among the top four brands in the last three months. Last, Gucci's growth momentum on YouTube followers/views has modestly slowed in Q4 to date. We expect stronger brand buzz in December after the 'House of Gucci’ movie launch in late November and given all the commercial activities behind its 100th anniversary. YSL brand heat update for Oct-Nov. YSL has enjoyed positive momentum on Google Trends, with a marked sequential acceleration in Q4 to date. YSL’s very strong growth momentum on Weibo has been sustained in Q4 to date. On Instagram, YSL’s growth rates have also been maintained in Q4 to date. On YouTube, YSL’s growth rates remain very high, albeit slowing sequentially. BV and Balenciaga brand heat update for Oct-Nov. Both brands enjoy positive momentum on Google Trends (especially BV) while Balenciaga enjoys strong growth acceleration in YouTube followers/views in Q4 to date. Balenciaga moved to the top of the Lyst ranking of hottest fashion brands in 3Q21. It's all about the rate of change of growth for Gucci. On 16/11, Gucci CEO Marco Bizarri said that he expects Gucci 2021 revenues to be ‘in-line or a little higher’ than their 2019 levels. Current 2021 sales consensus of €9.3bn reflect sales broadly in line at constant rates with 2019 (considering c.-3% FX impact in L2Y), so Q4 consensus upside depends on Gucci retail sales coming ‘a little higher’ instead of ‘in-line’. We were encouraged by the ripple effect from the recent 'House of Gucci’ movie release on Gucci product searches on fashion platforms like Lovethesales.com (source: WWD, 26/11/21) or ShopStyle (source: Fashionista, 02/12/21) as we enter the most critical shopping weeks of the year. Next catalyst: FY21 results due 17 February 2022. We currently model +15% y-o-y retail growth for Gucci for 4Q21 (+6% two-year growth vs. +2% in 3Q21 and +11% in 2Q21).",Rogerio Fujimori,Rogerio Fujimori,840,,Buy,,EUR,25.8,,30.2,,10,11.7,,,,,M,STIFEL_Brand heat_CoNote_Dec 07 2021 12-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Brand heat_CoNote_Dec 07 2021 12-00AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=c7e0be2a-a45b-4524-913f-a90d7a8914bf&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
VAR1 GY,VAR1,Nov 05 2021 02:58AM,VARTA AG,Technology Hardware,Brave New World: Guidance cut and muted future growth weigh on sentiment ,"VARTA issued a profit warning this morning, cutting revenue guidance by 4.3%and adj. EBITDA guidance by 2.5% for the full year (revenue: €900m vs €940m; adj. EBITDA €275m vs €282m). The main reason behind the action is the delayed launch of new customer projects, Apple we assume, and overall issues in TWS production in Asia, caused by regional lockdowns. While the development was in line with company expectations, deviation from company collected consensus was too high with 7.5% and 6.8% for revenue and adj. EBITDA respectively in M9, which translates into a a c.18% and 15% miss in Q3 respectively. We assume that VARTA could only sell around 35m battery cells in Q3 vs our initial estimate of 65m and assumed consensus estimate of 45m. Furthermore, the company guides for further growth of €100m in 2022E and 2023E, which is significantly below consensus (-12% and -15% respectively). Therefore, the profit warning and the outlook for the coming years are in line with our Sell rating of slowed down growth in the CoinPower business.

DMP GY,DMP,Nov 12 2021 01:00AM,Dermapharm SE,Pharmaceuticals,Brighter outlook for vaccine business triggers earnings and PT increase ,"We reiterate our BUY rating on Dermapharm SE shares and raise our PT to €105 pershare (up from €93 previously). Our higher PT is driven by higher near-term earnings estimates, in turn driven by our more optimistic view on vaccine sales as well as a slightly lower WACC for our DCF model (c.6.0% versus 6.1% previously). This is a result of a slightly lower risk-free rate (1.00% vs 1.75% previously) and a slightly higher beta-factor (0.95 vs 0.90 previously) applied now. @ We increase our FY 2022E/23E adj. EBITDA estimates by 9%/4% as we now expect vaccine sales of €250m/€220m in FY 2022E/23E, up from €181m each year previously. Global mRNA vaccine demand remains strong as Pfizer/BioNTech recently guided for 4bn doses to be manufactured in 2022E after having raised its FY 2021 production guidance to 3bn. We believe Dermapharm remains a key supplier within the BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturing network after having boosted its annual capacity to 500m doses annually from FY 2022 onwards. @ We expect Dermapharm to report an improving 9M 2021 earnings momentum on 16 Nov, driven by strong vaccine sales with BioNTech, but also solid demand for its key Branded Pharmaceuticals products within its vitamins, minerals and enzymes segment as well as for its Allergopharma division. ","Global demand for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines remains strong, also beyond 2021 We believe that consensus estimates for Dermapharm’s vaccine business are still too conservative. Following recent bullish statements made by Pfizer and BioNTech regarding future demand and expected production volumes beyond 2021, we increase our estimates for Dermapharm’s vaccine business. Pfizer recently raised its FY 2021 Comirnaty sales guidance to $36bn (up from $33.5bn previously) driven by more contracts signed during summer. Pfizer now expects 3bn doses to be manufactured in FY 2021 (2.3bn of those to be delivered and booked as sales in FY 2021). For 2022 Pfizer expects 4bn doses to be manufactured. Based on contracts signed until mid-Oct 2021, Pfizer expects Comirnaty sales in FY 2022 of $29bn, which is below its FY 2021 sales guidance but based only on contracts signed until mid-Oct 2021, i.e. anumber which will be updated once additional contracts are signed. Furthermore, Pfizer expects ""significant Comirnaty sales beyond 2022E"". Not surprisingly, a few days later, BioNTech echoed Pfizer’s bullish comments around its Q3 reporting on 9 Nov. We now assume vaccine sales of €250m/€220m in 2022E/23E in our Dermapharm model (up from €181m in 2022E/23E each) with a 50% EBITDA margin. However, we keep our assumption of zero vaccine sales from 2025E onwards unchanged, which may turn out conservative. For the group, this translates into a 9%/4% higher adj. EBITDA estimate in FY 2022E/23E. Strong 9M 2021 earnings expected, top line continues to suffer from weak parallel import business in Germany We expect Dermapharm to report 17.6% yoy group revenue growth after 9m with a strongly over-proportional 60.8% yoy growth for adj. EBITDA and 104.6% yoy growth for EPS. We expect strong yoy growth for Dermapharm’s largest and most profitable division Branded Pharmaceuticals (+35% yoy for revenues, +61% yoy for adj. EBITDA) while we expect headwinds for the parallel import (PI) business to persist (-7.6% yoy for revenues, -67% yoy for adj. EBITDA). However, while PI contributes c. 25% to group revenues, it contributes only c.1% to group EBITDA. We see a reasonable chance for a FY 2021 guidance increase on adj. EBITDA-level (we assume +55% yoy versus current guidance of 45% to 50% yoy growth) while our FY revenue growth estimate of +22.3% yoy is slightly below company guidance of 24% to 26% yoy growth, primarily due to the weaker-than-expected but far lower-margin PI business.",Marcus Wieprecht,Marcus Wieprecht,105,93,Buy,,EUR,3.31,,4.06,,1.62,2.09,,,,,M,STIFEL_Brighter outlook_CoNote_Nov 12 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Brighter outlook_CoNote_Nov 12 2021 01-00AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=54f2044e-8d29-4e52-9d6b-4120efa3f3c5&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
PHN IM,PHN,Nov 09 2021 01:00AM,PharmaNutra,SPONSORED RESEARCH Pharmaceuticals,Bullish outlook implies upside risk to consensus ,"PharmaNutra delivered a solid set of Q3 results, with a strong sequential salesacceleration in line with expectations and better than forecast profitability, driven by the postponement of some costs to Q4. During the conference call, management flagged a robust exit rate to quarter and provided a bullish outlook for FY-21, implying a low- to mid single-digit upside revision to consensus sales estimates. Looking ahead, the latest news flow, namely the entry into new countries both in Europe and the Far East, on top of the grant of Cetilar patents in India and China, provides further appeal to the equity story and raises visibility on the mid-term forecasts. This is without mentioning the M&A opportunity or some potential new partnership projects in Mainland. ","Q3-21 sales in line, profitability above expectations: Q3 sales accelerated +47% YoY (vs +17% in Q2 and +4% in Q1) to €17m, in line with our and consensus estimates, supported by already anticipated strong volumes. The acceleration was driven by the resumption of physical detailing activities in Italy and different timing of orders from partners abroad. By product, almost all lines showed strong double-digit growth, with all-important SidearAL accelerating sequentially (+52% in Q3 vs +9% in H1), Cetilar (+18%), Apportal (+98%), UltraMag (+41%), Others (+10%). Adj. EBITDA of €5.5m came in significantly above expectations (SFe and consensus: ~€3.3m), due to the postponement of some service costs from Q3 to Q4, driving Net Profit to €3.8m and Net Cash to €20.9m. Bullish outlook: The exit rate to Q3 is promising and management is now confident to reach revenues of close to €70m in FY-21, exceeding the current consensus of €66m. We understood that management will continue to progressively invest in marketing & advertising investments, accelerating the run-rate in FY-22, while only a part of the lower- costs that occurred in Q3 will shift to Q4, implying some upside to current consensus estimates of ~27% Adj. EBITDA Margin for FY-21. For FY-22, sales are expected to continue growing at a double-digit rate, both in Italy and international markets, thanks to the start-up in the new markets where distribution agreements were recently signed, the enlargement of product portfolio with existing partners, and finalisation of new distribution agreements for SiderAL. Hints from the conference call: we highlight 1. PharmaNutra is currently evaluating to file for the new patent box regime, allowing them to claim a super tax deduction equal to 90% of R&D costs, which is not yet currently factored into consensus; 2. Management is currently evaluating several M&A options in key countries, namely the US and China. Furthermore, a strategic partnership or agreement for the development of cross-border digital e-commerce platforms in the Chinese market for its nutraceuticals products may not be ruled out in the near future. This move will temporarily overcome a long process for product registration issues, allowing a quicker timing to sales. Investment thesis: PharmaNutra's competitive advantage stems from its proprietary raw materials employed in its products, as well as its patented technologies which serve as a valuable barrier to entry from the competition. Thanks to multiple organic growth opportunities, the company is well-placed in a steadily growing industry. Furthermore, its strong balance sheet leaves room for M&A, providing yet another catalyst not factored into our valuation model. Our valuation is based on pure organic growth assumptions and excludes M&A upside from its €60-80m of firepower, assuming a ND/EBITDA ratio of between 2.0x and 3.0x at the end of FY-21.",Daniele Alibrandi,Daniele Alibrandi,88,,Buy,,EUR,1.25,,1.44,,0.63,0.72,,,,,M,STIFEL_Bullish outlook_FlashCoNote_Nov 09 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Bullish outlook_FlashCoNote_Nov 09 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=349c70a8-9412-4f6a-9604-591d606b90fb&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
ERF FP,ERF,Dec 15 2021 12:56AM,Eurofins,Business Services,Buy ahead of earnings revisions ,"We upgrade our rating from Hold to Buy as we see a tactical entry point intothe structural growth story. We believe consensus underestimates the current top-line tailwinds both in the Core Business and in COVID-19 testing. We thus expect significant earnings revisions, which should drive the share price up, in our view. e In this note, we notably review our COVID-19 testing scenario. In addition, we perform an in-depth analysis of the COVID-19 testing profitability. We conclude that margins should be more resilient than expected by consensus. e We raise our 2021-23E adj. EPS sequence by +11%/+27%/+8%. Thus, we raise our PT from €105 to €130 (c.25% upside). ","Core organic growth outperformance set to continue, supporting valuation. We raise our 2022E core organic growth from 5% (i.e. guidance level) to 7%. We expect the high comparison base (14% as of 9M-21) to be offset by the continued strong demand in the Biopharma end-market. The group benefits from rising client R&D spending and outsourcing. In addition, we expect the group to benefit from the current inflationary environment to raise prices by 3-6% (vs 1-3% usually) as it benefits from a leading market positioning in a currently under-supplied industry. We believe that if ERF beats its 5% core organic growth target again next year, it should support the underlying growth story and valuation. COVID-19 testing revenue should remain material in 2022E, and we expect consensus estimates to double. Consensus has not yet taken into account the recent rebound in COVID-19 testing and the omicron variant. Our previous estimates assumed sharp and steady decline from Q3-21 peak levels, yet we were already 50% above consensus on 2022E COVID-19 testing revenue. We now expect volumes to peak in Q1-22 (above Q3-21 delta variant levels), followed by a rapid decline. Thus, we lift our COVID-19 testing sales of 2021/22/23E by +6%/+44%/+24%, and we stand +14%/ +123%/+258% above consensus. This could still prove conservative as the risk of new variants arising should require continued testing and monitoring. We analyse the COVID-19 testing margin drivers. We conclude that it is indeed dilutive at the gross margin level, but it benefits from a very strong operating leverage at the EBITDA level. The COVID-19 testing gross margin has remained stable despite PCR price cuts, notably due to decreasing reagent prices. Although we expect the COVID-19 margin to soften as revenue phases out, it should remain accretive at the group level. In addition, we believe Q3-21 comments from management have been misunderstood by the market, and COVID-19 remains largely accretive (more detail within). Overall, we forecast c.60%/50%/30% COVID-19 testing EBITDA margins in 2021/22/23E. We upgrade to Buy (from Hold) and raise our PT to €130 (from €105). Our valuation is based on a conservative 10% premium (vs >20% historical) to peers' EV/EBIT and P/ adj. 2022E multiples. We discount back our valuation by 12 months. It implies 30x/35x P/E adj. 2022/23E and 21x/25x EV/EBIT adj. (ex IFRS 16, incl. hybrid). Catalyst: we expect significant consensus earnings revisions to drive the share price over the coming months (FY results due 22 February 2022). We raise our group 2021/22/23E revenue sequence by 1%/6%/3%, accounting for higher COVID-19 testing estimates, and +2% core organic growth in 2022E.

Thus, we upgrade our rating from Hold to Buy, and raise our DCF-based PT from €38 to €46, implying more than 16% upside. Assuming a re-rating to a 5% dividend yield, we could see up to 27% upside. ","We expect Nexity to beat its FY-21 guidance, and see upside to consensus. The group reiterated its guidance of €4.4bn revenue pro forma of divestments (Aegide- Domitys and Century 21); which implies €1.3bn revenue in Q4-21 (down -33% y/y). Nexity highlighted that the expected decline is due to (1) the divestment of Domitys and Century 21, and (2) the high comp. base in Commercial Development. However, adjusting for these elements, we would expect NXI to generate €1.5bn in Q4, 16% above the €1.3bn implied guidance. We therefore assume that Nexity has remained quite conservative, and we expect a beat on Q4 sales. In addition, we forecast €380m current EBIT in 2021, c.5% above guidance and consensus. Building permit inflection point: back to pre-COVID levels and accelerating. The number of building permits granted rose sharply in September: +20% q/q (SAR), +19% y/ y, and +25% vs. Sep-19. Thus, the R12M number of building permits granted in France came back to its 2019 level. Nexity outperformed the market with its Sep-21 R12M standing 8% above 2019 level. This, in our view, reflects the superiority of Nexity's model, as the group offers a wider portfolio of brands, products, and services. Nexity was also very proactive by sharply increasing the number of filings for new building permits. The group is currently investing in its land bank as it anticipates a recovery over the mid-term. Overall, we believe this inflection point should be a catalyst for investors to regain interest in the homebuilding sector and its attractive prospects. In addition, we see Nexity as very well positioned to outperform the market. An attractive valuation and entry point: upgrade to Buy from Hold. We raise our DCF-based valuation from €38 to €46, implying 16% upside. We could see up to 27% upside (€50 per share) based on a 5% 2021 dividend yield valuation (DPS payable 2022). NXI currently trades on 5.6% consensus 2021 dividend yield, and 6.3% based on our €2.50 DPS estimate. The next major catalyst is the publication of the 2021 results, where we expect a beat on guidance, and an encouraging 2022 guidance (thanks to the uptick building permits and higher land bank). In the meantime, we expect the monthly publication of market data on building permits should support investor sentiment and help drive a re-rating. Better profile post portfolio reshuffling, and continued successful strategy In 2021, Nexity completed the strategic review of its portfolio, resulting in the divestment of Aegide-Domitys, and Century 21. The group reduced leverage, raised profitability, and refocused on core activities. The short-term strategic focus is to build a solid land bank (up to €300m envelope) to capture the market recovery. Beyond, the group intends to continue building its integrated platform of real estate development and services. The company is expected to provide an update on its strategic roadmap in H1-22, which could include mid- term financial targets and act as a positive catalyst.",Nicolas Tabor,Nicolas Tabor,46,38,Buy , Hold ,EUR,2.74,,3.24,,2.5,2.7,,,,,M,STIFEL_Buy on_CoNote_Nov 01 2021 02-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Buy on_CoNote_Nov 01 2021 02-00AM,COMPANY REPORT,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=7fe50165-e511-450f-8b91-6ba3418bedc4&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
VOW3 GY,VOW3,Nov 25 2021 01:27AM,Volkswagen AG,Automotive,CEO Diess not involved in budget planning? ,"After the supervisory board meeting on Tuesday, it remains unclear whether CEODiess remains on board. Today, Handelsblatt reports that Diess is not involved in the 5-year planning round that decides over a c. EUR150bn budget. The article says that discussions with the Works Council were led by the divisional heads of Audi, VW brand, etc as well as by Porsche CEO Blume (who is also in charge of production at VW Group) and Gunnar Kilian, head of HR. If the article is correct, Diess' position seems further weakened and there seems to be no good outcome option from the current power struggle: Either continue with a weakened CEO or replace the person who is the architect of the EV and software strategy. ","Job remains at risk: According to Handelsblatt, people close to Diess stated that the CEO does not need to be involved in the operating business when things are running smoothly, but that his focus was on technology-related topics. However, that seems bit far-fetched: firstly, things are not generally running smoothly at the moment; secondly, the decision about production planning and investments for the next five years should be core CEO tasks. Isolating Diess from this rather shows that his job remains at risk for the time being. After Diess' contract was extended to 2025 in July, we did expect tougher negotiations with unions. However, not to the point where the supervisory board seem prepared to cancel a contract that was signed just four months ago. Sentiment at a trough: VW share price had a brilliant Q1 (+62%) - the conflict between Diess and Osterloh was resolved and VW was the EV play among European OEMs. After a slow start of BEVs in China, the Supreme Court decision about legal claims by US States and problems with chip shortages, sentiment deteriorated. The conflict between unions and management adds to that. Over the past six months, VW underperformed Daimler by a stunning 37%-points. However, as BEV sales in China are gaining some momentum, chip shortages probably peaked in Q3 and the conflict between Diess and unions will be resolved in one way or the other in a few weeks, we would not reverse our positive rating at this point - sentiment is more likely to improve from here, in our view.",Daniel Schwarz,"Daniel Schwarz;Pierre-Yves Quémeéner;Alexander Wahl, CFA",308,,Buy,,EUR,29.9,,34.7,,8.36,10.4,,,,,M,STIFEL_CEO Diess_FlashCoNote_Nov 25 2021 01-27AM.pdf,STIFEL_CEO Diess_FlashCoNote_Nov 25 2021 01-27AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=117b66e6-153b-47a4-81ac-b1360972d2f3&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
DSV DC,DSV,Dec 17 2021 02:40AM,DSV A/S,Transportation,"CEO group call feedback: 'Play it again, Jens' ","We hosted a global group call with CEO Jens Andersen that touched uponcurrent trading conditions (still tight), the outlook for FY22 (current conditions will prevail) and what a post-pandemic world might look for freight (significantly higher freight rates and yields compared to pre-pandemic conditions). Thus, it is higher for longer again. Naturally, DB Schenker came up, too and unsurprisingly Mr Andersen didn't provide specifics but confirmed that DSV is ready to act whenever necessary despite the ongoing Agility GIL (AGIL) integration. ","No progress in unclogging supply chains in 4Q21: According to Mr Andersen, there was little progress in unclogging supply chains in 4Q21 despite additional efforts from US ports to improve the flow of cargo through the system. In addition, bottlenecks and congestion don't only affect ocean freight markets, but airports are clogged, too which supports air freight rates. We believe his remarks support our view that 4Q21 results ex-Agility GIL (AGIL) will be at least as good as 3Q21 (link). “No progress"" might also be true for the entirety of FY22 While Mr Andersen didn't provide an official guidance yet, he said that he expects current market conditions to continue for the entirety of FY22. We believe this outlook is more bullish than current market expectations, who largely hold the view that freight markets will start to ease once Chinese New Year arrives in February 2022 and will normalize in earnest at some point in 2H22. According to Mr Andersen, the major bottlenecks are ports, and as it usually takes a couple of years for capacity expansion to be realized he doesn't believe in major progress any time soon given that US demand shows no signs of abating. Freight rates and yields will be higher once freight market normalize According to Mr Andersen, freight rates and yields won't return to pre-pandemic levels. He believes yields (gross profit per unit) will drop by -10% in the Air division and -20% in the Ocean division when measured from 3Q21 levels. We currently model -17% in Air and -27% in Ocean by FY25 and believe that our estimates are more optimistic than consensus estimates. While reliable FY25 EBIT consensus estimates are hard to come by, Reuters consensus data suggests there is ~25% upside risk to FY25 EBIT consensus estimates. Mr Andersen's outlook implies that yields are ~20% stronger post-normalisation compared to the pre-pandemic/pre-Panalpina period. We believe the mechanics behind the increase in yields are in line with our most recent sector update, i.e. structurally higher freight rates, higher supply chain complexity, more service opportunities (link). AGIL integration ahead of initial plan and budget Mr Andersen confirmed the recently updated FY23 DKK3bn EBIT contribution outlook for AGIL as the integration is running smoothly. Compared to the Panalpina acquisition, they see barely any churn in customers or the need for deliberately cutting unprofitable volumes. On-shoring/near-shoring (O/N) not a thing, but out-sourcing might be In line with our recent sector note (link), Mr Andersen confirmed that DSV has witnessed little O/N activities. Clients are rather bulking up on inventory management, which supports Contract Logistics, and DSV has instead won some business that traditionally went to carriers directly (which implies that the business was managed by in-house logistics divisions before).",Marc Zeck,"Marc Zeck, CFA;Johannes Braun, CFA, CIIA",1740,,Buy,,DKK,50,,53.3,,7.41,8,,,,,M,STIFEL_CEO group_FlashCoNote_Dec 17 2021 02-40AM.pdf,STIFEL_CEO group_FlashCoNote_Dec 17 2021 02-40AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=346790cc-b138-467e-8a0e-fbf5f57303ec&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
CON GY,CON,Nov 18 2021 01:00AM,Continental AG,Automotive Supplier,CFO leaves after shortcomings in investigations were uncovered ,CON has terminated the contract with CFO Schaefer with immediate effect after,"shortcomings in the investigation of illegal defeat devices by Continental were uncovered. While the investigations were already known, we believe insufficient cooperation in the investigation could be interpreted by investors as an indication of actual misconduct and raise concerns on potential financial liabilities arising from this. So far, the potential magnitude of such claims has not been quantified but we expect the shares to be under pressure today. Yesterday evening, CON sent out an ad-hoc stating that the supervisory board has decided to terminate the contract with CFO Wolfgang Schaefer with immediate effect. It has further declared that this step is directly linked to ongoing and known investigations by the public prosecutor's office in regard to illegal defeat devices in diesel engines. As we understand it, these actions are completely unrelated to current operations but the allegation is that CFO Schaefer, in his capacity as the person responsible for compliance, did not cooperate sufficiently in the investigation. The investigation itself relates to engine control units produced by Continental's former Powertrain division (Vitesco) and used in Volkswagen (VW) diesel engines. CON has spun-off its powertrain division - Vitesco - in September this year and ""Vitesco Technologies Group AG and Vitesco Technologies GmbH must indemnify Continental AG and other companies of the Continental Group under the terms and conditions defined therein from and against expenses and liabilities attributable to the businesses transferred to the Vitesco Technologies Group as part of the Carve- out."" (Vitesco prospectus, p.18). Having spoken to the company, we understand it is unclear whether this would only apply to potential claims brought up by third parties such as customers or end users of cars equipped with defeat devices or also to fines potentially imposed by regulators, particularly since the violations under question would have been committed when Vitesco was still part and under the supervision of Continental. e@ The magnitude of any potential claims either against Vitesco or Continental has so far not been quantified and Vitesco has not regognized provisions or liabilities for future costs related to the proceedings. Volkswagen itself has recognized claims related to illegal defeat devices of slightly more than €30bn, of which only a fraction relates to fines imposed by the regulator. Considering the relative size of the two (VW had industrial revenues of c€185bn in 2020E vs c€8bn for Vitesco), we would expect any fine imposed on Vitesco to be a small fraction of this amount.",Alexander Wahl,"Alexander Wahl, CFA;Daniel Schwarz;Pierre-Yves Quémener",119,,Buy,,EUR,6.07,,8.79,,1.4,2.65,,,,,M,STIFEL_CFO leaves_FlashCoNote_Nov 18 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_CFO leaves_FlashCoNote_Nov 18 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=7dcef0f8-a18d-401e-95c4-b65ec753106a&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
KGX GY,KGX,Oct 28 2021 11:43AM,KION,Industrials,"Changing the game, price target EUR 120 (115) ","KION is transforming itself into a warehouse automation provider that also sells forklifttrucks. We consider this an exciting development, as warehouse automation is a teen- growth, teen-margin and highly cash-accretive business (negative NWC). e We discuss plausible valuation multiples, anticipate focus points ahead of next week's investor day and reveal our 2022 forklift truck end-market outlook. e KION remains a top pick for 2021, preferred over Jungheinrich (JUN3 GY, €43.26, Hold): our new price target of EUR 120 (from EUR 115) implies c.30-35% potential upside and a FY-23 EV/EBIT of 12.9x (five-year trailing average 13.3x); we strongly reiterate our Buy rating. ","Accelerated secular trend and unique exposure explain remarkable order growth KION bought its warehouse automation business with the acquisition of Dematic in 2016 at an enterprise value (EV) of c. EUR 2.85bn and estimated sales of c.EUR 1.7bn (EV/ EBIT pre-/post cost synergies 18.1x/16.4x). KION has developed the business since, helped by the secular trend towards warehouse automation. The trend has enabled teen growth in this end-market, further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. As the largest and most global provider, due to its vertical exposure KION has benefited disproportionately strongly from a boom in e-commerce, general merchandise and grocery. As a result, KION recorded remarkable order growth of c.30% in its SCS segment in 2020 and c.25% in 9M-21. Comparing the two forklift names, we highlight this strength is unique to KION. Warehouse automation key absolute EBIT driver but not reflected in valuations Trailing order momentum, we estimate SCS sales doubling from c.EUR 2.4bn in FY-19 to c.4.8bn in FY-23. Enabled by scale economies, we expect SCS EBIT adjusted margins to expand, from FY-19's c.9.5% to 13.0% in FY-23 (9M-21 c.12%) yielding EBIT of c. EUR 620m (c.45% of total versus 25% in FY-19). Applying KION’s five-year EV/EBIT trailing average of c.13.3x yields an EV of c.EUR 8.25bn. This compares with KION’s trading EV of c.EUR 14.6bn (>50%). This said, KION’s historical machine building multiple might prove conservative for a teen-growth, teen-margin and highly cash-accretive business (negative NWC). Applying a sector multiple of c.14.0x or a pre-crisis automation multiple of c.16.0x would yield an EV of EUR 8.7bn or EUR 10bn (incremental EUR 3.5 or EUR 13 per share, i.e., >50% potential upside). SCS future development next week; consensus upside pressure remains intact At the investor day, KION will outline future segment development. We hope KION will introduce a SCS mid-term target, EUR 5bn in sales and 12-14% margin (Stifel SCS FY-23 sales EUR 4.75bn, margin 13%, EBIT c.20% above consensus). Elsewhere, we estimate the European forklift truck end-market could grow c.50% in 2021 followed by a c.5% contraction in 2022. This said, note that KION’s ITS segment (forklift trucks) book- to-bill ratio has seen unprecedented expansion that will likely reverse (1.15x vs c.1.03x historical average). This means while orders may stagnate in FY-22, we still expect ITS segment sales to catch up and grow by 5%. Our raised FY 21-23 group EBIT numbers still land above 2021 guidance and are c.7% ahead of consensus, on average. KION remains top idea, fair value implies c.30-35% upside, Buy strongly reiterated KION trades on a FY-23 EV/EBIT of c.10.1x versus the pre-COVID-19 five-year trailing average of c.13.3x. To capture KION’s structurally higher sales and FY 21-23 rebound in profitability, we value the shares using a DCF method that now yields a new price target of EUR 120 (from EUR 115). This implies c.30-35% potential upside and a FY-23 EV/ EBIT of c.12.9x, i.e., below even the five-year trailing average. We continue to expect strong rebound in large industrial trucks and sustainably higher sales in warehouse automation to support the shares.

WCH GY,WCH,Dec 20 2021 01:02AM,Wacker Chemie AG,Chemicals,Chemicals indicate ongoing strong trends ,"Polysilicon prices have started to normalise, hurting sentiment towards thestock, which might continue short term. This is also true for rising natural gas and electricity costs in Germany. e Polysilicon strategy will focus 100% on high-end grades, which are semi and n- type mono solar grades, translating to higher resilience. e The Chemicals business is showing good momentum and pricing power. We forecast +16% EBITDA growth for these segments in 2022. e Biosolution is showing positive news flow and capital light expansion of the Biotech technology platform. e With new targets and the goal of carbon-neutral Si-metal supply, ESG becomes a positive driver. ","Polysilicon margins normalise as new capacities hit the market faster than expected: We have not changed our Q4-21 forecast of €200m EBITDA (aligned with guidance). Given the q/q ASP increase, the forecast looks conservative. We reduce our Polysilicon earnings outlook by 10% for 2022, but are still expecting c-€400m EBITDA, in line with consensus. We stick to our view of normalised EBITDA of €150-250m and continue to value the segment at book value. Forecasts increased for Silicones in 2022: Continued strong demand for specialties and announced price increases of +30% should speak for good earnings momentum in 2022. In Q4-21, the accumulated impact of temporary shutdowns at all three siloxane plants might be €50m. The lack of this effect is already a c.+10% y/y EBITDA increase in 2022. Ongoing high single-digit growth in specialties (not the least driven by high demand in EVs) with respective product mix effects should help to lift Silicones EBITDA to c.€600m in 2022. Biosolutions should support the investment case with positive news flow: Most important is the progress towards the 2030 target of €1bn sales with a >25% margin. In 2021, Wacker was able to expand the technology toolbox in a capital-efficient way with the CordenPharma (Italy) cooperation in Lipid Nano Particles (LNP) and the acquisition of Genopis adding pDNA. We expect more of this news in 2022, which should support the investment case. New ambitious ESG targets: Wacker strives to reduce CO2 Scope 1+2 emissions by 50% from 2020-30 and to achieve net zero by 2045. The company even has an upstream Scope 3 target of -25% by 2030. To achieve carbon-neutral Si-metal supply and increase green energy purchase are the cornerstones of this target. By 2030, 100% of Wacker's products should be neutral or positive on the environment. Progress in all these directions puts Wacker at the top end in the environmental ranking and sustainability should drive the investment case.

DAE SW,DAE,Dec 15 2021 01:22AM,Daetwyler,Industrials,China acquisition supports long-term growth — PT up to CHF 430 ,Attractive acquisition in Chinae Daetwyler to build up a China hub — considerable potential e@ Outlook for the next years very bright e Increase in estimates and new PT of CHF 430 (from CHF 385) ,"Finally — Daetwyler finds an attractive acquisition in China Earlier than we had expected, Daetwyler announced the take over of the Chinese healthcare packaging company Yantai Xinhui Packaging. The company has a modern factory (2017), complementary products and clients. Yantai does around CHF 15m revenues p.a. at healthy (yet below average HC) margins. We estimate the price paid to have been between CHF 40 and 60m. China hub offers considerable potential for Daetwyler The step into China has always been part of our bull case scenario for Daetwyler. It has also been a topic for quite some years but Daetwyler was unable to find the right targets. With Yantai, Daetwyler has acquired a modern production facility with a lot of spare space to ramp-up capacity quickly. The current products (more for medical, less for pharma) are complementary and Daetwyler will build up production for higher value parts for the pharma industry in China. The market is growing by >10% p.a. We expect that the factory has the same revenue potential in the mid-term like the other factories (high double to low triple digit revenues). Additionally, there is the opportunity to purchase land right next to the existing factory, so capacity can be easily expanded. In our view, this acquisition is a game changer for Daetwyler in the mid- to long-term as the company produces now in all major end-markets (Europe, US, India and China) and is only one of three global operators in this market. Outlook is very bright for longer — even beyond 2024 In our view, Daetwyler's business prospects remain very bright for longer. The healthcare business is benefiting from extraordinary strong demand, from (limited) Covid vaccine effects and from the move towards higher value products (FirstLine). Visibility and pricing are very good for Daetwyler and we see growth at the upper end of guidance for the next two to three years (guidance excludes Covid vaccines). The coffee business offers additional stable growth at high margins while the remaining industrial business should recover in 2022 and 2023 on growth and margins. Daetwyler's mid-term guidance up to 2024 is attractive for investors, but our research indicates that the margin boost from more FirstLine (high value) products will kick-in after 2024, therefore we see even more potential in the longer term. Increase of estimates and new PT of CHF 430 We increase our estimates for 2022 and 2023 only slightly and mainly due to the acquisition in China (CHF 15m revenues in 2022, CHF 20m 2023). We leave our margin assumptions unchanged but increase our capex slightly for the next two to three years. However, we see faster healthcare growth in the years beyond 2023 due to acquisition in China (HCS revenue CAGR of 12.8% 2020-26 from 11.8%). With our unchanged valuation approach (50% DCF/50% SOTP) we arrive at a PT of CHF 430 and remain buyers. Daetwyler offers an attractive combination of strong growth with high visibility plus cyclical upside in 2022. This makes it a very interesting case, in our view.",Michael Inauen,Michael Inauen,430,385,Buy,,CHF,7.66,,9.1,,3,3,,,,,M,STIFEL_China acquisition_CoNote_Dec 15 2021 01-22AM.pdf,STIFEL_China acquisition_CoNote_Dec 15 2021 01-22AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=f5c201ea-b14f-48ec-94a5-775a470fd9d6&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
PUM GY,PUM,Oct 28 2021 01:00AM,Puma SE,Consumer Goods,China the only missing part. PT to €118 (vs. €114) , Superior execution drove another beat in 3Q21. New FY21 guidance brought littlehelp as 4Q21 implications are highly undemanding. e Earnings call was much more positive on Vietnam than on China that remains the missing part and strongest sector catalyst. e We tweak our earnings estimates and raise our target price (DCF model) to €118 from €114. Details page 6. ,"3Q21: another beat underscoring superior execution With 20% organic sales growth in 3Q21 (vs. SFe and consensus: +15%e), the company posted a 2Y-stack growth of 36% at CER over 3Q19, showing no deceleration from the similar 2Y-stack growth recorded in 2Q19. By region, contrast remained significant in 3Q21 between 2Y-stack recorded in the Americas (+58%), EMEA (+44%) and Asia-Pacific (flat). Despite cost inflation (raw materials and sea/ground transportation), inefficiencies (port congestion and air freight usage), negative regional (Asia underperforming Americas) and channel mix (DTC underperforming wholesale, +13% vs. +23%), the company managed to grow GM% 40bp (47.4% vs. 47.0%) and stabilize EBIT% YOY at 12.0%. Strong underlying demand (strong fixed cost absorption) and low promotional intensity were the two main drivers. China: strongest negative / main sector catalyst Uncertainty prevails in China where western brands have not yet recovered from the BCI related brand-bashing that took place end-March. Puma was down 16% in China in 3Q21 with its 2Y-stack strongly deteriorating sequentially: +19% in 1Q21, +10% in 2Q21 and -14% in 3Q21. A few months ago, one would have expected China to post stronger 3Q21 than 2Q21. NKE (covered by Stifel colleague Jim Duffy) management expected progressive sales recovery throughout its FY22 (fiscal year ending May-22) when reporting 1Q22 (end-August) results late September. In Puma's earnings call, China was the main source of uncertainty, in our opinion, even if important promotional 11/11 event could eventually feed hopes. Management was, indeed, a little less negative about very recent trends heading into this event, particularly on Ecom traffic. However, visibility remains low overall. All international leaders' LT business plans (NKE, ADS, PUM) assume a return to consistent +DD sales growth, driving top line growth and regional mix/margin expansion. Any evidence of a market recovery in China would be the strongest catalyst for the shares and sector, in our view. Vietnam disruptions: reassuring dynamics News flow from Vietnam continues to improve and management is hoping for a return to full capacity by end-November, supported by employee vaccination progress. With 60% of employees having received a second injection, capacity use already reaches 60% in footwear and 70% in apparel. Management expects both vaccination and capacity rates to improve by 10pp per week until end-November. Beyond 4Q21, potential product shortage from Vietnam disruption would be contained to 1Q22 only. Vietnam predominantly supplies North America with value-added footwear. Adidas X-Read: over-propertional exposure to China With ~25% of sales in China (vs. ~15% for Puma), Adidas (Buy,€279.15) is even more hit by China uncertainties. We expect 2Y-stack sales growth of -17% in 3Q21 (10 Nov) after -15% in 2Q21 and +7% in 1Q21. Conversely, positive comments from Puma on Vietnam are also encouraging for ADS. In our latest calls with the company, ADS was expecting return to normal at some point in 4Q21, potentially limiting the 2022 impact to 1Q22.",Cedric Lecasble,Cedric Lecasble,118,114,Buy,,EUR,1.94,,2.67,,0.59,0.81,,,,,M,STIFEL_China the_CoNote_Oct 28 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_China the_CoNote_Oct 28 2021 01-00AM,EARNINGS UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=64ec908d-3c86-4cd8-987f-056f05191a27&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

This is due to both a structural change in terms of greater consideration for issues such as the environmental impact of a development and COVID related backlogs of planning approvals. Instone's revenue outlook chart in the new company presentation available on its website implies a greater step up of revenues to the €1.6bn target in FY25 and FY26 than our or consensus' more linear progression assumes. We believe this may be in part a reflection of caution on behalf of the company borne out of the greater uncertainty around approval schedules for the current development portfolio. Margin targets confirmed Management reiterated its expectation of a gross margin of ~25% in the medium term. In the short term, certain higher margin developments will see a gross margin above this level with guidance for 26% in FY22 (Stifel: 26%) indicated at the 9M21 presentation. Over the longer term, this is expected to be diluted by the lower margin (~20%) Valuehome product, also reflected in our estimates for FY23-26E. The CFO confirmed that Instone's longer term EBIT margin guidance of 16-18% stands, with the Valuehome product EBIT margin in line with the traditional product despite its lower gross profit margin. We assume an EBIT margin of 16.7% in FY22E rising to 17.2% in FY23E, 17.5% in FY24E and 17.8% in FY25E. Downward pressure on consensus Having already cut our estimates following the 9M21 results, we leave our forecasts unchanged. However, consensus needs to come down by ~20% for FY22-24E in our view to reflect the updated medium term targets. We see the investment case as delayed but intact and reiterate our Buy rating and target price of €28.0.",Tom Carstairs,Tom Carstairs;René Locher,28,,Buy,,EUR,1.99,,2,,0.6,0.65,,,,,M,STIFEL_Clarity on_CoNote_Dec 01 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Clarity on_CoNote_Dec 01 2021 01-00AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=8b524f7f-05bd-413c-ab2d-d1cccf9e9303&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
CA FP,CA,Nov 10 2021 01:00AM,Carrefour,Retail,Clear digital journey ,"Carrefour held its meeting yesterday focusing on its new digital ambition oftripling its GMV from c€3.3bn in 2021 to €10bn in 2026 while delivering €600m incremental EBIT (only one-third of which is likely driven by pure ECom). We like Carrefour's dual approach in an open ecosystem: 1) Intensify global partnerships with tech giants (Google, Uber, Facebook); 2) Onboard promising start-ups (such as Cajoo in express delivery). Management is committed to reversing a late start into a decisive competitive advantage while updating investors more regularly on ","progress. Main commercial targets are the following: Digital market share above brick-and-mortar market share and above 20% in both France and Spain. We think this is an ambitious target: 1) In France, Carrefour has had a late start and let its largest competitor and now market leader, Leclerc, lead the game by a huge magnitude in click & collect. Management believes Carrefour owned a c/% digital market share back in 2017 (when CEO Mr. Bompard came on board) compared with its physical market share of ~20%. Today, management estimates its digital share at c15% (compared with a B&M share of slightly below 20% according to Kantar); 2) In Spain, Carrefour's brick & mortar competitive edge is lower in a market dominated by family owned and private company Mercadona. Carrefour owns c8-9% (Nielsen) of the Spanish brick-and-mortar food retail market and its ambition is to own more than twice its physical market share in digital. GMV 2026 target: €10bn vs. c€3.3bn in 2021 with Ecom revenues accounting for more than 10% of consolidated sales. Omnichannel. Like in almost all consumer categories, an omnichannel customer spends more overall (higher purchasing frequency more than offsetting smaller average basket) than a purely brick-and-mortar customer. Greater convenience/flexibility is the main driver for higher overall spending. Carrefour estimates a traditional customer turning omnichannel spends 22% more (splitting +15% frequency/+7% basket) after one year and 27% more after years. 2026 target is to reach 30% of omnichannel customers. Most interesting financial takeaways are the following: Scaling operations. No current profitability number was provided. Management nevertheless revealed an 11pp improvement in Ecom margin over the last two years (2021 vs. 2019). From here, we expect incremental volume will contribute to further absorb fixed costs and help global Ecom profitability further improve. Growing the business is accretive to profitability. Management targets €600m incremental digital EBIT in 2026 vs. 2021. Ecom as such drives only one-third of the total (€200m) but is instrumental in leveraging the huge customer base/database to deliver €200m incremental EBIT in financial services and the remaining €200m in monetizing data (with brand suppliers, essentially). Positive impact on FCF as of 2023. Carrefour management has committed to sustainably deliver annual FCF > €1bn (2021 FCF guidance comfortably above €1bn). Resources to reach ambition: Stepped-up digital investments: from €400m annually (over the last four years) to €600m over the next five years, or ~35% of total capex of c€1.7bn. Intensified partnerships: 1) With tech giants: Google partnership (cloud) has been reconducted, an exclusive partnership with Uber Eats has been launched and Carrefour and Facebook have signed for Meta; 2) With promising start- ups such as Cajoo for Express delivery (<15 minutes).",Cedric Lecasble,Cedric Lecasble,20,,Buy,,EUR,1.39,,1.56,,0.53,0.6,,,,,M,STIFEL_Clear digital_FlashCoNote_Nov 10 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Clear digital_FlashCoNote_Nov 10 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=51baef7d-7ffc-4470-9079-92f33324520c&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
DAE SW,DAE,Dec 07 2021 01:52AM,Daetwyler,Industrials,Closing the healthcare gap in China ,"Today Daetwyler announced the acquisition of the Chinese company Yantai XinhuiPackaging, therefore closing the healthcare gap in China. With this acquisition, Daetwyler has production capabilities in all relevant markets (USA, China, Europe, India) and closes a strategic gap. Details of the acquisition were not disclosed but Yantai Xinhui Packaging was founded in 2003 and has invested in a new production facility in 2017. The company has automated production for elastomer components for the healthcare market and has its own R&D team. Yantai is a family company with around 170 employees and around CHF 15m revenues per year. The acquisition is expected to close in Q1 2022, financials details have yet to be provided. We expect Daetwlyer paid a price in the mid-double-digit millions. ","Conclusion: We have long awaited Daetwyler's market entry in China (as a producer). This acquisition marks a big step for the company as up until now, it had no presence as a producer in China. Daetwyler will now be able to participate directly in the healthcare growth of >10% p.a. in China. We view this acquisition as very positive. Integration risks limited with modern production: Yantai invested in a new production facility only four years ago. In our view this limits the integration risk for Daetwyler, as production standards are high and can be further optimised by the company. Yantai looks like a good fit on paper. Impact on numbers: Discussion over whether Daetwyler would enter China with greenfield factory or via acquisition has been going on for years. The acquisition has the benefit that no significant investments or ramp-up costs are needed and no sizeable pressure on margins. We expect that over time, Daetwyler will expand production in China and as the market grows fast, capacity will be used up quickly. The CHF 15m revenues will add around 4% growth to Daetwyler's HC division and could push growth over the mid-term targets once production is expanded. Several reasons to Buy — we remain positive: For us, the acquisition in China is another strong reason to buy the shares as it pushes healthcare growth even further. Additionally, the coffee business is growing strongly at high margins and Daetwyler still benefits from the Covid-19 vaccine business. Not to forget, almost 70% of revenues have high visibility and high margins. Daetwyler does also have pricing power in the majority of its business which should offer protection against inflation. We are clear buyers here.",Michael Inauen,Michael Inauen,385,,Buy,,CHF,7.66,,8.95,,3,3,,,,,M,STIFEL_Closing the_FlashCoNote_Dec 07 2021 01-52AM.pdf,STIFEL_Closing the_FlashCoNote_Dec 07 2021 01-52AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=a0cbc6ff-5ac9-4f35-bca7-56c5826bb437&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
SPSN SW,SPSN,Oct 26 2021 02:40AM,Swiss Prime Site,Real Estate,CMD 2021: We support medium-term strategy ,Swiss Prime Site hosts its Capital Markets Day 2021 today. Our key take-awaysare: 1) SPS expects strong FY21 results; 2) The pandemic does not have a negative impact on space demand as customers are focusing even more on prime locations and high flexibility of space; 3) SPS increased its 2025 targets for Swiss Prime Site Solutions. ,"SPS expects strong FY-21 results, with rental income up 2.5% yoy on a like-for-like basis (STe: flat). At the EBIT level (before revaluations) SPS expects an increase of >5% on a like-for-like basis, also due to improved cost efficiency. The vacancy rate is expected to remain stable at 4.6%- 4.8% (H1-21: 4.7%). We conclude that the outlook for FY-21 is slightly ahead of consensus expectations. e@ Medium-term goals: We conclude that SPS did not materially change its view on Real Estate. In Services, SPS is more positive on Swiss Prime Site Solutions and reduced its medium-term targets for Wincasa. In Real Estate, the company increased its medium-term portfolio size from CHF ~12bn to CHF ~12-13bn, with a vacancy rate of 4% (old: ~4%). SPS still aims to reduce its share of Retail to <20% by 2025 and increase Office and Infrastructure (new)/Logistic use. The capital recycling story remains intact as the company continues to sell non-core real estate to refinance the project pipeline. Swiss Prime Site Solutions increased its AuM target to CHF >7bn (old: CHF ~7bn), with an EBIT contribution to the Group of CHF >30m (old: CHF ~30m) by 2025. In contrast, Wincasa reduced its AuM target to >70bn (old: CHF~75bn) with an EBIT margin of 12-15% (old: ~15% until 2023). For Jelmoli, SPS expects a ""balanced"" operating EBIT until 2023. View: We support SPS' medium-term strategy. The portfolio shift from Retail to Office and Infrastructure/Logistic is positive, although Infrastructure/Logistic is a crowded place. The targeted growth in Swiss Prime Site Solutions is also positive, although we believe it is increasingly difficult to find suitable assets in the current market environment.

JEN GY,JEN,Nov 30 2021 01:50PM,Jenoptik,Industrials,CMD Feedback: 2025 growth framework and new photonics focus are promising ,"Jenoptik held a thorough and comprehensive capital markets day virtually on 30November with a focus on its new strategy through 2025. We did not get our desired margin and our low-teen organic growth rate, but an in-line guidance with our and consensus estimates. Nevertheless, on a qualitative basis and especially regarding the strategy going forward, we are positively surprised. The focus on Semiconductor & Electronics, Life Sciences & MedTech, and Smart Mobility emphasize the core of Jenoptik's photonics capabilities. Hence, we leave the event with a positive impression overall, even though we think hard targets could have been a little more ambitious. Backed by the recent acquisitions and VINCORION sale, we contend margin tailwinds could have been stronger. We have summarized our key highlights from the event below. ","New Segmentation: In order to highlight the company's photonics core competencies even further, Jenoptik will carve out the automation and automotive metrology business from Light & Production. The remainder, the more photonics-geared part of Light & Production, will be integrated in Light & Optics. This new business unit, called ""Advanced Photonics Solutions,"" will concentrate on the Semiconductor & Electronics, and Life Science & MedTech markets. The Light & Safety business more or less gets rebranded in ""Smart Mobility Solutions"" and potentially is further extended and strengthened via M&A. The Prodomax, Interob and Hommel businesses become non-core business unit that is intended to generate cash for the growth of the other areas. We argued in the past that a more focused photonics business would be core; hence, we welcome the step and assume an eventual divestment, even though we do not think one is imminent. e@ 2025 targets: Jenoptik intends to grow its business to €1.2bn by 2025 and achieve an EBITDA and ROCE (before goodwill) margin of around 20%. We had hoped for more fantasy in our preview, but see the guidance overall in line with our and consensus current estimates. Furthermore, we believe that the guidance, especially with the possibilities of the new Advanced Photonics Solutions division, could prove rather conservative, particularly on the back of the closed Berlin Glas Medical / SwissOptic deal the same day. We expect minor downward adjustments to consensus due to the sale of VINCORION, as we don't believe potential future M&A is included. Growth Strategy: The Advanced Photonics Solutions has mainly grown organically, but also via some select smaller bolt-on acquisitions. The Smart Mobility Solutions segment, on the other hand, will mainly grow via M&A of new technologies, end- markets and broadening of the portfolio, in our view. In addition, an increased use of artificial intelligence should play an important role. This is intended to increase recurring revenues from 44% today to 50% by 2025 and 60% by 2030. Overall, the mix between organic and non-organic growth seems to be quite balanced. Further Takes: Jenoptik intends to dive deeper into the optics business by supplying equipment to inspection and production of displays and display components, which bear high requirements similar to semiconductors. Growing the share-of-wallet within customers as well as increasing market share are key objectives. Extended and virtual reality is another future growth market, as is quantum technology. While not expected to contribute massively to growth by 2025, management sees them as very attractive second-half-of-the-decade growth markets. We believe Human Resources, a deep cultural integration and general operational excellence are further key aspects for Jenoptik in order to keep its competitive position and drive profitability going forward. Including debt, recent deals, potential further divestments and a capital increase, Jenoptik sees a total firepower until 2025E of €650m for potential further M&A activity.",Florian Pfeilschifter,Florian Pfeilschifter,34,,Hold,,EUR,1.54,,1.65,,0.38,0.41,,,,,M,STIFEL_CMD Feedback-_FlashCoNote_Nov 30 2021 01-50PM.pdf,STIFEL_CMD Feedback-_FlashCoNote_Nov 30 2021 01-50PM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=526f1854-2b60-466e-937c-91e5a880214d&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
WIE AV,WIE,Nov 26 2021 01:32AM,Wienerberger,Construction Supplier,CMD Feedback - Plenty In The Tank ," Wienerberger held its 2021 CMD yesterday. The event introduced a guidance for 2022,some useful pointers around inflation and further M&A criteria. e With regard to the 2022 guidance, the Group appears to be conservative at this stage with more upgrade potential held in reserve. e M&A should remain an important driver for the Group, especially if pursued in the value-conscious manner seen for far. e@ The valuation has much more upside from here, and we hence raise our PT to €40 (from €37). ","2022 Guidance Appears Conservative At This Stage The Group reiterated its 2023 Self-Help and Sustainability/ESG targets, both supported by strong performance YTD. More importantly, the Group communicated early on its 2022 guidance (see Figure 1). The EBITDA guidance is in line with consensus (€740-760m vs €755m Visible Alpha consensus and SFe at €746m), but implies rather cautious organic growth. Organic growth is expected to contribute €60m, of which €45m of is Self-Help and mere €15m relate to price-cost and volume contributions. M&A is expected to contribute €50m, which is roughly in line with our estimates. We believe the implied underlying organic growth at +2.3% appears overly conservative. The Group also reverses out a one-off positive effect of €20m from 2021 in its North American piping business in 2022. Overall, the Group seems to have useful leeway for further upgrades next year. Inflation Appears Well Managed, With Upside To The Price-Cost Spread As we know, the Group's strong cost management and supply chain capabilities supported its margin YTD. This should remain the case in 2022, in our view. The cautious hedging strategy should cover most energy costs in 2022 and in part in 2023. That said, wage inflation caused by labor shortages should not be ignored (represents ~31% of its cost base, vs 9% for energy). Management pointed to a possible +3-4% wage inflation going forward. The good news is that the Group has relatively low employee turnover (at 13%). In addition, we would expect further price increases for 2022 in line with 2021 (~4-5%). The price cost spread should hence increase by much more than so far assumed in its guidance. In that sense, the Group appears to be in a much better situation than most of its peers. M&A An Important Driver Of Growth 2021 was a good year in terms of M&A for Wienerberger. The Group has done ~€0.5bn of M&A in 2021. Meridian will have been acquired at a 4.1x cash multiple post synergies after three years. FloPlast and CorkPlastics will have eventually been done at <7x. Going forward, the Group wants to focus its M&A in Europe and North America, basically to enlarge its footprint and increase its system solutions. Valuation remains a key criterion with the Group aiming for a very ambitious EV/EBITDA multiple of ~5x post synergies after three years. Although we would expect most of those deals to be done in its existing divisions, management has not excluded the potential of buying a platform in adjacent product areas such as insulation. In our view, the proposed valuation would be attractive, but we are generally not convinced by the high end of the ND/EBITDA range at 2.5x. The fact that the Group would consider a capital increase is also not something we like, but at the end of the day depends on the deal put to shareholders. Generally, we prefer management teams to self-fund their expansion projects, rather than ask shareholders for money. The Stock's Valuation Still Looks Fairly Attractive At 1.1x 22E its EV/Sales (pre IFRS16) compares to its long-term median at 1.3x. Our 22E valuation methodology implies upside to ~€41-42 (backed up by our SOTP, see Figure 6). We hence raise our PT to €40.",Tobias Woerner,Tobias Woerner,40,37,Buy,,EUR,2.32,,2.81,,0.71,0.77,,,,,M,STIFEL_CMD Feedback_CoNote_Nov 26 2021 01-32AM.pdf,STIFEL_CMD Feedback_CoNote_Nov 26 2021 01-32AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=6e46dbed-d5af-4f1c-b885-e69d41cdebd9&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
HOLN SW,HOLN,Nov 19 2021 01:00AM,Holcim Ltd,Building Materials,CMD Feedback - Some Further Thoughts ,"The Holcim CMD yesterday addressed a multitude of important topics for theGroup. At the end of the day, however, it boils down to the same conclusion we had before. The glass is not even half, but completely empty, when it comes to the perception around ESG for this company. So, every step taken must be seen as an incremental improvement, which should take the stock's rating slowly, but surely out of the ‘sin-bin’ and value camp. Adding the changing macro backdrop to this (with higher commodity prices driving demand in emerging markets), then we would expect the company’s positive bottom-up efforts to feed through to its share price eventually. We would not be surprised to see the long-only camp in particular use this CMD as a catalyst for reflection on the stock. We will have a roadshow with management next week, which should help us understand many of the questions coming out of this CMD. In addition, to our more general conclusion, we would like to highlight the following points: ","The Group has clearly changed its culture towards accountability, competitive leadership and returns. The chaotic days of the post LafargeHolcim merger are well and truly over. This new culture and Jan Jenisch’s drive should really be an important tool to help navigate the Group through this unprecedented change around the decarbonisation of the industry. The Group is going down a multitude of avenues to decarbonise the business and its products. Accelerating green products, the use of technology and diversifying away from cement via M&A probably represents the broadest tool box in the industry. Looking at the various break-out sessions, the Group leaves almost no stone unturned to reduce its carbon footprint. This may look unfocused to some, but should provide the optionality and leadership the industry needs to come out of this on the other side. As we saw with the automotive industry, not taking change seriously is not an option. It appears to us that the penny has clearly dropped with regard to this. We are also reassured by the CEO's response that decarbonisation has to happen within its existing business as well as via diversification within its Solutions & Products segment. Because, at the end of the day, the company can't get away from the fact that it does remain a cement company. The new financial targets should support upgrades to consensus. Putting the top line growth targets in context of the historical operational leverage should provide upside to consensus, in our view. We believe when assuming ~3% top line LFL growth and the historical leverage of 2.83x at the recurring EBIT line, then 2022 and 2025 consensus have upside of ~3% and ~8% respectively. The comment that the 3-5% LFL top line growth range appears low in context of the price increases (of ~5% in 2021 and 2022) seems to miss the point that underlying costs are also going up. So, maybe one should see the principle of the LFL growth target or as we would say the REAL sales growth the Group can achieve until 2025. Also, we would not be surprised to see price inflation be highly volatile over the next few years. Post the Spanish flu in 1918 inflation went up by ~21% and then fell by some -16% only a couple of years afterwards.",Tobias Woerner,Tobias Woerner,65,,Buy,,CHF,4.15,,4.58,,2,2,,,,,M,STIFEL_CMD Feedback_FlashCoNote_Nov 19 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_CMD Feedback_FlashCoNote_Nov 19 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=09f120db-e07f-4ac0-b00c-e05ec4e4bd67&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

SAF FP,SAF,Nov 30 2021 01:00AM,Safran,Aerospace & Defence,CMD Look-Ahead ,"We reiterate our Buy rating on Safran shares, our €150 PT (implying a +48% TSR),and keep our EPS estimates unchanged ahead of Safran's Capital Markets Day (""CMD"") on Thursday, 2 December. Safran shares are down 17% since their recent peak on 10 November, with just over half of that in Friday's session, (vs a CAC 40 Index that is down 4% and the Stoxx A&D Index that is down 13%), which, in our view, provides a buying opportunity for investors who can look beyond the short-term. The most interesting potential, in our view, at the CMD is for a set of 2025 targets, an update on LEAP programme breakeven timing, and some updated anecdotal indications of the strength of engine shop visit demand and aftermarket demand in Q4 and perhaps also into Q1, which should reassure investors of the strength of the equity story here beyond the very short-term, and so possibly prompt a modest re-rating. ","Omicron: factors to balance. This is likely to be a top investor concern, following the sector sell-off on Friday 26 Nov on the news relating to the Omicron variant (aka B.1.1.529) of coronavirus. Clearly, we believe that it is likely to be too early for airlines, ata global aggregate level, to adjust plans for capacity or engine shop visits. We believe that airlines are likely to watch near-term bookings, announced travel restrictions and vaccine efficacy very closely and to measure their response accordingly. Reported mildness of symptoms (according to this report from Reuters), if true, may soften the impact on passengers' propensity to travel. If the spread of this variant transpires to be a dent in the curve of traffic recovery, there is unlikely to be significant deferrals of engine shop visits or aircraft deliveries, which tend to be relatively sticky in an environment of tight capacity and pent-up demand, especially for narrow-bodies, where Safran's exposure is biased. The CMD agenda appears to be relatively undisclosed... Safran has published the agenda for the CMD (which starts at 09:00 CEST), which starts with a visit to the LEAP engine production line at Villaroche, followed by two full sessions during the afternoon, for which the topics are unannounced. ..And based on experience, here are our predictions. During both of its last two CMDs (on 29 Nov 2018 and 24 Mar 2016), Safran laid out 4-year goals for revenue (or revenue growth), margins and cash conversion, although there was no initial guidance for the following FY. CFM/LEAP transition was a topic for both CMDs. Our forecast would be for a new set of 4-year goals (so for 2025), no initial FY-22 guidance, and sessions on the CFM/LEAP transition (perhaps with an updated breakeven chart with an approximate year and negative-to-positive swing in contribution), the turnaround of Aircraft Interiors, and a look at some technology areas. Similarly to MTU, the critical watch issue for us is commentary on AM / shop visit demand... Given that we believe that industry shop visit demand is increasing significantly, due to a reasonably good Northern Hemisphere summer flying season, deferred maintenance during the depths of the pandemic, and lower demand for visits to be performed in Asia, due to greater travel restrictions, we look for datapoints and anecdotal commentary from management about how they see real-time aftermarket (""AM"") and shop visit demand, and demand indicators for FY-22. ...Which was quite positive on Safran's Q3-21 Call. On the Q3-21 Revenues Call on Friday 29 October, management noted that they had seen a ""Big inflow"" of orders for spare parts for November, and that seasonal strength is anticipated ahead of catalogue price increases in January. Safran's key JV partner, GE, stated on its Q3-21 Call that it expected Q4-21 shop visits to be up 30% y/y.",Harry Breach,Harry Breach,150,,Buy,,EUR,2.6,,4.7,,1,1.5,,,,,M,STIFEL_CMD Look-Ahead_FlashCoNote_Nov 30 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_CMD Look-Ahead_FlashCoNote_Nov 30 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=f4164dba-001c-43a3-8277-1bb7fbbdb60c&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
KBX GY,KBX,Nov 29 2021 03:04AM,KNORR-BREMSE AG,Automotive Supplier,CMD presentation — first take: Slightly ahead of estimates ,"FY25 guidance out: revenue €8.1-8.6bn, EBITDA margin 19-21%, EBIT margin14-16% which is slightly ahead of consensus FY25 revenue estimates of €8.1bn, EBITDA margin of 19.4% and EBIT margin of 15.3%. ","At the divisional level, Knorr-Bremse expects RVS to grow by 5-6% p.a. until FY25 to reach an EBIT margin of 18-19.5%, while CVS is expected to grow 7-8% p.a. to reach an EBIT margin of 12-13.5%. While the headline numbers are ahead of consensus estimates, it seems that more than expected EBIT is lost in the translation from divisional to group figures. M&A slides emphasise that the focus is on bolt-on acquisitions in rail and truck and that the focus is not on establishing a third pillar in the business mix. The M&A slides for CVS suggest that there won't be over-ambitious M&A activity. FY25 guidance: As expected, the company unveiled new FY25 targets that are slightly higher than the former FY22 targets. Please find details and a comparison vs. consensus estimates in the table below. As expected, the company's CVS guidance is largely in line with consensus estimates, while the RVS guidance is mostly responsible for the slight beat. That said, it seems as if less divisional EBIT gets translated to group EBIT (group/ divisional EBIT ratio 0.94) in the company guidance compared with consensus estimates (cons. group/divisional EBIT ratio 0.98) which might disappoint some investors.

KBX GY,KBX,Nov 24 2021 01:00AM,KNORR-BREMSE AG,Automotive Supplier,CMD Preview & update: 'Manic Monday' ," On Monday, November 29th, Knorr-Bremse will present an update on its groupand divisional strategy during the CMD ""Shaping the Future of Sustainable Transportation"". We expect to hear about the new mid-term targets as the old FY22 targets are about to expire and some more clarity on the post Hella group strategy. e Post 3Q21 results, we cut our revenue assumptions by 2-3% and reduce our EBIT estimates by 10-12% for FY21 and FY22, respectively. We are now in line with consensus estimates. e Divisionally, we reduce our RVS EBIT assumptions by -9% in FY21 while our CVS EBIT estimate drops by ""only"" -2%. We believe that EBIT in both divisions will decline by roughly -9% in FY22. e We cut our price target to €97 from €100 and reiterate our Hold rating. ","Model update: Post 3Q21 results, we cut our FY21 group revenue assumption by -2% and group EBIT estimate by -10% on the back of a lacklustre RVS performance. As we believe that supply chain issues, raw material costs and Covid-19 will remain a headache in FY22, we reduce our FY22 group revenue forecast by -3% and our group EBIT forecast by -12%. Our new estimates are broadly in line with current consensus estimates and, in our view, reflect the current company guidance of slight to solid revenue growth (which translates to mid-single digit revenue growth) and slight EBIT margin expansion (which translates to 0-50bps expansion). CMD preview: Knorr-Bremse will present an update on the group strategy during a (virtual) Capital Markets Day on November 29th. The CMD header is ""Shaping the Future of Sustainable Transportation"" which doesn't give away too much of what one can expect. We believe that the company will reflect on the current FY22 targets set a couple of years ago which set a FY22 revenue bar of €7,650-8,050m (or 4.5-5.5% CAGR from 2017 levels) and an EBITDA margin of 19.6% (or +150bps from 2017 levels). Given the pandemic, it shouldn't come as a surprise that Knorr-Bremse is quite unlikely to meet these targets. Current consensus estimates look for these targets to be met by FY25 and we expect Knorr-Bremse to set a new set of targets within that range. Obviously, investors will want to know how Knorr-Bremse will achieve the new targets. Subsequently, we believe that the company will focus on the expected post-pandemic situation in RVS which, so far, lacks momentum. We expect to get more tangible evidence on whether the RVS order momentum is improving and hope for an update on the ramifications of the US infrastructure bill as well as the Chinese National Transport Planning Outline 2021-2035. With respect to CVS, the company still has some work to do to convince investors that cash is spent wisely. Post Hella and the announced departure of Dr Laier, CEO of CVS, we are eager to learn how Knorr-Bremse wants to position CVS to ""shape the future of sustainable transportation"" and how much of the required know-how already exists in- house. On the back of our lower earnings estimates, we cut our price target to €97 and reiterate our Hold rating.",Marc Zeck,"Marc Zeck, CFA",97,100,Hold,,EUR,3.68,,4.07,,1.84,2.04,,,,,M,STIFEL_CMD Preview_CoNote_Nov 24 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_CMD Preview_CoNote_Nov 24 2021 01-00AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=33758569-32e9-4e4a-b427-84e47ea72cc2&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
HHFA GY,HHFA,Nov 26 2021 01:34AM,HHLA AG,Transportation,"CMD preview & update: ""Automate This"" "," The company has postponed the CMD, initially planned for 30 November, to14 December due to scheduling issues, we believe. We expect the company to reiterate the FY25 EBIT €300m target. The efficiency measures and automation projects required to make this target will probably be the main focus of the CMD. e Post 3Q21 results, we raise our FY21 and FY22 EBIT estimates by ~20% and ~5%, respectively. The main drivers of the upward revision for FY21 are higher container dwelling fees. e Weare ~7% and ~11% ahead of FY21 and FY22 consensus EBIT estimates as we and the market are essentially back to our pre-March 2021 estimates. Back then, these were lowered when the company delivered the now-defunct disappointing FY21 EBIT guidance. ","Model update Post 3Q21 results, we raise our FY21 EBIT assumptions by ~20% while our FY22 EBIT estimate increases by ~5%. Higher container dwelling fees are the main driver of the increase in FY21 as we believe these will persist for the remainder of the year and will only slowly abate in FY22 as ocean supply chains will only normalise gradually. In our view, the normalisation will mostly benefit the Intermodal division in FY22 while higher volumes in the Container division will mostly be eaten up by lower container dwelling fees. Our new estimates put us ~7% and ~11% ahead of FY21 and FY22 consensus estimates. CMD preview Crucially, the CMD was postponed to 14 December from 30 November which, in itself, will make it a harder for Hamburger Hafen to regain market trust after the accidental early release of 3Q21 figures and the surprisingly low former FY21 EBIT guidance in March 2021. Trust will be essential for Hamburger Hafen as we expect the company to reconfirm the FY25 EBIT €300m target at the CMD as consensus estimates currently don't expect the company to live up to its promise. Meeting the target hinges on the successful implementation of the efficiency and automation projects in the container division. We expect Hamburger Hafen to outline in more detail when the large Burchardkai terminal will finally be automated and how the company intends to push through associated workforce cost savings against union resistance. While the current agenda leaves little room for a significant update on the collaboration talks with Eurogate, the close proximity of the new CMD date to the end of the year when a major update on current negotiations is expected will likely create an ‘elephant in the room' atmosphere. Ultimately, the recent investment of Hapag-Lloyd in the JadeWeserPort of Wilhelmshaven highlights the potential threat of Hapag-Lloyd services migrating from Hamburg to Wilhelmshaven which might jeopardise the path to FY25 EBIT €300m despite automation gains at the Burchardkai terminal.

SWON SW,SWON,Oct 21 2021 01:00AM,SoftwareONE Holding AG,IT Services,CMD Takeaway: A reassuring update ,"FY21 and mid-term guidance are reiterated. 10-20% of gross profit growth isexpected to come from M&A. Software & Cloud should benefit from a confirmed recovery in SME demand. Solutions & Services to be driven by the move to Cloud and to PAYG through the medium-term, by greater cross-selling and by continued progress on the three strategic growth areas. ","e@ (=) FY21 guidance reiterated, with sequentially better gross profit growth and EBITDA margin in 2H. FY21 guidance stands at — (1) gross profit growth above 10% in CC + c.4% from Intergrupo; (2) adjusted EBITDA margin of c.30%; and (3) dividend payout at 30-50%. Near-term, the CEO opined that SME demand continued to improve in 3Q but activity was still below levels seen pre-COVID and should drive a recovery in Software & Cloud. Note that SMEs typically are more profitable for SWON, representing c.20% of billings and c.45% of gross profit of the Software & Cloud segment. This top-line improvement coupled with sequentially flat operating costs (front-loaded in FY21 and managed via natural attrition and selected restructuring/ replacement) should bode well for adjusted EBITDA margin improvement in the second half of the year. (=) Mid-term guidance retained: (1) gross profit growth of mid-teens in CC (incl. bolt- on acquisitions); (2) adj. EBITDA growth in excess of gross profit growth; (3) 28% tax rate; and (4) dividend payout ratio at 30-50%. e@ (+) Increased services cross-selling. Only 12k out of 65k customers purchased both software and services, and represented 66% of 1H21 group gross profit (up from 60% in 1H20). The uplift on gross profit from selling both Services and Software was up from 7.7x in 1H20 to 8.6x in 1H21 (FY19: c.7.0x). (+) Significant tailwind from secular trends. Software & Cloud global spend is expected to grow from $634bn in 2020 to $1,230bn in 2025E, i.e. a CAGR of 14% (12% for Software and 30% for Cloud). This growth in the public cloud should drive global laaS-related spend, which is expected to grow from $64bn in 2020 to $255bn in 2025E, or a CAGR of 32%. We think SWON, given its strategic focus on Microsoft Cloud (Azure, Office 365, Dynamics 365), SAP S/4HANA on Azure, and application modernization of hyper-scale infrastructure, should benefit significantly from these secular trends. Elsewhere, management noted that SoftwareONE currently has >500 certified consultants for SAP on Cloud (2023 target of c.1,000), and another >1,500 certified consultants across Microsoft Clouds (2023 target of c.3000-4000). SWON continues to target incremental gross profit of CH100m by 2023 on the back of its strategic plan launched in 2021. (+) Inorganic growth remains a core strategy; 10-20% of gross profit growth from M&A. SWON is one of the more acquisitive vendors in the industry and management intends to spend c.CHF100m each year for 6-10 bolt-on acquisitions while large transactions should be more opportunistic. Management expects bolt-on acquisitions to represent 10-20% of group gross profit growth annually through the medium-term. Valuation. SoftwareONE currently trades at 25.4x / 20.1x cons 2021 / 2022 EPS vs. the peer group at 31.4x / 28.3x and European IT Services at 23.6x / 18.6x.",Chandramouli Sriraman,Chandramouli Sriraman;Thibault de Coincy,30,,Buy,,CHF,1.01,,1.23,,0.33,0.42,,,,,M,STIFEL_CMD Takeaway-_FlashCoNote_Oct 21 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_CMD Takeaway-_FlashCoNote_Oct 21 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=68ee5971-f894-4988-82af-d00c24a9cc5e&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
BOBNN SW,BOBNN,Nov 11 2021 01:08AM,Bobst,Capital Goods,CMD triggers upward revisions to our FY-22 estimates ,"Encouraging management comments at the CMD about positive order intakemomentum and beneficial order book product mix have triggered our earnings upward revisions for FY-22, with sales forecast up +3% and EBIT up +9%. This results in a very solid EBIT margin of 6.9% and ROCE (NOPAT) of 16.4%. e Bobst is confident about reaching its FY-21 guidance, expects a solid FY-22 result despite a challenging supply chain situation and might be able to reach (some of) the long-term targets (Vision 2025) earlier than initially indicated. In addition, the targeted payout ratio could see positive revisions at the next Board of Directors meeting. e Based on our earnings revisions and an unchanged valuation approach, we increase our price target from CHF 100 to CHF 105 and reiterate our Buy rating. ","Strong order intake, also driven by large order sizes of important clients According to CFO Attilio Tissi, order intake in every month YTD was higher than budgeted, with orders up 65% y-o-y in October (and +100% at mid-year). Whereas large customers have placed orders in the magnitude of CHF 20m in the past, the largest customers ordered machines of around CHF 100m in FY-21, with the second-largest customer ordering machines for CHF 50m (large groups are also planning to place orders in FY-22E). Not surprisingly, Bobst is very satisfied with the order book and even happier with the product mix of orders (large amount of sheet-fed machines with above-average future service business). Various factors to reach long-term operating result (EBIT) margin target of at least 8% Besides a higher top line and scale effects, Bobst's main source to close the gap to its 8% EBIT margin target is a potential breakeven instead of the still significant losses in its digital printing activities (SFe CHF -30m) and at Bobst Bielefeld (quality issues in web-fed activities in the past). Whereas Bobst Bielefeld should reach breakeven by end-FY-22E, it will take until FY-23E or FY-24E to eliminate losses for digital printing. Furthermore, Bobst is outsourcing its IT department to Accenture, with a positive cost impact expected in the medium term. In the short term, higher depreciation of the ERP system (five years instead of seven) will have a negative impact on margins (SFe: 30-50bp). Targeted payout ratio might be lifted? Bobst is somewhat overcapitalised, with net liquidity of more than CHF 100m at end- FY-21E, an unused revolving facility with a syndicate of banks of CHF 200m (to be renewed in May 2022, probably at a reduced level) and debt capacity. Based on a strong free cash flow generation going forward, limited M&A opportunities and paid negative interests on its cash position, Mr Tissi indicated that the current dividend policy might be reviewed at the coming Board of Directors meeting (the company has until now aimed for a payout ratio of 30-50%). Fine-tuned FY-21 earnings estimates and higher FY-22/23 assumptions We leave our FY-21 sales assumption unchanged, but lower our EBIT margin assumption from 5.8% to 5.5% due to higher IT depreciation. However, due to the higher-than-expected extraordinary impact of the property sale in France, our net income forecast remains unchanged (but normalised EPS down -5.9%). For FY-22/23, we increase our sales assumption by +3%/+1% and our margin assumption from 6.6%/7.3% to 6.9%/7.5%, given the high order book (machine backlog of eight to nine months by year-end 2021) and progress in pricing (indexed pricing from mid-FY-21 onwards) and in loss-making businesses. On the back of the expected operating performance, we forecast ROCE (EBIT/NOPAT) to increase very solidly to 21.0%/16.4% in FY-22E.",Christian Arnold,Christian Arnold,105,100,Buy,,CHF,3.85,,5.38,,2,2.5,,,,,M,STIFEL_CMD triggers_CoNote_Nov 11 2021 01-08AM.pdf,STIFEL_CMD triggers_CoNote_Nov 11 2021 01-08AM,EARNINGS UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=7806090a-beb9-440d-8779-bff122bb9f0a&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
COTN SW,COTN,Nov 15 2021 02:06AM,Comet,Technology Hardware,CMD: Upside from mid-term targets ,"Comet is holding its annual investor day today (virtual). The company hasissued a press release on the growth opportunities for all divisions as well as a statement on current 2021 guidance and on the mid-term guidance for 2025, with an absolute revenue target for the first time. We would focus on information around design-wins for matchboxes, first orders expected for the generator this year, opportunities in the advanced packaging market and the ""new"" absolute revenue guidance for 2025. Guidance for 2021 remains unchanged (revenues CHF 480 - 500m, 18% - 20% EBITDA margin). Conclusion: This morning's press release confirms our buy case on Comet. The mid- term target of 2025 revenues of CHF 830m (STe CHF 778.7m) and an EBITDA margin of 25% (SFe 23.5%) now leave room for estimate upgrades in the market (no consensus available, but market was not heading to the upper end of the mid-term guidance). We expect mid-term consensus estimates to go up; we remain Buyers. ","PCT: The growth engine is gaining speed PCT is currently the growth engine for Comet driven by global surging investments in the semiconductor equipment market. Comet states that it has won further design-wins for the matchboxes and expects first orders for its RF generator later this year. The market for the RF generator is now estimated at CHF 1.2bn. IXS repositioning on track — Advanced Packaging the opportunity The repositioning of IXS is well on track. Profitability has increased in 2021 and should see more upside going forward. The biggest opportunity in this division is the advanced packaging market for semiconductors. As chips are becoming smaller and also stacked on top of each other, x-ray technologies are currently the only practical means of finding defects inside the 3D architectures. Comet has already received it first order for the FF 35 semi-system from one of the most renowned Asian semiconductor clients. Advanced Packaging alone is expected to grow 8% p.a. for the next five years. 2021 going well — shortages no problem so far Comet is still optimistic for 2021 and keeps its guidance unchanged (revenue CHF 480 - 500m, EBITDA margin 18% - 20%; SFe CHF 504.5m, EBITDA margin 19.6%). We see upside to these targets but believe the uncertainties around re-emerging Covid-19 cases leave Comet cautious. Supply shortages have not caused any problems yet for Comet and book to bill is well above 1x. Mid-term targets confirmed with an absolute revenue target Comet confirms its mid-term targets for 2025 but specifies them with a revenue target of CHF 830m for 2025 (SFe CHF 778.7m) and an EBITDA margin of 25% (SFe 23.5%) and ROCE of 30% We see further consensus upside on the mid-term targets as the market was still shy to incorporate these high numbers. Investment case well on track — more to come Comet's investment case is well on track. The combination of structural growth, new products and refocusing in the IXS division offer an attractive case compared with other semiconductor related stocks. While the CMD might not act as an immediate trigger and some market participants might have expected more (guidance increase, RF generator orders), we believe the story is well on track and remain buyers. Comet still trades at a discount to the Swiss semiconductor peers (gap has become more narrow) and therefore offers more upside.",Michael Inauen,Michael Inauen,370,,Buy,,CHF,7.92,,9.5,,1.42,1.48,,,,,M,STIFEL_CMD- Upside_FlashCoNote_Nov 15 2021 02-06AM.pdf,STIFEL_CMD- Upside_FlashCoNote_Nov 15 2021 02-06AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=1566f92b-479d-4743-93ae-4bc43d65adaf&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

IFRS16). Rising sales density along with strong store network expansion offer an attractive combination. e JMT continues to deliver the best execution in the sector.

","3Q21 earnings: another impressive quarter from Biedronka in Poland despite retail tax (1.35% of sales) introduction 1st January 2021 Group EBITDA rose 9% (Visible Alpha consensus +7%) in 3Q21 and overall EBITDA margin of 8.1% was flat. Before the retail tax was officially introduced by Polish authorities ist January 2021, investors -and ourselves- were nervous about the outcome when considering the weight of Poland for Jeronimo Martins (respectively 70% of sales and ~80% of EBITDA). Since the 1.35% (of sales) tax was introduced, Biedronka's profitability hardly suffered from the outcome. EBITDA margin was down less than 10bp YTD. A combination of factors made this happen: 1) Basket inflation sustainably below Polish food retail inflation to further reinforce the banner's competitiveness; 2) Higher margin products were introduced to improve margin mix; 3) Discount operations are highly centralized with a stronger fixed cost component than retail industry average. In discount, strong sales growth (8% LFL sales growth in 3Q21, consistent with the YTD trend) is the best possible way to produce operating leverage through optimized fixed costs absorption; 4) Competitors with a weaker top line momentum than Biedronka probably needed to raise prices more aggressively to protect margins, further increasing their price disadvantage; 5) Jeronimo Martins management estimates Biedronka has won another 160bp share YTD to reach 27% of the Polish market. Colombia approaching sweet spot after eight years of investment The Covid-19 pandemic in Colombia might have finally served as a catalyst for Ara as it has put more pressure on households’ purchasing power and further reinforced the relevance of retail banners such as Ara in the country. Ara's store network has grown from 36 stores back in 2013 to c750 stores end-2021 with sales estimated at ~€1bn by year-end. In 3Q21, on a low base, LFL sales grew 40%, triggering YTD LFL sales growth of 23%. Like in Poland, Ara is investing in price (particularly in commodities such as fruit and vegetables) to improve competitiveness, price perception, and customer traffic. Price perception and sales density remain the core priorities as the retail banner has resumed strong expansion (~100 store openings this year with the intention of accelerating openings from next year) after a slowdown last year in context of the pandemic and product-offer optimization. We believe the Ara banner is getting closer to the sweet spot where aggressive store network expansion no more prevents the banner from turning and remaining profitable. Management believes Ara will start self-financing its expansion in two or three years. We estimate Colombia will account for 7% of group's reported EBITDA by 2025 versus 1% today. Our DCF valuation (8.5% WACC, 1% perpetuity growth rate) suggest limited upside potential We updated our JMT model and raised our 2021-23 EPS estimates by ~3-4% on average. We continue to value JMT with a DCF model using unchanged 8.5% WACC and 1% perpetuity growth rate. Our valuation points to €19.3, up from 17.5% previously.

VOW3 GY,VOW3,Dec 08 2021 01:00AM,Volkswagen AG,Automotive,Come on VW - set Porsche free ,"Handelsblatt reports that VW is considering a Porsche IPO. The Porsche/Piech family could sell some VW ordinary shares that they own through there investment in Porsche Holding. This is in line with the structure that we described with our PAH initiation. It would resolve two issues that the family has: the low valuation of VW (4.9x 2022 PE-ratio) and the lost control over Porsche AG, the former family business. We think that the widened spread between VW ords and VW prefs makes such a deal only more attractive for the family. e The deal that the family seems to consider looks messy, another share class, the family buying into Porsche AG, an IPO instead of a (much better) spin-off. However, the valuation gap between where Porsche AG would probably trade as a stand-alone entity and where VW trades today is so significant that it would provide incremental upside to VW prefs (VOWS) as well as Porsche SE (PAH3). ","Structure of the deal: Reuters reported about 'Project Phoenix’ in June and Manager Magazin in October. The structure is supposed to be: VW IPOs a part of Porsche AG (the sports car-maker, 100% owned by VW). The Porsche and Piech family would participate in the IPO as an anchor shareholder through their investment vehicle Porsche Automobil Holding SE (PAH). In order to finance this, PAH would sell some VW ords (they own 53.3% of the VW ords). Rationale for such a deal: Within the Porsche / Piech family, there are probably some members who are keen to have a higher valuation of VW (thus the Porsche IPO) and some members who want to regain control over the former family business (thus PAH as an anchor shareholder). Would Lower Saxony support this? Maybe they would like to increase their stake in VW from 20% to 25%. That would secure a blocking minority in Lower Saxony's biggest employer, even in the unlikely case that the EU would eventually succeed in removing the special rights for Lower Saxony at VW. What could be the value of Porsche AG? We use Ferrari multiples as a starting point. On that basis, Porsche would be worth EUR199bn or EUR398 per VW share, based on 2022 estimates. Yes, not a typo. This is reflecting the 37x EV/EBIT multiple and 49x PE- ratio that Ferrari is trading on. At a 50% discount, Porsche would be worth EUR100bn or EUR199 per VW share (compared to today's VW pref price of EUR170). How much discount to Ferrari? Ferrari is the strongest automotive brand and is valued like a luxury brand, not a car-maker. However, Porsche has a very compelling case to make, too. It already has the highest share of BEVs within VW Group (15.4% BEVs in Q3). And that is with just one BEV being launched, the Taycan. Profitability has not suffered from that. In 2022 Porsche will unveil the electric Macan (Porsche's best-selling product), that should boost the BEV share significantly. No other classic car brand seems so well on track to manage the transition to electric. spin-off would be better than an IPO: Obviously, an IPO would not be what the market really wants. The VW investment case is that the transition towards EVs and autonomous is fully funded from the operating cash flow. VW guides for >EUR10bn in FCF after the needed investments into future technology. However, we believe an IPO is more likely to be supported by unions and Lower Saxony. It limits the upside for VW shareholders. However, given the significant gap to where Porsche AG should trade on stand-alone basis and the 4.9x PE-ratio where VW trades today, an IPO should still provide significant incremental upside.",Daniel Schwarz,"Daniel Schwarz;Pierre-Yves Quémeéner;Alexander Wahl, CFA",308,,Buy,,EUR,29.9,,34.7,,8.36,10.4,,,,,M,STIFEL_Come on_CoNote_Dec 08 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Come on_CoNote_Dec 08 2021 01-00AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=37fbc079-16b6-46d8-8c8d-04aad10c5221&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
ALGTR FP,ALGTR,Nov 18 2021 01:00AM,Groupe TERA,SPONSORED RESEARCH Business Services,Commercial partnership with Flowbird ,"Groupe TERA announced the signing of a commercial partnership with Flowbird.Flowbird's Park & Breathe pollution monitoring stations will now be equipped with Groupe TERA's NextPM sensor. This announcement supports the growth acceleration in the air quality sensors segment. It corroborates the group shifting its strategic focus from the (completed and successful) external growth in the lab segment, to the organic development of the sensors activity. Overall, this strengthens the growth investment case, and we reiterate our Buy rating. ","Flowbird is French company managing connected parking meters and transport ticketing systems for municipalities. The company generates €300m revenue and employs 1,300 people worldwide. It manages 170k connected kiosks and 95k transit ticketing systems in 4,350 cities and 80 countries. Park & Breathe is an air pollution and noise monitoring system installed by Flowbird on some of its parking terminals since 2019. Groupe TERA's NextPM sensor has now been selected to equip the Park & Breathe monitoring stations. Park & Breathe enables local authorities to collect data and support decision-making. We therefore assume that Groupe TERA's NextPM was chosen for its superior reliability. Acceleration in the sensors segment: as highlighted in our H1 results note, we have observed significant sequential growth over the past semesters. In H1, the group sold c.4,000 NextPM sensors, and the division's revenue stood at €0.4m, up from €0.3m in FY-20 and €0.2m in FY-19. This new commercial partnership with Flowbird should fuel further growth from 2022 onwards. In addition, this partnership highlights in our view the quality of the NextPM product. The deployment of the NextPM through Park Breathe could be an additional proof of concept for Groupe TERA, thus helping to secure future contracts and commercial opportunities. Finally, we reiterate that we expect the sensors segment to benefit from significant operating leverage as volumes rise, thus supporting the group's profitability. We reiterate our Buy rating: we continue to see Groupe TERA as an attractive growth stock, with very strong exposure to ESG. After delivering on its external growth, and revenue doubling since IPO, the group now trades on an attractive valuation: 1.6x/1.2x EV/Sales 2021E/22E. @ Link to the French press release",Nicolas Tabor,Nicolas Tabor,5,,Buy,,EUR,-0.1,,0.01,,,,,,,,M,STIFEL_Commercial partnership_FlashCoNote_Nov 18 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Commercial partnership_FlashCoNote_Nov 18 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=e555c8e0-7566-42c8-9cd2-44dbc60ce132&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
SIKA SW,SIKA,Dec 22 2021 02:20AM,Sika,Construction Supplier,Conditional capital to be increased to cover convertible instruments in full ,"An extraordinary shareholders’ meeting will be held on January 25, 2022, in orderto increase conditional capital from currently CHF 155,893.20 (15,589,320 registered shares) to CHF 187,893.20 (18,789,320 registered shares). This is needed as not both convertible instruments are fully covered. Only 65% of the second convertible bond expiring on June 5, 2025, is covered. ","Sika writes in its press release that bondholders could decide to convert the bond early. As per our recent report, we could also imagine that Sika goes for an early redemption of the convertible bond (in 2023) to increase financial flexibility and please credit rating agencies. This could also have triggered the planned early increase of the conditional capital. We make no change in our financial model at this point in time as we included the conversion of the mandatory convertible bond as of January 30, 2022 in our estimates (included in Sika's shareholder capital already). The convertible bond with maturity on June 5, 2025, is still treated as financial debt in our model, for the time being (and no additional outstanding shares). Mandatory convertible bond: A mandatory convertible bond in the amount of CHF 1,300m, which was issued on January 22, 2019 for the financing of the Parex acquisition. The mandatory convertible bond will be converted into approx. 9,950,000 shares which will be issued from the conditional share capital on January 30, 2022. This instrument is already included in Sika's shareholders' capital, hence does not improve Sika's balance sheet (in our model, we increased the numbers of outstanding shares by 9,146,556 as of January 2022). Convertible bond: A convertible bond in the amount of CHF 1,650m, which was issued on May 15, 2018 for the acquisition of the Sika shares held by Compagnie de Saint- Gobain. The convertible bond expires on June 5, 2025. Currently, only approx. 65% of the convertible bond is covered by the conditional share capital. As of December 15, 2021 and due to the increase in Sika’s share price, 15% of the bondholders have decided to convert the bond early. The available conditional share capital was used for this purpose. Early redemption of the convertible bond? In our recent note (Acquisition of MBCC and its impact on the setting of new strategic targets, as of November 17, 2021), we wrote that ""Sika would potentially have the possibility of redeeming early the CHF 1.65bn convertible bond with maturity in FY-2025. According to our information, it could be converted into equity in mid FY-2023, with a 130% premium. Taking the stated conversion price of CHF 189.56 (for about 8.7m new shares) in the last annual report, this would result in a conversion price of around CHF 245. By means of this debt / equity swap, the FY-23E net debt-to-equity ratio would be reduced from 2.5x to 1.9x and the rolling 12-month peak level would be lowered.""

FER SM,FER,Oct 29 2021 01:00AM,Ferrovial,Transportation,Confident Enough To Focus On Investments Again ,"Ferrovial published a solid set of results with the recovery gaining further traction,while being on track with its divestments. Dividend payments are also being resumed at the 407 ETR. It seems that confidence is returning to such an extent that management has taken the 'bold' step of investing in India, one of the world's highest potential infrastructure growth markets. Our LIVE Traffic and PAX Trackers point to further normalisation to an extent where even Heathrow's valuation might recover some ground into 2022. Eventually, the Group may simply sell its stake to maximise value here given the disappointing regulatory review so far. The stock is getting closer to the €30 mark supported by its Canadian and US toll roads, which are in essence inflation resistant moats. ","e@ Q3-21 results are pointing in the right direction, while current data points to further improvement. EBITDA for quarter increased +63% to €175m, which compares to consensus and our estimate at €159m and €171m respectively. Stripping out the €13m gain for SCC shown under Webber, then EBITDA beats consensus by +2%. At the net income level from continuing operations (at €68m vs our adjusted estimate at €3m), the Group performs even better given much lower financial charges (at -€70m vs our -€86m estimate) and a much better result from its Airports associates (with a loss of 'only' -€31m vs our estimate of -€74m). The 407 ETR performed in line with our expectations, and has also announced the restarting of dividend payments. With regard to current trading, our LIVE Traffic and PAX Trackers point to continued improvement (see Figures 2 & 3). Traffic in its US Managed Lanes are above 2019 levels (with the exception of the LBJ). The 407 ETRis steadily recovering towards its 2019 level now, as its lockdowns were much stricter to begin with. The recovery in Toronto should be supported by the resumption of the Roadmap to Reopen published last Monday (25 Oct). Divestments are progressing, while the Group is confident enough to take the next steps towards future growth. The Group also announced the divestment of its Spanish Infrastructure Services business today for an equity value of €171m and an additional earn-out of €50m. Together with divestment of the Environmental Services business for an equity value of €950m and the cash of €253m, the equity value delivered amounts to ~ €1,424m (or ~€1.9/share). Overall, the value of its Spanish Services businesses compares to our €1.6bn equity valuation and is hence ~€0.3/share short. The divestment of Amey in parts and its International Services businesses should add roughly another €0.5-0.6bn in value or €0.6-0.9/share. The company's 9M-21 EBITDA increased +163% LFL with the margin moving to 5% (from 1.3%) possibly provides further upside to this valuation. The process should be finalised by Q2-22. The Group's latest investment of €364m for a 24.9% stake in IRB Infrastructure Developers needs to be seen in this context. This is one of India’s premier concession groups managing 23 projects and 2,000km of toll roads. India is clearly a major growth market when it comes to infrastructure for the next decade. So, in that context this deal is interesting, albeit Ferrovial is only a minority shareholder (with two board seats) in what remains a difficult country to do business in. The deal would value IRB at 10.5x Mar-22E EV/EBITDA, while it currently trades on 9.6x. With this deal Ferrovial remains a non-controlling shareholder behind Virendra D. Mhaiskar and his family holding company. The deal is expected to close in Q1-22. e@ There is hidden value in its Managed Lanes business and possibly even at Heathrow into 2022. The fact that Group has to recognise a €1bn capital gain for the I-66 post the closing of its latest 5.7% transaction (with an implied valuation of €2.8bn) tells you something about the hidden value of the Managed Lanes business. Our SOTP currently values the asset at 1x 2020 invested capital, i.e. €35m. On top of that and as a reminder, Heathrow was valued at €2.2/share before the health crisis. It remains to be seen how much of this value returns? The Group appears unhappy about the latest regulatory review and might eventually just decide to sell its stake to maximise its value here. That said, we wouldn't expect any decision here before the regulatory review is finalised some time next year.",Tobias Woerner,Tobias Woerner,30.5,,Buy,,EUR,0.52,,0.57,,0.57,0.62,,,,,M,STIFEL_Confident Enough_FlashCoNote_Oct 29 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Confident Enough_FlashCoNote_Oct 29 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=cc6a97f8-e607-45f1-a472-89d5dbd95bac&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
ERF FP,ERF,Oct 21 2021 03:42PM,Eurofins,Business Services,Confident tone but little visibility ,"Mgmt. sounded quite confident during the Q3 results conference call, and webelieve the guidance remains too conservative. @ We update our COVID-19 scenario, and thus stand above consensus. However, the range of possible scenarios remains too wide; therefore, we reiterate our Hold rating. ","The company acknowledged that the new guidance was not a warning sign, but rather conservatism. ERF raised its revenue guidance from €6,150m to €6,350m, thus still standing 1% below consensus. The group did not adjust its €1,700m adj. EBITDA guidance for the higher revenue (now standing 6% below consensus). CEO Gilles Martin stated that otherwise it would have needed to raise EBITDA guidance by €35m, implying a 17.5% EBITDA margin for the incremental €200m revenue (vs. 30.8% margin in H1-21). The group stated that the growth in antigen testing volumes in Q3 had been dilutive to the mix. In addition, it expects PCR testing profitability to revert to the 15-25% EBITDA margin range of the Clinical Diagnostic segment over the mid-term. However, this €1,735m adj. EBITDA (vs. €1,805m cons.) would still take into account a conservative scenario in Q4: -1% Core revenue q/q (though the company does not see any risk of slowdown or headwind) and -53% COVID-19 testing revenue q/q. Therefore, we believe one should not read too much into this new guidance, and the “current consensus is quite safe. Core organic acceleration or deceleration? The 2-year stacked Core organic growth decelerated sequentially in Q3 due to the higher comp. base in Q3-19 (the catch-up effect from the Jun-19 cyber-attack). Nevertheless, the 9M performance remains +12%, implying that within a single year Eurofins' Core caught up on the 2020 lost organic growth. The main question now is, will ERF face a tough comp. base and struggle to deliver 5% Core organic growth in 2022E? Mgmt. seemed quite confident they could beat their mid-term guidance. This should be driven notably by strong demand in the BioPharma segment. In addition, the group is expecting to pass on cost inflation through 3-6% price increases from January (while wage increases are mostly in April), above the historical range of 1-3%. Q4 COVID-19 testing scenario: -26% q/q (vs. -50% guidance). ERF assumes €150m COVID-19 testing revenue, down -53% q/q. Mgmt. stated that they had chosen to remain conservative due to the lack of visibility, and that considering the current October run- rate (and rising cases in the UK) they could beat that guidance. We forecast €239m in Q4, down -26% q/q, based on -40% volume and +23% price/mix (as antigen should fall faster than PCR). We provide more details on our assumptions on page 3. Overall, we thus expect c.€1.3bn COVID-19 revenue in 2021E, vs. €1.2bn guidance. FY-22 COVID-19 testing scenario: -56% y/y, up from -75%. The group declined to make any guidance on COVID-19 testing beyond Q4 due to the lack of visibility. Based on the stronger-than-expected resilience of the demand, and assuming a quite linear phase out, we now forecast €562m / €259m COVID-19 testing revenue in 2022/23E, up c.+100% and c.+50% vs. our previous estimates. We reiterate our Hold rating as the range of possibilities remains too wide. On a bull case scenario, Core organic growth accelerates in 2022 driven by strong underlying demand and price increases, and COVID-19 testing remains high. On a bear case scenario, the Core business remains sluggish as it faces tough comps and COVID-19 testing declines rapidly. However, we come out of the call uncertain of the potential direction, and thus reiterate our Hold rating.",Nicolas Tabor,"Nicolas Tabor;Simon Lechipre, CFA",105,,Hold,,EUR,4.39,,3.45,,1.04,0.82,,,,,M,STIFEL_Confident tone_CoNote_Oct 21 2021 03-42PM.pdf,STIFEL_Confident tone_CoNote_Oct 21 2021 03-42PM,EARNINGS UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=39043255-67d6-4bcf-9548-e1856df0cd68&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
NEOEN FP,NEOEN,Nov 30 2021 01:02AM,NEOEN,Utilities,Deep dive into Mexico's potential energy reform ,"In this note, we provide some insight from a recent discussion with local journalistsabout the potential energy reform in Mexico. While the likelihood of the reform being adopted is very low today, there could be financial consequences for Neoen if it is, most probably not before summer 2022. e We update our financial estimates up to 2025. We estimate an EBITDA CAGR of 21% and a net income CAGR of 48%. We expect 3.5 GW of operating capacity by end-2021, 4.5 GW by end-2022 and 8.8 GW by end-2025. e We set a new Price Target of €48 and reiterate our Buy rating. ","Potential energy reform in Mexico would endanger renewable operators Our recent discussion with local journalists in Mexico has brought two main conclusions: the probability of the reform being adopted is very low today, but in the event of it happening, there would be financial and operational consequences for Neoen. The reform seeks to prioritise the hydro and thermal power plants of the state utility CFE. This would result in a complete reversal of the merit order on which the current system relies, which is based on the marginal cost of production of the last power plant to enter operation. Efficient gas-fired power plants and renewable power plants would be the main losers of the reform. In addition to this re-dispatch of power plants, all contracts with other off-takers than CFE would be cancelled, re-negotiated and re-routed to CFE. All kinds of existing contracts are at risk, including the PPA contract of the ""El Llano"" park, a 375 MW solar park owned by Neoen. How would the impact on Neoen unfold? Around 70% of the volumes produced by El Llano are sold to a consortium that includes CFE at a price of $18.93/MWh, and the remaining 30% are sold on the merchant market at higher prices. Should the reform be adopted, we understand that contract re- negotiation could result in 100% of the volumes being sold to CFE, hence preventing Neoen from benefiting from the upside of merchant prices. Assuming merchant prices of €40/MWh, we calculate a net impact of around €6.0m (2% of EBITDA guidance 2021, based on mid-point). In addition, the reform could result in the implementation of higher grid fees paid by renewable operators, resulting in further expropriation of profits. Fortunately, physical appropriation of the assets looks very unlikely today. Reform unlikely to be adopted We understand that the situation is blurry for everyone, even for local energy experts and lawyers, and that current debate on the reform is on hold. Indeed, ruling party Morena needs support from opposition party PRI to reach 66% of both lower and upper chambers of congress in order to pass it, but a recent political dispute between the two parties have frozen talks. Hence, a re-start of the reform debate is not expected before June 2022, and the likelihood of it being adopted remains very low today. New Price Target of €48 and Buy rating reiterated We take into consideration Neoen's recent change in guidance, which implies capacity in operation of 5 GW during 2023 vs end-2022 initially expected. The firm remains impacted by cost inflation and supply chain issues, but we continue to believe that Neoen will rank among the winners in the industry when the situation normalises. We cut our PT from €52 to €48. We use a DCF method over 35 years based on a WACC of 4%. Our PT implies EV/EBITDA of 20.6x in 2022E and 18.9x in 2023E. These expensive multiples are justified by an expected 21% EBITDA CAGR and 48% net income over 2021-25, which stands at the very high end of renewable operators in Europe.",Martin Tessier,Martin Tessier,48,52,Buy,,EUR,0.25,,0.38,,0,0,,,,,M,STIFEL_Deep dive_CoNote_Nov 30 2021 01-02AM.pdf,STIFEL_Deep dive_CoNote_Nov 30 2021 01-02AM,COMPANY REPORT,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=d01728f5-ae08-4740-bf29-20b28db6d714&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
INS GR,INS,Nov 25 2021 02:08AM,Instone Real Estate Group,Real Estate,Delayed but not derailed ,"With this note, we transfer primary coverage of Instone to Tom Carstairs.@ Supply chain bottlenecks and permit delays have delayed the recognition of earnings for Instone, but we argue the long-term story remains intact, and the company is well- placed to benefit from the need for new construction in Germany. e Earnings recognition may have been delayed but the long-term value proposition has been enhanced with land acquisitions helping to drive strong NAV growth in the quarter. e Project delays remain a key risk. Guidance reflects the current situation facing developers in Germany, but consensus does not. ","Guidance in focus Bottlenecks in the supply chain coupled with permit approval delays explained the disappointing guidance, which has dictated Instone's share price performance since the results. Revenue guidance was the primary area of weakness relative to market expectations and vs previous indications for 2022, and was only partly offset by the positive outlook for margins. The market was evidently taken by surprise by the outlook, in part due to management confidence at H121. We have sympathy for the pace at which the situation changed due to factors outside the control of the company. Nevertheless, confidence in guidance will have taken a hit. Consensus ignoring guidance For a company such as Instone, where earnings visibility is limited, guidance is all the more important. We have taken a red pen to our estimates and our FY22E adjusted earnings as the tax estimate of €94.0m sits within the range (€90-€100m) provided by the company. While the share price has adjusted to the news, consensus estimates have not, and remain significantly above the guidance range. We take some comfort as the share price seems to have adjusted ahead of the sell side, but there remains the risk that the inevitable downgrades will put further pressure on the share price. Reasons to remain positive The disappointing outlook overshadowed everything else, but there were certainly positive takeaways from the Q3 release: (1) new approvals of €1.4bn YTD have seen the project portfolio increase from €6.0bn at FY20 to €7.2bn at Nov-21. (2) Growth of the project pipeline during the quarter saw prospective net asset value increase by 14% since H121.

Estimate & target price changes Our FY21 earnings after tax estimate increases by 10% despite lower revenue expectations due to a significant step up of the assumed gross profit margin (from 25.2% to 28.5%) and a lower tax rate assumption while our FY22E estimate falls by 8% despite higher gross margin (26.0% vs 25.1%) assumption, with lower revenues (€925m vs €1,100m previously) the primary driver and a lower assumed tax rate partially offsetting the impact at the bottom line. We have reduced our DCF/peer-based valuation by 22%, from €36.0 to €28.0. The 43% implied upside reflects an attractive valuation angle.

VOW3 GY,VOW3,Nov 22 2021 01:00AM,Volkswagen AG,Automotive,Diess O : Unions 2 ,"The ongoing conflict between unions and CEO Diess weighs on the investmentcase. In 2020, the result of the conflict was that Ducati and Lamborghini are not being sold and Mr. Diess gave up the position as VW brand CEO. Now he might also lose the responsibility for the mass market group. e FAZ reports that the supervisory board found a compromise in the new conflict: Mr. Diess remains CEO, but within the VW Group board he gives up the responsibility for the VW brand as well as for the mass brands to VW brand CEO Brandstatter. Mr. Brandstatter would become member of the VW Group board. The article says that in the event Mr. Diess is still ousted, Porsche AG CEO Blume would be a potential successor. The article adds: '...however, Blume is understood to be working on a partial IPO' of Porsche AG. e Conclusion: If the article is correct, the bottom line is positive. Mr. Diess remains CEO anda Porsche IPO is an option. However, the return on the ongoing conflict with unions seems to be questionable: Mr. Diess loses responsibilities while he does not win concessions from the unions (other than remaining CEO). ","Diess remains CEO, Brandstatter becomes board member: In September, CEO Diess asked his strategy team to look into scenarios for the Wolfsburg plant, including a potential reduction of the workforce by 30k employees (c. 50% of the workforce). This had not been coordinated with the unions and the Works Council felt betrayed. In an interview (Handelsblatt, 5 November), Works Council Chairwoman Daniela Cavallo said that Diess might not be the right CEO going forward. The supervisory board had to mediate once again. According to the article, the new-found compromise provides that Diess remains CEO of VW Group but gives up responsibility for the VW brand and the mass market brands within the VW board. Instead, Ralf Brandstatter becomes a new member of the VW board and takes over these responsibilities. The article says that Brandstatter is supported by unions due to his communication and involvement with unions. win for unions: If the outcome of the recent conflict is that CEO Diess publicly denies plans for new job cuts and loses more responsibilities to Brandstatter, we would argue it is a net negative for Diess - and for shareholders. However, we believe a replacement of Diess at this point would be more negative. VW could be perceived as run by unions and resistant to change. In our view, if confirmed, the compromise is a positive. Daniela Cavallo probably strengthened her position ahead of the upcoming Works Council election. This is the second large conflict between CEO Diess and unions, and in both cases Diess ended up with reduced responsibilities. Oliver Blume is busy with a Porsche IPO? The article says that Porsche AG CEO Blume could be a potential successor in case Diess leaves. Judging from the past two years, we contend the VW supervisory board would be well-advised to prepare for such scenario. The article says that Blume is busy preparing a partial IPO of Porsche AG. We continue to believe that a Porsche IPO is an option in 2022 - after the Works Council election (we assume in March) and before Wolfgang Porsche's term in the supervisory board expires in early 2023. Potential asset sales are an important part of the VW investment case. However, instead of asset sales VW bought assets (Europcar, Navistar, Gotion and there were media reports about potential interest in McLaren). As we see it, an IPO of Porsche would be very positive for the investment case, in terms of valuation uplift and sentiment.",Daniel Schwarz,"Daniel Schwarz;Pierre-Yves Quémeéner;Alexander Wahl, CFA",308,,Buy,,EUR,29.9,,34.7,,8.36,10.4,,,,,M,STIFEL_Diess 0_CoNote_Nov 22 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Diess 0_CoNote_Nov 22 2021 01-00AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=98a6c35a-b4f5-400a-b900-b80e8a5025a5&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
AD NA,AD,Nov 16 2021 01:00AM,Ahold Delhaize,Retail,"Digital acceleration, margin question mark ","Ahold Delhaize is doubling down on digital after a slow pre-Covid start in the U.S.e Post-Covid normalization in the U.S. has not materialized yet. A higher share of eating-at-home has persisted throughout 2021, and management believes it will persist beyond Covid-19. The jury is still out. e The IPO of bol.com (non-food leading Dutch online retailer) is scheduled for 2H22. Pending more data, we estimate bol.com's EV at €3.9bn or ~9% of AD's current EV. e We raise our PT to €30 (from €25) based on less negative (although still declining) margin assumptions. Hold rating confirmed. ","Doubling down on digital Over the last couple of years, Ahold Delhaize (AD) has doubled down on digital investments. In the U.S. AD was late rather than early, versus leading competitors, to pursue its digital transformation. Back in 2019, Ahold Delhaize's (AD's) U.S. online sales only accounted for 2.5% of its total sales in the country, reflecting this slow start. AD management intensified investments: 1) Acquisition of Fresh Direct end-2019, a pure online grocery retail operating in Greater NYC and Pennsylvania. In 2021, we estimate the group's online penetration will reach 7.6% (vs. 4.3% in FY20). To scale the business and improve the omnichannel consumer experience, AD management is combining commercial brands (Food Lion, Stop & Shop, Giant, Hannaford...) and support brands/ platforms (Peapod Digital labs, Retail Business Services...). Some online operations are more advanced in Europe where they will reach c15% of total sales in FY21 driven by bol.com (acquired in 2012) that has been propelled to the position of leading online non- food retailer in the Benelux. Finally, management is targeting €1bn incremental sales in 2025 (3x more than in 2021) from new and more profitable revenue streams leveraging on data (media, advertising...). Financial implications In the U.S. online sales relate solely to groceries. Profitability dilution has been limited so far by: 1) Click & collect: over 50% of AD's U.S. online sales derive from click & collect, limiting the burden on profitability as home delivery is much more costly to operate. Out of c2,100 stores operated in the U.S., c1,400 will have click & collect capabilities by FY21 year-end. Management is testing different micro-fulfillment solutions (three in all, of which one was acquired with the Fresh Direct acquisition); 2) Strong acceleration in U.S. online groceries has taken place at the same time as Covid-19's supportive impact on sales. Stronger operating leverage has more than offset the growing online sales penetration. Growing online penetration could become more of a drag in a post-Covid normalizing world. Management expects a higher share of eating at home (home office) to persist after Covid-19. The jury is still out, and we remain on the cautious side (table 2 p4). bol.com first take: €3.9bn EV In Europe, we estimate bol.com's FY21 sales at €2.7bn or almost 60% of the region's online sales. bol.com has been profitable at the EBIT line since 2019 as it is geared to non-food with a strong market place (60% of its €5.5bn net online consumer sales). Pending more data, we estimate bol.com's EV at €3.9bn (1.2x 2022 EV/Sales) or ~9% of AD's EV. See table 3/chart 7 page 5. PT raised to €30 (from €25), Hold rating maintained We value AD with a DCF model with unchanged 8.5% WACC and 0.5% perpetuity growth rate (sensitivity analysis table 1 page 4).",Cedric Lecasble,Cedric Lecasble,30,25,Hold,,EUR,2.15,,2.08,,0.97,1.04,,,,,M,"STIFEL_Digital acceleration,_CoNote_Nov 16 2021 01-00AM.pdf","STIFEL_Digital acceleration,_CoNote_Nov 16 2021 01-00AM",COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=b4d191b6-eb85-47b8-9f23-bb9a110709fd&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
MC FP,MC,Dec 01 2021 07:09AM,LVMH,Consumer Goods,Dior catching up with Chanel / tweaking Q4 forecasts: F&LG (+) ,"What’s in this note? Deep-dive analysis of Christian Dior, which should finish 2021with revenues in excess of €9bn (including €3.2bn for Dior Beauty), on our estimates. This is comparable to our projected 2021E revenues for Gucci or Hermés and should further narrow the gap relative to its arch-rival Chanel. Dior has enjoyed extraordinary growth since 2017, but we argue that there is plenty of headroom for growth and margin expansion in coming years. In the short-term, we expect Dior to shine again in 4Q21 as the fastest-growing brand in the F&LG division, which should end the year on a high note. What’s changed? We increased our FY21-22E earnings forecasts by 1% (with higher Q4 assumptions for the F&LG division more than offsetting slightly lower H2 margin assumptions for Selective Retailing) and lifted our PT to €800. Buy. ","The House of Dior should further narrow the gap relative to Chanel in 2021, finishing another year of exceptional growth with a revenue base comparable to Gucci and Hermés. We estimate that Dior Couture should end 2021 with revenues of €6.2bn, which is c.3x bigger than the €2bn sales base that Dior reported for the 12-month period ending March 2017. If we add estimated revenues of €3.2bn from Dior Beauty, this means that the House of Dior should end 2021 with €9.4bn revenues, which is similar to Gucci and marginally ahead of Hermés, on our forecasts. Moreover, this means that Dior should have further narrowed the gap relative to Chanel, whose management recently indicated FY21 revenues to the tune of $13.7bn (+35% y-o-y) or €11.7bn. This means a 2021 revenue base for Chanel 1.2x bigger than Dior, which compares to 1.5x bigger in 2019 and 1.8x bigger in 2017 (when Dior was first consolidated into LVMH). Dior enjoys significant untapped growth potential in coming years thanks to: Untapped store network development with 250 directly-operated stores (vs. 198 in 2017), which is smaller than Chanel's network, more exclusive than smaller peers like Prada or YSL and substantially under-developed relative to LV or Gucci; Untapped development potential in leather goods (<50% of Dior sales, compared to c.55% of sales for Gucci and Prada and north of 70% of LV sales); Untapped penetration potential in Americas, where Dior remains under-penetrated relative to Chanel, which derives c.1/5 of its sales from Americas. Untapped potential to develop its men's business; Untapped potential in skincare for Dior Beauty, especially in China; Digital leadership in China as illustrated by its leading presence on WeChat. Dior Couture enjoys untapped margin development potential when compared to other mega-brands. We estimate an operating margin to the tune of 25% for Dior (vs. 13.5% in 2017). This compares to 28.5% for Chanel (its CFO said in June that Chanel margins should be back to 2019 levels), c.38% for Gucci and c.37% for and Cartier, based on our forecasts. Similar to Chanel and Hermés, Dior enjoys strong pricing power and has a very strong CEO in Pietro Beccari to drive imagines higher over time, in our view. Dior brand heat remains very strong. Dior's recent exceptional growth rates should eventually normalise, but not yet, we think. In 4Q21 to date, Dior is enjoying accelerating growth of its Weibo fan base, the strongest earned media value in the last 3 months in the sector, accelerating momentum on Google Trends and strong double-digit growth on YouTube followers, just to name a few metrics.",Rogerio Fujimori,Rogerio Fujimori,800,770,Buy,,EUR,21,,23.7,,6.9,7.9,,,,,M,STIFEL_Dior catching_CoNote_Dec 01 2021 07-09AM.pdf,STIFEL_Dior catching_CoNote_Dec 01 2021 07-09AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=743d5212-381f-46b5-9163-8fb2fa3a4e58&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
VOW3 GY,VOW3,Oct 21 2021 10:17AM,Volkswagen AG,Automotive,Discussion around a Porsche IPO seems to become more concrete ,"The Manager Magazin published an article on VW and Porsche. The article saysthat the Porsche/Piech families are considering an IPO of Porsche AG. That would unlock value in their main asset VW. Secondly, it would allow the family to buy back a stake within the Porsche AG. This is in line with the scenario we described ","in our Porsche initiation. An IPO has been discussed in the past. New: the article mentions that the investment bank Goldman Sachs and the law firm Freshfields are working on this transaction. Why would such a deal be attractive for the family? We think the family has two main issues: Firstly, PAH is currently one of the cheapest stocks in the STOXX 600. Following the purchase of the 14.7% stake from Ferdinand Piech, some family members even have leveraged position in PAH. Hence, the share price performance and valuation must be disappointing. Secondly, the families lost control over the core business, Porsche AG. This was the price they paid for the failed takeover of VW (Porsche AG was sold to VW in order to deleverage PAH SE). We believe this is not a minor issue to the families. A Porsche IPO could solve both issues: We believe it would increase the value of VW, and thus PAH. At the same time, the family could buy into such an IPO and regain some control over Porsche AG. Why now? In another report we described that now is a most critical time for the Porsche/Piech families, as the majority of voting rights is going from the third to the fourth generation. That could lead to structural changes, including a Porsche IPO. In terms of timing, 2022 could be realistic: in March 2022 there will be the works' council election, any bigger deal before that is very unlikely. In early 2023, Wolfgang Porsche will likely retire from the VW supervisory board - he would probably control such a transaction. That means, the most likely potential window would be: Q2 2022-Q42022.",Daniel Schwarz,"Daniel Schwarz;Pierre-Yves Quémeéner;Alexander Wahl, CFA",312,,Buy,,EUR,30.4,,35.4,,8.5,10.6,,,,,M,STIFEL_Discussion around_FlashCoNote_Oct 21 2021 10-17AM.pdf,STIFEL_Discussion around_FlashCoNote_Oct 21 2021 10-17AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=04e6dcdd-f92e-4e2a-bc1f-599b93b91293&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
SIX2 GY,SIX2,Oct 25 2021 12:18PM,Sixt SE,Transportation,Does Hertz’ Tesla order hold implications for the car rental market? ,"Hertz made a bold move today, releasing a big order for 100k Teslas. While theorder is probably aimed for some short-term market share wins, the aspect that it represents >20% of Hertz's current fleet provides some food for thought on ramifications for the car rental market and its players including Sixt. Our brief discussion below does not, however, alter our view on SIX2. Buy rating and PT of €165 reiterated. ","Hertz orders 100k Teslas, ... Hertz announced today that it ordered 100k Tesla vehicles for delivery by the end of 2022. The official press release mentions ‘beginning in early November and expanding through year-end, customers will be able to rent a Tesla Model at Hertz airport and neighborhood locations in U.S. major markets and select cities in Europe’. A Bloomberg article on the matter stated that Hertz was said to purchase the vehicles basically without discount as its primary interest was to lock-in 1/10 of Tesla's production first. ... a bold move with a lot of marketable attention, ... Surely, for Knighthead and Certares, the investors behind Hertz’ strong lifeline, the news comes with a lot of marketable attention. While we never believed in Hertz going out of the market, it still needs much more than 100k Teslas - or said more precisely - many more vehicles to return to past glory: Hertz had a fleet of 716k vehicles in 2019 which was about halved to the level seen in Q1 21, but is set to grow again thanks to backing by investors. We can hardly imagine Hertz will market the Tesla vehicles within its budget brands while at the same time, we are surprised to see that Tesla seems ready to deliver on the back of the chip shortage. Hertz should need to rapidly build its own (super)charger infrastructure, which they also addressed in the release. Surely, the announced push into EV rental now needs to live up to expectations practically. ... but also a sign of more influence from OEMs in the rental space? Clearly, Sixt is not waiting and is fleeting in more and more electric vehicles (recall also the €50m infrastructure investment program). So far, the fleeting in may rather mirror the increased OEM production share of EVs rather than that there is already a strong push from consumers, in our view. In any case, Sixt itself should be too small still in the US to copy the move of Hertz (Sixt's US fleet should have 23k on average in 2021E, we reckon, largely combustion driven). Nevertheless, we think 2022 could be a test of Sixt's purchasing power in light of short supply. The big long-term question is whether the move by Hertz is another expression for 'OEM disintermediation’ sneaking in, i.e. OEMs to take control over the rental market (Volkswagen / Europcar and now Hertz makes itself quite dependent on Tesla). We have also elaborated on related, relevant topics in our recent initiation report. Surely, we should not forget about more than 70% of the US rental market being dominated by Enterprise and AvisBudget. Their actions amid the chip crisis-induced vehicle short supply situation will be another factor to watch. Unchanged view on SIX2 In principle, Sixt's success is based on a strong brand and a focus on the premium segment, we think, associated with a good level of service, among other aspects. We believe that to stay independent, a continuation of this strategy should be key while Sixt has shown innovative power with new mobility offers recently. On the positive side, OEMs should have an interest in fencing off competition from Tesla where they can, which may even originate support for the likes of Sixt, i.e. independent rental companies. In the short-run, Sixt should continue to benefit from price hikes while in the medium-term, the supply side may normalize, so that Sixt can resume its market share gains and volume growth path in the US as well.

MTX GY,MTX,Nov 19 2021 01:00AM,MTU Aero Engines,Aerospace & Defence,"Don't Sweat the Margins, Feel the Top-Line ","We reiterate our Buy rating on MTU shares, nudge up our above-consensus EPSestimates, and leave our PT unchanged at €240 (implying a +30% TSR) following its Analyst Day yesterday. We see the slight share price weakness yesterday as a buying opportunity. We also include an ESG Assessment in this note. e The Analyst Day showed the strength of top-line growth in coming years, with ~22% in FY-22 and an implied CAGR of ~14% from FY-21 to FY-24, and the likely rapid recovery of OEM Segment margins to 25% (vs 19.7%, according to Visible Alpha consensus, for FY-21). Its Commercial MRO revenues are expected to be back to pre-COVID levels by FY-21 or FY-22. However, Commercial MRO margins are expected to remain in a 5-6% range, though maybe above that in FY-24, whereas current Visible Alpha consensus looked for 8.7% in FY-24 (and we had looked for 6.4%). We believe that there are three reasons to find this to be conservative, which we mention later in this note. e@ Overall, we see it as neutral for our thesis that MTU is a revenue and cashflow recovery story, with a favourable bias towards the faster narrowbody and short- haul recovery. The revenue story clearly benefits from the expected top-line growth in FY-22 and the CAGR to FY-24 (where we calculate that the implied group revenue is ~7% above Visible Alpha consensus), though on the cashflow side, there was no guidance given for FY-22, and the Commercial MRO margin guidance disappointed us slightly. We remind investors of the scale of MTU's typical conservatism even for the next financial year, and thus all the more so for periods that are three years away. e The share price reaction (down 2% on Thursday vs a flat DAX index and a flat Stoxx A&D index) reflects, we believe, disappointment at guidance for FY-22 (which was slightly sub-consensus, though MTU historically has beaten its initial consensus by a mean 7% from FY-15 to FY-19), and on Commercial MRO segment margin guidance. e YTD, MTU shares are down -13%, vs +15% for the DAX index, and +12% for the Stoxx A&D index. MTU shares trade around the top 4 of European A&D on most trading multiples, and they are high vs its history, but we see this as justified by a projected strong EPS recovery CAGR of 22% (FY-20 to FY-23), benefiting from a depressed FY-20 base, and by low reinvestment needs (and rising cash conversion) going forward. ","Above-consensus EPS estimates nudged up for FY-21 & FY-22. Our “Adjusted EPS” estimates are €6.25 for 2021E (up 1% vs €6.20 previously) and €8.45 for 2022E (up 2% vs €8.30 previously). The changes mainly reflect higher OEM Segment revenue and margins, partly offset by lower Commercial MRO segment margins. They are +7% /+7% above current I/B/E/S median consensus of €5.86 (FY-21) and €7.93 (FY-22). Valuation and Next Event. MTU shares trade at 22x 2022E EPS, falling to 18x 2023E EPS (vs. the Euro. Civil Aero. mean of 27x / 19x). On EV/FCF, reflecting MTU’s net debt and pension, it trades more expensively at 36x 2022E FCF, falling to 26x 2023E FCF (vs. peers on 33x / 22x).

The 7% increase in net debt vs end 2020 was in line with our estimate, and it was mainly determined by an acceleration in investments, dividend payments in the period and the seasonal increase in working capital in Q3. ","We have a Hold rating on the stock. Our PT offers limited upside vs the current share price. We think that the share price fairly reflects the difficult progress of the tenders for the renewal of Italian gas distribution concessions, which prevents unlocking the value creation opportunities that would arise for Italgas. We do not expect a penalising outcome from the ongoing regulatory review for WACC in electricity and gas-regulated businesses in Italy. Detailed Q3-21 results are the following: Revenues grew by 3% y/y to €340m, in line with estimates. Revenues benefited froma higher contribution from non-regulated businesses than in Q3-20 driven by the energy efficiency business, which more than offset the €12m one-off recovery of regulated tariffs accounted last year. e@ Operating costs in line with the same period in 2020 resulted in 3% improvement in EBITDA to €260m. On an adjusted basis (net of the tariff recovery accounted in Q3-20), y/y EBITDA growth was 8%. e@ Higher DD&As driven by capex acceleration mitigated the impact of EBITDA growth on the bottom line. Reported net profit increased by 5% y/y to €98m (higher than our €94m estimate). On an adjusted basis, the easy comparison was double-digits at 16%. Investments continued the positive trend reported in previous quarters, reaching €192m (+3% y/y). In the 9M-21 period, capex increased by 10% to €613m. Net debt at the end of the period was 7% higher than at end-2020, reaching €5.06bn. As we anticipated, the increase was mainly due to capex acceleration, dividend payments and the seasonal increase in working capital in Q3, which we expect to normalise by year-end.",Enrico Bartoli,Enrico Bartoli,6.02,,Hold,,EUR,0.45,,0.5,,0.29,0.32,,,,,M,STIFEL_Double-digit EPS_FlashCoNote_Oct 27 2021 02-55AM.pdf,STIFEL_Double-digit EPS_FlashCoNote_Oct 27 2021 02-55AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=302451b1-1bfa-4c4a-b721-b8166d1ddcac&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
HEI GY,HEI,Nov 04 2021 03:33AM,HeidelbergCement AG,Building Materials,Due To Recover Lost Ground Into 2022? ,HeidelbergCement Q3-21 results have proven somewhat weaker than expected given theheadwinds. FY-21 consensus could be trimmed somewhat on the back of this. That ,"e Significant value, especially when the market's perception changes on ESG. At 5.9x '22;EV/EBITDA (pre IFRS16), we have rarely seen the stock so attractively valued over the last thirt;years (see Figure 9). Similar to Holcim, we expect the reflation story to result in higher commodit;prices and hence bond yields impacting the growth value differential. Also, with regard to ESG;it might be time to put the argument on its head. In other words, what can companies in th;‘sin-bin' do to improve their relative performance and close the gap with what are significan;valuation discounts vs the ESG ‘darlings’? We are in particular interested in value stocks, whic;can reinvent themselves, also with the help of new technology, over the next 5-7 years; said, guidance has been partially raised, despite the pressure on earnings. Further price increases, a new €500m cost savings program to mitigate cost inflation, the recent decline in the coal price and the normalisation of previously omitted COVID-19 costs should help the Group to recover lost ground. With useful exposure to Europe, Emerging Markets and Indonesia in particular, we would not be surprised to see the stock eventually outperform quite strongly on the back of the reflation theme and measures taken. Stimulus plans and its indirect exposure to commodities should drive demand and pricing. The latest deal in Tanzania should also refocus investors on the Group's core business in Africa, where demand and pricing seem to be on the rise again. More importantly, the Group seems to be getting to grips with the challenge around ESG and should eventually turn investors’ negative perception into a positive one using technology as a way of lowering COz2 emissions. Given the value on offer, the glass is not even half full, but rather totally empty. So, any incremental change should have a disproportionally positive impact. BUY with a PT of €85. e@ Q3-21 results below expectations, but guidance partly raised and measures put in place. LFL Operating EBITDA declined -10.7% to €1,176m missing consensus and our estimate by (-2.8% and -5.3%, respectively). The price cost spread was negative to the tune of -€178m. This was expected to an extent, given higher energy costs, weather and more omitted COVID-19 costs returning. By region, the Group did worst in Asia Pacific, missing consensus by -10.3%, due to the lockdowns. The effect should be alleviated by higher end demand in Q4-21 and 2022, in our view, with a recovery already unfolding. WSE also missed consensus by -6.6%, because of operational issues in France and probably also the return of the previously omitted COVID-19. This should no longer be that much of an issue in Q4-21, as cost comps should become easier. Actually, you can see the positive underlying trends in NEECA (especially in CEE), where the Group outperformed consensus by +1.2%. North America and Africa-Eastern Med missed expectations by -2.1% and -5.4% respectively, mainly due to higher freight and import costs. On a more positive note, guidance was raised with regard to ROIC (now >9% vs >8% previously), while ND/EBITDA is now seen <1.5x (previously 1.5-2.0x). Operational and net capex guidance were left unchanged, albeit consensus EBITDA for 2021 probably has to come down by >2%. Finally, the Group has announced a new €500m cost savings program to mitigate higher cost inflation in 2022. But investors should not for forget that the Group has the right geographic exposure, in our view, with Indonesia being a very interesting market for years to come. With the EU's Next Generation Recovery Plan starting to feed through, we would expect this to leave its mark in terms of demand and also pricing. Europe, at ~40% of EBITDA, is important, while many of its emerging markets should benefit from a built-in hedge against higher commodity prices. Emerging markets represent ~31% of 2021E EBITDA and ~50% of the Group's cement capacities (see Figures 2 & 3). More importantly, we believe that the potential from HeidelbergCement's Indonesian subsidiary, Indocement, has been completely missed (see Figures 4 & 5). Indonesia (~5% and ~14% of Group EBITDA and cement capacity respectively) in particular could surprise on the upside over the next few years given that it is one of the world’s largest coal exporters. It also owns ~22% of the world’s nickel reserves, which could turn it into the Saudi Arabia of the future EV economy. As a reminder, Indocement earned ~€552m or 22% of Group EBITDA and had a market cap of €6.5bn in 2012. Today, the company earns <€200m in EBITDA and has a market cap of €2.7bn and is 51% owned by HeidelbergCement. We would not be surprised for these earnings come under pressure from higher coal costs in the near term, before the benefit of higher GDP in the country starts to kick in, in a major way. As result, Indocement’s market cap may well move back to or above its previous highs over the next 2-5 years. Finally, we believe the latest deal in Tanzania should refocus investors’ minds on the Group's core business again also in Africa, where demand and pricing is being driven by higher commodity prices. Our latest Pan-Africa pricing data for Oct-21 (see Figures 6 & 7) points to a recovery there, after stabilising in 2020/21.",Tobias Woerner,Tobias Woerner,85,,Buy,,EUR,8.04,,8.81,,2.3,2.51,,,,,M,STIFEL_Due To_FlashCoNote_Nov 04 2021 03-33AM.pdf,STIFEL_Due To_FlashCoNote_Nov 04 2021 03-33AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=4e3a7121-1893-4785-96db-d442fb48de75&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
CFR SW,CFR,Nov 17 2021 01:26AM,Richemont,Consumer Goods,Early X-mas gift: further upward momentum ,"What’s changed? We lifted our FY22-23E sales by 4-5% and our FY22-23E EBIT by29% and 25%, respectively, on the back of significantly better-than- expected 1H22 results last Friday. Richemont said it will become a minority shareholder of YNAP, hence we changed our price target methodology to a sum-of-the-parts model with a zero corporate structure discount (from a DCF model previously), which partially explains our price target hike to CFH165 (from CHF 122). e Upgrading to Buy. The stock had a great run in the last month, but given the magnitude of the earnings upgrade and the untapped potential value upside from the announced future plans for YNAP with Farfetch, the upside to our PT target is comparable to other Buy-rated stocks in our coverage, hence our move to Buy: better late than never. We are cognisant of China macro/COVID risks and growth normalisation risks for sector valuations, but we feel that investors are more comfortable with the potential risks from China's common prosperity policy and shifting towards higher-quality stocks offering strong pricing power in an inflationary environment and positive market share momentum - Richemont's core jewellery and watches businesses tick both boxes and should be a core holding for LT investors. e Thesis. Cartier is ‘alive and kicking’ in an attractive jewellery category, while Specialist Watchmarkets are making a stronger-than-expected comeback with profitability back to attractive levels. Over the last three years, the strength of its hard luxury portfolio has been diluted by YNAP’s triple-digit operating losses, but this will change with Richemont’s plans to become a minority shareholder of YNAP. This should bring significant cash proceeds for Richemont and make YNAP a more relevant platform for luxury brands and luxury consumers with the help of Farfetch. ","Early Christmas gift to shareholders, with several positives including: Jewellery Maisons look stronger than ever, with continued top-line strength (+39% two-year growth in 2Q22 vs. +43% in 1Q22) and outstanding margin performance (37.9% in 1H22, well above their past 15-year average margin of 31%). e@ Specialist Watchmakers enjoyed strong sequential improvement (+13% two- year in 2Q22 vs. +7% in 1Q22) and margins rebounded to 22.4% (well above their past 15-year average margin of 18% in FY07-21). Other Maisons delivered strong sequential improvement (+14% two-year in 2Q22 vs. -8% in 1Q22) and produced a positive profit in 1H22 after many years of losses. e@ Online Distributors losses were wider than expected, but Richemont now has a clear plan leading to a future deconsolidation of YNAP. Advanced talks with Farfetch to create a platform in which Richemont, Farfetch and other investors would become minority shareholders, with YNAP leveraging Farfetch Platform Solutions to transition to a hybrid model and Richemont’s hard luxury maisons joining Farfetch’s leading marketplace. Richemont should receive cash proceeds from Farfetch and other investors and remove YNAP’s losses from its operating results. Potential sources of upside risk include greater-than-expected cash proceeds (as Richemont gives up its majority stake) and improving performance from YNAP with Farfetch's help (in which Richemont will get its fair share). Valuation still reasonable. Comparatives will get more challenging in 2H22 and volatility should stay due to COVID restrictions, but Cartier's brand heat, the group's strong online capabilities and a more balanced geo mix (Americas accounted for 22% of 1H22 sales) should help Richemont manage these headwinds better than most peers. Despite the stock's recent move, Richemont's valuation still looks reasonable at c.20x calendar 2022E EV/EBIT vs. a sector average of c.23x and Swatch at c.12x, on our numbers.",Rogerio Fujimori,Rogerio Fujimori,165,122,Buy , Hold ,EUR,4.41,,5.25,,2,3.34,,,,,M,STIFEL_Early X-mas_CoNote_Nov 17 2021 01-26AM.pdf,STIFEL_Early X-mas_CoNote_Nov 17 2021 01-26AM,EARNINGS UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=3a6fc290-030b-4778-848d-61977ea6cf83&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
SGL GY,SGL,Nov 15 2021 01:00AM,SGL Carbon SE,Chemicals,Earnings on track - balance sheet improved ,"Q3 results confirmed our positive view on the earnings trend. We increase ourestimates slightly with higher expectations for Graphite Solutions but lower for Carbon Fibres. e Graphite's book-to-bill ratio of >1 and strong momentum in the high margin end- markets speak for ongoing growth in 2022. e Carbon Fibres saw stable sales q/q with the automotive industry, which we see as a sign of strength. However, the textile fibres are hit by higher energy costs. e Progress in net debt reduction supports valuation. We reiterate our Buy rating with an unchanged PT of EUR 11. ","Graphite is on track with strong growth in high margin end-markets: Semiconductor, LED and automotive represented 40% of segment sales in 9M-21. Automotive sales have been flat q/q, as SGL is mainly exposed to luxury cars and EVs. Cost efficiency measures and the improving mix lifted the EBITDA margin to >20%. The book-to-bill ratio is >1. Given the long lead-time in production of 6-7 months, there is high evidence of ongoing top- and bottom-line growth in 2022, in our view. SGL is expanding capacities for battery graphite anode material (GAM) in Poland, which will be available as of H2-22. Samples of GAM were sent out to the whole European battery industry and SGL received positive feedback. Carbon Fibres shows ongoing good business with the automotive industry (Q3 q/q stable sales), but short-term risk going forward due to the slowdown in auto production cannot be excluded. Segment earnings are affected by higher energy costs at its precursor and textile fibre plant in Portugal. While earnings were down q/q, they are still significantly up y/y. Composite Solutions: Earnings were as high as in Q2 showing that the earnings increase is not a one-time event. The new battery casing contract for a US EV truck/SUV OEM can add EUR 10m sales in 2022, which in combination with rising business in wind energy helps to offset in part the end of the BMW i3 contract ending mid-22 (reflected in our forecast). Progress in restructuring: group savings already reached the targeted EUR 100m and an additional EUR 15m were identified. As the cost saving program runs until 2023, there might be more to come. Net debt fell by EUR 55m during Q3. Solid operating cash flow, capex discipline (2021 capex guidance reduced from EUR 60m to EUR 50m), the sale of real estate (EUR 31m) and JV dividend of EUR 10m were the main drivers of the strong FCF. Pensions came down by another c. EUR 10m due to higher discount rates in Q3 and might fall further by EUR >10m due to introduction of a capital option for pensions in Germany in Q4.

DPW GY,DPW,Dec 14 2021 06:11AM,Deutsche Post DHL,Transportation,"EBIT and FCF re-based, but not valuation ","Driven by the concern that freight rates have passed their inflection point, the stock's P/Ehas now dropped from ~14x to 12x (2023e). This ignores the fact that 88% of the company's EBIT has no link to freight rates. Instead, the doubling of EBIT and quadrupling of FCF since 2019 have been mainly driven by volumes and operation leverage in Express, along with P&P, Supply Chain, and eCommerce Solutions, which all follow completely different pricing mechanics. For the remaining 12% (Forwarding), there are self-help measures in place to compensate for the impact once freight rates do normalise. So, in contrast to what the derating of the shares implies, EBIT/FCF levels are not transitory and carry every little risk from rate normalisation. We believe the new 2024 guidance (provided in March) will help to correct misconceptions, while highlighting post-pandemic earnings drivers. With FY-21 set for a strong finish, we stick to our Buy rating and €75 price target. ","EBIT/FCF transformation, but to no avail for the share's valuation Since 2019, EBIT has almost doubled from €4.1bn (FY-19) to €7.8bn (FY-21e). FCF has quadrupled from €0.9bn to €3.8bn (SFe). The share appreciated >50%, but the P/E has only been stable (~14x), and even dropped to 12x (2023) recently. We think the market is not only ignoring better earnings quality (much improved FCF) and stronger structural growth (eCommerce in Parcel/Express, self-help in Forwarding), which both would have warranted a re-rating, but it also no longer seems to believe in current earnings expectations. Misconception 1: High exposure to freight rates, which have now inflected. While we disagree with the narrative of falling freight rates in the first place (see today's European Logistics: No such thing as ""pre-crisis"" margins), in reality, 88% of the group's EBIT has no link to freight rates: Express (53% of EBIT), P&P (19%), Supply Chain (11%) and eCommerce Services (5%) all follow completely different pricing mechanics (GRIs or regulated). Most notably for Express, this is crucial to understand: pricing is done via well established GRls, following a stable path of only 4-5% p.a. (in contrast air freight rates jumped >100% during the pandemic). So, Express earnings have been driven by volumes and operating leverage, not pricing. Express is a highly consolidated premium niche market (UPS, FedEx and DHL = 90% market share). Thus, this stable, moderate pricing trend is set to continue. Ultimately, only Forwarding (12% of EBIT) has a link to freight rates. Even here, we see a limited impact on EBIT once freight rates do normalise, as self-help among other things will compensate (see our sector piece). Misconception 2: EBIT was supported by transitory pandemic-related volume support. In reality, the new level of B2C eCommerce volumes, established during COVID-19, is proving to be sustainable. In Q3, German parcel volumes continued to grow by +4.6% y/y, although there was no support from lockdowns, which boosted last year's Q3 parcel volumes by 12% y/y. In DHL Express, B2C eCommerce volumes also continued to grow (+1% y/y), despite last year's exceptional 45%. Conclusion: New EBIT/FCF level a solid base for further growth. The company will provide updated mid-term EBIT guidance on 9 March, now based on 2024, i.e. covering the full post- pandemic period. As we believe every segment has an attractive, non-COVID-related story to tell (see: Story beyond COVID-19 remains attractive), we estimate 2024 EBIT at €9bn, up from €7.8bn this year. Stick to Buy, PT €75, current valuation looks an entry opportunity. 2021 is off to a strong finish, with eCommerce volumes again benefiting from renewed lockdown discussions ahead of Christmas. The regular dividend (40-60% payout), should rise sharply (SFe: €2, up from €1.35), but based on our FY-21e FCF of ~€3.8bn, there remains >€1bn in excess cash available for additional shareholder returns.

LXS GY,LXS,Nov 04 2021 03:24AM,Lanxess,Chemicals,EBITDA at the low end of guidance range ,"Lanxess delivered Q3 clean EBITDA of EUR 278m (+44% y/y, Stifel: EUR 273m, consensus:EUR 276m), therefore in line with expectations. Full-year EBITDA guidance was specified to be at the lower end of the EUR 1,000-1.050m range. The guidance implies c. EUR 200m for Q4, which is flat y/y (consensus: c. EUR 240m). As Lanxess does not hedge energy costs, the headwind will be felt even more in Q4. Operating cash flow was again weak with just EUR 105m and even 9M FCF is negative. ","Engineering Materials showed a seasonal earnings dip, which does not come as a surprise given the automotive exposure and the normal seasonal pattern. The EBITDA margin was at 14.2% (Q2: 16%). However, the outcome is slightly better than expected. Advanced Intermediates felt short of our expectations explained by again strong headwind from energy costs, as it is the most energy intensive segment within the Lanxess group. This will be also an issue in Q4, in our view. e@ Consumer Protection was not able to manage an earnings increase y/y and EBITDA was down q/q, as an unplanned shutdown at Saltigo reduced sales at this high margin unit. The +22% sales from the acquisition of Emerald Kalama became not visible in the EBITDA. Compared to the high base, volume increased only by 1%. Specialty Additives continued the sequential upward trend. The EBITDA was a strong beat compared to our assumptions. The segment is therefore the highlight in the otherwise muted set of results in Q3. As seen before at Clariant, we assume that Lanxess benefits from the rising demand for flame retardants. The strong industrial production supports the demand for lubricants. Oil & gas as well as aviation end-markets are recovering. The EBITDA margin improved by 210bps, but at just 16.9% there should still be upside. The margin is partly explained by the diluting effect of EUR 300m sales of low margin rubber chemicals allocated to Rheinchemie. e@ FCF: 9M FCF was negative and clearly a weak spot. Operating cash flow was just EUR 128m after 9M, due to substantial outflow for NWC of c. EUR 500m. After capex of EUR 271m, FCF was EUR - 4 m.

1COV GY,1COV,Nov 08 2021 02:16AM,Covestro,Chemicals,EBITDA guidance raised despite headwinds ,"Covestro raised its FY21 EBITDA guidance to €3-3.2bn (mark-to-market: EUR3.2bn) from €2.7-3.1bn, putting consensus at the lower end with €3bn (Stifel: €3.3bn) on the back of the higher margin outlook. The Q4-21 implied EBITDA guidance of €580-780m compares to consensus at €612m and Stifel at €794m. With this, Covestro demonstrates its pricing power given the raw material and energy cost headwinds, whcih accelerated in recent months. We see this as a strong ","outcome. 2022 moving parts: Covestro reduced its 2021 core volume growth guidance by -3% (from 10-15% to 10-12%, of which 6% RFM consolidation) on the back of unplanned shutdowns, inventory build-up and additional maintenance. This implies for Covestro an even stronger footing for volume growth in FY22. The current mark-to-market EBITDA of €3.2bn (unchanged from last update) implies a healthy exit rate for next year. Q3-21 in line: Solutions & Specialties EBITDA margin saw a sequential margin decline of -300bps driven by negative pricing delta i.e. raw material and energy cost increases. However, Covestro was successful in passing on the costs with a positive development in Performance Materials with a sequential EBITDA margin increase of +80bps. FOC strong: Covestro generated €381m FOCF in Q3 (Q2: €374m, 9M: €1,073m). The cash generation was held back by higher NWC requirements (Q3: €-356m, 9M: €-936m) and increased cash taxes (Q3: €-133m, 9M: €-309m). Covestro reduced the FOCF guidance for 2021 from €1.6-2.0bn to €1.4-1.7bn.

ENEL IM,ENEL,Oct 28 2021 01:00AM,Enel,Utilities,Enel Americas reported high double-digit EBITDA growth in Q3-21 ,"Enel Americas (ENIA US, not rated), Enel's subsidiary operating in Argentina,Brazil, Colombia and Peru, reported another quarter of high double-digit growth. Recovery of electricity demand in all countries and tariff increases recognized to the Brazilian electricity distribution companies were the main growth drivers. EBITDA increased by 29% y/y on a like-for-like basis. Net profit increased by 39% y/ y. Enel Americas installed 0.4GW of new renewable capacity in Q3-21. At the end of the period it had 2.7GW of renewable projects in execution and a 55.6GW pipeline. ","Enel America's results are consistent with our estimate for Enel's EBITDA in the Latin American business (Enel is publishing Q3/9M-21 results on 4 November, please refer to our note published on 27 October). They confirm the strong recovery in Enel's business in Latin America after the negative impact on electricity demand from the Covid pandemic in 2020. Data on installation of renewable capacity by Enel Americas confirmed strong execution and the large potential for Enel's investments in this area. In our opinion, Enel's share price has been excessively penalized in the recent months by the increased regulatory risk in Spain. In our opinion, the current share price is not properly reflecting Enel's value creation potential arising from its position as global leader in renewables and its exposure to energy transition. The stock trades at what we view as attractive multiples, and it offers visible dividend yields in excess of 5%. Enel Americas' detailed results in Q3-21 are as follows: EBITDA increased by 47% y/y to US$1,066m. On like-for-like basis (net of the contribution from renewable power plants acquired from Enel in 2021), EBITDA grew by 29% y/y to US$932m. e@ High double-digit growth in Q3-21 followed the 53% y/y increase in EBITDA reported in Q2. Main growth driver was represented by Brazil, wnere EBITDA grew by 73% y/y to US $518m. Growth was mainly driven by tariff increases allowed to electricity distribution companies and recovery in electricity demand. Double-digit EBITDA growth was reported also in the other countries: 1) +17% y/y in Argentina to US$49m, 2) +18% y/y in Colombia to US$344m, 3) +12% y/y in Peru to US$126m. Electricity demand continued to recover in all countries where Enel Americas operates. In Q3-21 it increased by 4.4% y/y for the company's electricity distribution subsidiaries. Cumulative growth in 9M-21 amounted to 5.3% versus the same period of 2020. Additions of renewable power generation capacity continued in the quarter. In Q3-21 Enel Americas added 0.4GW of the new capacity (mainly in Brazil) reaching a total of 4.4GW. The company has 2.7GW of projects in execution (under construction or ready-to-build), expected to be completed in 2021-23 (mainly in Brazil and Colombia). At the end of Q3, Enel Americas had a renewable pipeline of 55.6GW, including 33GW in mature stage. Net debt grew by 32% versus end 2020 to US$5.83bn, mainly due to sharp acceleration in capex, dividend payments in the period and increasing working capital (mainly determined by high power prices in Brazil as result of the drought), which is partly expected to be reduced by year end.",Enrico Bartoli,Enrico Bartoli,9.2,,Buy,,EUR,0.52,,0.54,,0.38,0.4,,,,,M,STIFEL_Enel Americas_FlashCoNote_Oct 28 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Enel Americas_FlashCoNote_Oct 28 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=0e243544-6be8-49fc-968b-c259a68364fd&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
SCHP SW,SCHP,Nov 02 2021 04:36PM,Schindler,Industrials,Entering at the ground floor; up to Buy ,"We continue to expect the Chinese new equipment market to be stable in 2022(leading indicators already start to bottom out); we also expect new equipment outside China and service markets globally to continue to grow. e We estimate China new equipment to explain c.10% of Schindler EBIT while service explains >75%. With the negative news now out (China, cost inflation) and Q3-21 likely marking trough performance (toughest comps, availability of supply) we consider the recent share price decline (c.-20%) as increasingly overdone. e Our price target of CHF 295 (from CHF 315) implies c.25% potential upside and a FY-23 EV/EBIT Schindler adjusted of c.20.0x, c.22% above the five-year trailing average (comparable to elevator premiums this August); we upgrade our rating to Buy (from Hold). ","Key China elevator market leading indicators start to bottom out from July Floor space (FS) started in September decreased 14% y/y after declines of 17% in August and 21% in July. The slowdown is best explained by a stepping up of government cooling measures (e.g., “three red lines policy”) and a resulting deleveraging at Chinese developers. That said, July seems to mark the trough and less negative reads sequentially are likely. FS started leads investment in real estate, which is a more imminent leading indicator. Of the official data, investment also correlates best with the China new elevator market. Investment in real estate in September declined 3% y/y and compares with 0% and positive 1% before. China new equipment market to take a breather in 2022, RoW to continue to expand China, with about two-thirds of the 2020 global new equipment unit order intake, is the most important elevator new equipment market. In line with leading indicators, we continue to estimate the Chinese end-market to remain stable in 2022 with a slight decline in H1-22 and resumption of growth from H2-22. This is slightly more positive than recent OEM commentary, with both Schindler and KONE now expecting a slight 2022 decline. Compared with 2015-2016, we expect pricing pressure this time to be lower, best explained by the industry now having a lower margin profile. Outside China, we expect new equipment end-markets to grow in 2022. China and cost inflation news now out, recent share price decline is overdone For both KONE (KNEBV FH, Hold, EUR 58.44) and Schindler, the service business is the single most important EBIT driver (Stifel estimate >60% of FY-19 KONE EBIT adj., >75% for Schindler). We expect the service end-markets to continue to grow in 2022. Pricing power across businesses should be strong, with the notable exception of China new equipment (Stifel estimate c.10% of Schindler EBIT). We now reflect the China slowdown, cost inflation and execution risks, and lower our FY 22-23 estimates by c.10% on average (now in line with consensus). With the negative news now out (China, cost inflation) and Q3-21 likely marking trough performance (toughest comps, availability of supply), we consider the recent share price decline (c.-20%) as overdone. Fair value implies c.25% potential upside for Schindler, up to Buy from Hold On our estimates, Schindler trades on a FY-23 EV/EBIT Schindler adjusted of c.15.9x, vs the five-year trailing average of c.16.3x (c.2% below). To capture Schindler’s strong EBIT growth relative to the sector, we value the shares with a DCF methodology that yields a price target of CHF 295 (from CHF 315). This implies c.25% potential upside and a FY-23 EV/EBIT Schindler adjusted of c.20.0x, c.22% above the five-year trailing average (comparable to elevator premiums this August). With the negative news now out, we expect strong EBIT growth to again become the main share price driver.

PMAG SW,PMAG,Nov 24 2021 01:45AM,PIERER Mobility,SPONSORED RESEARCH Capital Goods,Entering North American cycle market via FELT Bicycles acquisition ,"PIERER Mobility strengthens its bicycles business by via the acquisition of FELTBicycles, entering the North American market as well as broadening its bicycles offering. ","No financial details (sales, purchase price) were announced (back in 2017 when Rossignol bought FELT, the company generated sales of more than USD 60m). Hence, this transaction should strengthen PIERER Mobility's bicycles business (SFe EUR 128m or 6% of group sales), but the financial impact on group level is limited. However, the company can add a well-known, high-performance and respected bicycle brand to its portfolio (e.g. used by 4x Ironman World Champion Hawaii winner and 5x Ironman 70.3 World Champion Daniela Ryf), which should help to build up its bicycle portfolio further. FELT Bicycles: Founded in 1991 in California, USA, FELT Bicycles produces high- performance, drop-bar road, triathlon, track, cyclocross, gravel and adventure bikes. FELT Bicycles has pioneered carbon fibre usage in bike design, set new standards in mountain bike suspension systems, and revolutionised aerodynamic development in the pursuit of the ultimate racing equipment. What is behind this transaction? The acquisition of FELT Bicycles consists of three components: the purchase of the FELT brand assets, business assets in Europe and in North America as well as the integration of the global workforce into PIERER E- Bikes GmbH's team structure. With this transaction, PIERER Mobility will increase its regional footprint (SFe some 95% of its bicycles sales are done in Germany, Austria and Switzerland). No disclosures of financials: Back in 2017 when Rossignol bought FELT, the company generated sales of more than USD 60m. We expect sales to be lower today, given that the product assortment was streamlined during the ownership of Rossignol and the negative impact of the pandemic on sports events in the past two years. The purchase price was not announced either (but we believe it was rather modest, as PIERER Mobility buys mainly the brand, some working capital and access to the distributor network).",Christian Arnold,Christian Arnold,90,,Buy,,EUR,4.01,,3.57,,0.5,0.5,,,,,M,STIFEL_Entering North_FlashCoNote_Nov 24 2021 01-45AM.pdf,STIFEL_Entering North_FlashCoNote_Nov 24 2021 01-45AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=ca4b376d-65be-4fbb-9c90-5fd340b85dd1&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
VOS GY,VOS,Oct 28 2021 05:35AM,Vossloh,Capital Goods,Erratum: 3Q21 Results: First Take - EBIT beat thanks to decent cost control ,"An earlier version of this report stated that the company 'managed to improve workingcapital intensity significantly, which released about €58m in cash’. The correct figure is €15.8m. ","Vossloh reported better-than-expected 3Q21 results thanks to decent cost control. 3Q21 revenues came in at €235.8m, slightly ahead of company-compiled consensus estimates (CCCe) of €231m but, more importantly, EBIT came in at €19.8m (8.4% EBIT margin), significantly ahead of CCCe €16.8m (e7.3% EBIT margin). The result was driven by the Core Components division, which delivered 3Q21 EBIT of €10.1m (9.3% EBIT margin) vs CCCe €7.6m (e7.8% EBIT margin) while the remaining division delivered results broadly in line with expectations. We believe the beat in Core Components is important as investors were worried about input cost pressure which the company apparently controlled quite well. Group orders hit €207m, in line with expectations. 3Q21 FCF came in at €25.5m slightly ahead of 2Q21 FCF (€24.4m), driven by strong working capital management. Input cost pressure less harsh than expected: Ahead of results, investors’ main worries circled around potential input cost pressure and supply chain disruption. Subsequently, consensus estimates expected 3Q21 EBIT margins to drop to 7.3% from 11.9% in 2Q21. The reported 3Q21 EBIT margin of 8.4% is therefore much better than expected and should alleviate investor concerns somewhat. We await the conference call to learn about management expectations around input costs for the remainder of the year and FY22. FCF performance surprisingly strong: While there are no FCF consensus numbers available, we believe the strong 3Q21 FCF of €25.5m will please investors. While 3Q21 EBIT came in at €19.8m versus 2Q21 EBIT of €30.3m, the company managed to improve working capital intensity significantly, which released about €15.8m in cash. Here again, we are looking forward to the conference call to learn if the current working capital intensity is sustainable. FY21 guidance confirmed: The company confirmed the FY21 revenue forecast of €900-950m as well as the FY21 EBIT margin forecast of 7-8%. At the upper end of the guidance, this implies 4Q21 EBIT of €14m that might be achievable.

SGO FP,SGO,Dec 06 2021 11:11AM,Compagnie de Saint Gobain,Building Materials,Erratum: GCP Applied Technologies: Filling In The Gaps ,"Erratum: In our previously published note, Figure 2 had some incorrect figures. Thosefigures have been amended and the new table is herein. The Saint Gobain conference call re the GCP Applied Technologies acquisition was quite extensive and covered a lot of ground. While the strategic fit appears very sound, the question about price and quality of assets is one which needs to be proven over time. The sellers are known to be extremely value focused, while the synergies are high compared to the revenue base. The valuation also needs to be put in context of Saint Gobain’s much lower rating. GCP’s performance in terms of growth and returns was poor over the last few years, requiring Saint Gobain to pull all leavers to transform and integrate this acquisition successfully. The rewards could be high in terms of building a large, global construction chemicals platform with hopefully higher margins and most importantly returns. Delivery and transparent future reporting will hence be key, in our view. ","e@ What about the price? Using Saint Gobain's estimates for GCP Applied Technologies ('GCP’) the valuations point to 13.2x and 8.8x EV/EBITDA (pre and post synergies on an EV of USD2.3bn). That being said, these are 2022 Saint Gobain estimates, which are slightly ahead of Bloomberg consensus and more importantly >25% ahead of the 2021 consensus base. Although the Group feels optimistic about the earnings progression into 2022, this still needs to be delivered. Also, the deal assumes USD85m of synergies (85% cost and 15% top line), which amount to >8% of revenues. Although explained in detail by management, these need to be delivered first. The Group talks about earnings accretion of +4% before synergies in year one, which is slightly ahead of our own estimates (see Figure 2). The implied ROIC points to ~4.5% and ~7.4% pre and post synergies on our numbers. The Group continues to buy back its shares at 6x 22E EV/EBITDA this year, which remains the benchmark here. At the end of the day, the sellers (Starboard and Standard Investments) are known for being extremely value focused, while their irrevocable commitment may tell you something. The good news is that it is unlikely for an interloper to show its hand, while the strategic fit is very good, subject to a turnaround and successful integration of GCP. Consistent and transparent reporting will be important to build confidence here, in our view. e@ What about the strategic fit? The strategic fit between GCP, Chryso and the heritage Saint Gobain construction chemicals businesses (Weber and CertainTeed) in terms of geography, product and scale effects makes a great deal of sense. GCP was an underperformer in terms of margins when compared to Chryso (13% vs 20% during 2018 and 2021). Sales CAGR at GCP vs Chryso was also significantly lower (-5% vs +8% respectively) during the same time period. This should provide for some upside here, as GCP is bedded down in a more stable environment alongside the wider platform. Actually, management disclosed that GCP looked at Chryso before, while the Saint Gobain management has followed the U.S. company for some time. The global fit between Chryso and GCP hence seems to create scale in concrete admixtures and cement additives (~USD1.2bn of revenues combined) as part of the High Performance Solutions division. This may well be a positive in terms of R&D, innovation and distribution. The fit of the roofing and waterproofing businesses (USD250m of revenues) with CertainTeed makes a great deal of sense, as it fits nicely with its large and leading U.S. roofing business. e@ What about the ultimate reward? Putting all the above together Saint Gobain will end up with €4bn revenue business in construction chemicals and related products. As we know from Sika (covered by our colleague Christian Arnold) this business can deliver high organic growth, good margins and above industry average returns (within a 10-20% range). The Group, when asked, mentioned EBITDA and EBIT margins of ~18-20% and ~13-14% respectively on a normalised basis, while we all know that >10% ROICs should be possible in this industry. The question is how good the assets are, how much more investment they need and how the in-price eventually stands up in the test of time? The growth trends seem almost undoubted in as far as the sustainability drivers in the building materials and cement & concrete world are concerned. The Group puts the growth potential some 200bp ahead of its own target or at 5-7%, which also ties in with Chryso.",Tobias Woerner,Tobias Woerner,63,,Hold,,EUR,5.14,,5.3,,2.05,2.12,,,,,M,STIFEL_Erratum- GCP_FlashCoNote_Dec 06 2021 11-11AM.pdf,STIFEL_Erratum- GCP_FlashCoNote_Dec 06 2021 11-11AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=d3f0575e-0f9e-4488-a9dc-45f27f433651&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
DPW GY,DPW,Nov 08 2021 01:00AM,Deutsche Post DHL,Transportation,Erratum: Story beyond COVID-19 remains attractive ,"Erratum: In the original version of this note, our p2 2024/25E numbers were incorrect.We think DPW will manage the transition from COVID-19-related abnormal results, back to structural growth well. Firstly, we don't think disruptions in global supply chains will be resolved quickly, leading to a gradual/manageable normalization in freight rates in Forwarding and prolonged volume support for Express. Secondly, the new level of B2C eCommerce, established during COVID-19 to the benefit of German Parcels and DHL Express, is proving to be sustainable. Lastly - probably most importantly - we see a highly attractive investment case beyond COVID-19, based on structural growth in Express (consolidated market; B2B eCommerce), self-help in Forwarding (increasing GP/ EBIT conversion), pricing discipline in P&P (letter & parcels), and, ultimately, attractive FCF & shareholder returns. We believe the new 3-year guidance in March 2022 will reflect those dynamics. We increase our EBIT estimates by ~5-7% and move our PT to €75. With unambitious valuation (P/E at 14x), we stick to Buy. ","No quick solution to disrupted supply chains. As the global freight market still lacks containers, port capacity, truck drivers and air freight availability there likely will be no quick fix to the supply chain disruptions that have driven air and ocean freight rates, and gross profits to record highs. At DHL Forwarding, Q3 GP/unit was +20% in Air and +>100% in Ocean vs 2019, and while we do believe rates will start to normalize from next year onwards, this should happen slowly with full normalization not before 2024. DHL Express, which saw volumes supported from volumes being up- traded due to the tightness in the Air Freight market, should also not see an abrupt change in trends. Higher B2C eCommerce volumes prove to be sustainable. In Q3, German parcel volumes continued to grow by +4.6% y/y, although there was no support to B2C volumes from lock- downs anymore, which boosted last year's Q3 parcel volumes by 12% y/y. In DHL Express, B2C eCommerce volumes also continued to grow (+1% y/y), despite last year's stunning 45%. Beyond COVID-19 the story remains highly attractive as well. We believe every segment of the company has an attractive, COVID-19 unrelated story to tell. In P&P, the recent price increases in Mail (+4.6%) and in Parcels (SFe: ~2-3%) provide an additional offset for structural volume declines in Mail. DHL Express, as the main profit engine of the group, continues to benefit from the combination of a highly consolidated global Express market, high operating leverage and structurally growing volumes, especially once B2B eCommerce starts to unfold. DHL Forwarding's self-help story (implementation of new IT environment ""CargoWise""), which had started before COVID-19 and has probably moved off radar screens of investors during COVID-19, has further unfolded, and we think will boost GP/EBIT conversion to largely compensate for the normalization of the rate environment. In Supply Chain Management we see good progress towards the 5% EBIT margin target. And in eCommerce Solution the company moves ahead with strict cost control and yield management. All leading to higher FCF and shareholder returns. The company has concluded its €1bn share buyback program announced at the beginning of the year. Meanwhile, the regular dividend, based on the 40-60% payout ratio, should rise sharply (we estimate €2 for FY-21, up from €1.35 for FY-20). Still, based on our FY-21 FCF estimate of ~€3.8bn, there remains >€1bn in excess cash available for additional shareholder returns. Stick to Buy, PT moves to €75 (€73) Our EBIT estimates are up ~5-7% to €7.84bn in FY-21 and €8.43bn in FY-23 (see p. 3). This moves us ahead of the company's FY-23 target of "">€8bn"" which we regard as conservative given the exposure to structurally growing markets, combined with strong management execution. In March 2022, we expect the company will provide a new three- year guidance framework (2021-24).",Johannes Braun,"Johannes Braun, CFA, CIIA;Marc Zeck, CFA",75,73,Buy,,EUR,4.1,,4.21,,2,2.1,,,,,M,STIFEL_Erratum- Story_CoNote_Nov 08 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Erratum- Story_CoNote_Nov 08 2021 01-00AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=7a02b732-81c6-42a7-83bc-2f7b0dc9ec6d&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
BVI FP,BVI,Nov 23 2021 01:00AM,Bureau Veritas,Business Services,Estimating the cyber-attack's impact ,"Bureau Veritas detected a cyber-attack on Saturday 20th November. Serverswere taken offline, thus slowing down activity and services to clients. Based on Eurofins' precedent, we could expect a double-digit impact on 2021E AOP and EPS. We thus expect a negative share price reaction. Nevertheless, we expect little to no negative impact on 2022/23 estimates, if not upside from insurance compensation. We may learn more next week, during the company's Investor Day on Friday 3rd December. ","What is currently happening: we understand that (only) part of the group's IT systems were affected, but that all servers were shut down to avoid propagation. The group is currently being supported by ‘leading third-party IT experts’ to mitigate these impacts and return to normal. Inspection works can broadly continue, but clients’ online interface are either slow or down. Looking back at the June 2019 cyber-attack on Eurofins: ERF lost -€69m sales in 2019 o/w -€62m in June alone (-1.5% on 2019 revenue, and -5% on Q2-19). And -€75.2m impact on 2019 EBITA (-11%), accounting for lost sales and IT consulting costs net of +€10m insurance compensation in H2-19. ERF then received €10m additional insurance compensation in H1-20, and €20m more in H2-20. Finally, we note that Eurofins faced increasing DSO as the commercial effort was focused on maintaining the client relationships, with less emphasis on receivables collection. What Eurofins' case tells us: (1) A short-term impact: We could expect the negative impact on top line and AOP to be limited to Q4-21 only. (2) Insurance compensation: we could expect 50% of lost AOP (from lost sales and IT intervention/ consulting costs) to be recovered though insurance compensation, o/w 25% within the first 12 months. We would conservatively assume zero compensation in Q4-21. BVI disclosed in its 2020 annual report that it subscribed to a cybersecurity insurance policy, which covers data breaches and cyber terrorism in particular. The Group's insurance policies cover all subsidiaries throughout the world. (3) Headwind on NWC: we would expect BVI to stop any significant effort to collect receivables, and to focus on maintaining a solid client relationship through this crisis. Estimated impacts on BVI's financials, based on a'Eurofins scenario’: we would cut our 2021E sales by -1.5%, AOP by -10%, and EPS by -14.5%. We would leave our 2022/23E revenue unchanged (assuming lost sales are a pure one-off, with limited damages to the group's commercial relationships), and we would lift our 2022/23E AOP by c.3% p.a. to account for expected future insurance compensation. We would also factor in at least +50bps NWC/Sales in 2021E, implying an additional -€25m impact on 2021E FCF, to be recovered in H2-22E. Thus, our 2021E FCF would stand at €288m, down -23% vs. our current estimate.

EVT GY,EVT,Oct 27 2021 02:11AM,Evotec SE,Biotechnology,"""EVO"" listing in the US getting closer ","Yesterday evening, Evotec announced that is has commenced a public offeringin the US of up to 25.3m American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) representing up to 12.65m of its ordinary shares. Pricing of those new shares is expected in the week of Nov 1. The final price of the offered ADSs will be determined largely on the basis of the closing price of Evotec's shares on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on the pricing date. ","If successful, Evotec targets a fresh liquidity inflow of approximately €500m from placing new shares in the US, representing a dilution of up to 7.7% for existing shareholders. With this measure Evotec would improve its already quite comfortable liquidity position even further. As per 30 June 2021, Evotec ‘s liquidity amounted to €449.3m with a net cash position of €79.5m. Thus, the net debt leverage ratio at the end of H1 2021 was a negative c.1.0x based on adj. EBITDA and excl IFRS 16. Evotec intends to use the expected net proceeds from the offering to expand its biologics manufacturing capacity in the United States, build additional J.POD capacity in Toulouse, France, expand its precision medicine platform, accelerate pipeline activities, expand its portfolio of EVOequity investments and the remainder for general corporate purposes. Our overall take: An already earlier announced and expected move by Evotec is finally happening. We believe that a NASDAQ-listing of Evotec shares is the right move for the company given that a large and increasing share of its business is already generated in the US. We keep our Hold rating and €38.50 PT. Our €38.50 price target per Evotec share is derived from a SOTP valuation model using an EBITDA forward multiple (15x to 18x 2030E EV/EBITDA) for the three core businesses EVT Execute, EVT Innovate and Just Evotec Biologics discounted using a discount rate of 9%. The largest value contributor is the disruptive Just Evotec Biologics business (c.45% of our €38.50 price target, using a 18x EV/EBITDA target multiple) while EVT Innovate contributes just c.22% to our total valuation. Both segments offer significantly higher future growth rates as compared with Evotec's largest segment today (EVT Execute), which only contributes c.24% to our combined new price target.

There were no immediate news that would change the perception of the market, in our view. The CMD made clear that u-blox is well positioned to benefit from the strong growth in loT markets in the short- and longer-term. Overall business environment very good — execution is key u-blox has reiterated its guidance for 2021 and also made clear that the order book is 9x higher on pre-Covid levels. When looking at peers/competitors, it becomes clear that the business environment is currently very good. Since the order book is full and there are still supply chain issues, execution for u-blox will be key to benefitting from current strong trends. Being a full service provider could pay off in the mid-term With its full offering of chips, modules and services/software, u-blox has a unique set- up in the market. Security of transported data and cloud connectivity become more important and u-blox can sell those services as add-ons at higher margins. The strategy could pay-off in the mid- to longer term, but it is too early to tell. Short-term business should do well based on strong order book — sustainability unclear as yet As mentioned earlier, the order book is full and demand is still very high driven by the post-Covid recovery in several end-markets. With supply issues easing, u-blox should be able to generate attractive sales growth also in 2022. In our view, the situation around the mid- to longer term growth opportunities for u-blox remain unclear. In the current environment, most companies in the industry benefit from special demand conditions, and it is not yet clear how u-blox will benefit under normalised circumstances.

EVK GY,EVK,Nov 04 2021 02:57AM,Evonik,Chemicals,FCF guidance up and specified for EBITDA ,"Evonik believes it will reach the upper end of the 2021 EBITDA guidance range of EUR2.3-2.4bn and increased FCF guidance to EUR 1bn (previously EUR 950m). The FCF outlook is above consensus of EUR 931m and EBITDA is in line with expectations. Q3 clean EBITDA came in at EUR 645m (Stifel EUR 651m, consensus: EUR 641m), which is +24% y/y and virtually flat q/q, despite EUR -30m one-off effects. Price momentum accelerated +8% in Q3 y/ y after just +2% in Q2. In contrast to the rising momentum in prices, raw material and energy cost inflation are likely to have peaked in Q3 at +450m and started to moderate. FCF was strong at EUR 937m in 9M-21 but will be low in Q4 due to tax payment of EUR 200m and higher capex. ","Nutrition & Care: Health & Care showed a +10% q/q sales increase. LNP deliveries to BioNTech accelerated and contributed to the strong growth. Evonik mentioned +8% price increases for methionine as of September, which should start to come through in Q4 but even more in 2022. EBITDA again improved sequentially and was above expectations despite incremental headwind from bonus provisions and preparation of maintenance. Specialty Additives: After a very strong Q1, EBITDA fell q/q in Q2 and again in Q3 and was below expectations. EBITDA margin was at 24% (Q2: 26%, Q11: 30%). Due to the value pricing, it takes longer to pass through higher raw material costs. However, volume momentum is strong at >+10% y/y and price momentum increased from 3% in Q2 to +7% in Q3. e@ Smart Materials: Demand is strong and earnings were flat q/q against the usual seasonal pattern and start-up costs for the new PA12 plant. The new plant will ramp up in early 2022. Evonik mentions high demand for Silica for tires and High-Performance Polymers, both gaining price momentum. Price increases for silicone products were announced at +30%, as already seen at Wacker. Performance Materials: Margins at butadiene and MTBE improved considerably, holding up well, and EBITDA was flat q/q despite the maintenance shutdown in Marl of EUR 10-20m. The rising oil price should benefit earnings in the coming quarters. e@ Energy: Evonik has hedged gas costs up to 70% for rolling three years. The Energy cost impact was EUR 30m in Q3 and might be EUR 60m in Q4. In total, cost increases might be +35% this year. Energy costs will increase again in 2022, but at a lower pace. e@ Net debt was EUR 2.74bn after EUR 3.17n in Q2. Pensions fell slightly by EUR 201m during the quarter. Q3-21 at a glance Stifel Cons.

Almost 50% of the non-family pool tendered theirshares to the all-cash offer proposed by Faurecia. The latter now owns 79.5% of Hella and ""confirms the execution of identified cost synergies and optimization plan from Day 1 after closing"". The latter is expected early next year (late Jan /early Feb 2022), in our view. ","No squeeze will be sought. Hella should remain a listed company with reduced free- float (20.5%) as the 90% holding threshold has not been reached. Total consideration reduced by €1.4bn. Faurecia should have eventually invested €5.3bn to take control of this asset (for 79.5% instead of the planned €6.7bn for 100%) “allowing (group) higher flexibility"" according to the press release. Whether this implies that the second capital increase (a refinancing bridge to equity of €0.8bn is planned post closing) could be reduced or not, is unclear at this stage. Next steps are last regulatory clearances before closing early 2022... Transaction is of course subject to regulatory approvals (US, Brazil, Russia, Turkey have cleared the operation; EU is still pending, but no major concerns have been identified). We understand that closing could happen as soon as late January/early February 2022. Synergies of c. €750m. As a reminder, on a five-year horizon, contemplated synergies from the deal should be in the magnitude of 3/4th of a billion, combining P&L and non-P&L components, through :1/ increased revenues (up to €400m on techno sharing and regional complementarities), 2/ cost savings (at least €200m 5-10% of which already in 2022; a cumulated 80% achieved in the first 4 years), and 3/ €200m through better FCF generation (Capex and WCR components optimisation). Previous significant events and time-line of the announced Business Combination Agreement 14 August 2021: Faurecia announced the agreement with the controlling family Hueck/Ropcke to acquire their 60% stake in Hella and jointly announced its intention to launch a public tender offer on the remaining fraction (40%). 27 September 2021: Faurecia launched its public takeover offer for Hella at a price of €60 in cash per share post regular dividend payment of €0.96/share or a total consideration of €60.96/share. Since Faurecia already reached an agreement with the Family pool owning the majority, and given the legal nature of the acquired entity (a ""KGaA"" which is akin to a ""Limited Partnership"" in the US/UK or a ""commandite par actions"" in France), a domination agreement was not required as Faurecia ""now controls management and FCF"".

SGO FP,SGO,Dec 14 2021 01:00AM,Compagnie de Saint Gobain,Building Materials,"Fireside Chat Feedback: On Track, But Delivery Still Key ","We held a fireside chat with the Saint Gobain CFO late Friday afternoon. The messagewas clear. The Group is fired up and on track when it comes to strategic change. Its high exposure to Europe and sustainability should be a supportive backdrop during this journey over the next few years. The Group now has very clear targets when it comes to margins, cash generation and returns. In that sense, delivery is key, especially with a view to its latest acquisitions. Looking at near-term matters, it appears as if pricing trends and discipline still point in the right direction. Trading updates from other companies in the sector also point to continued volume support. That being said, industrial momentum is slowing, while the automotive side struggles to recover. Also, the latest Google Trends for renovation, DIY and flights in France all point south for December. We like what we see in terms of the value on offer and the European/ sustainability angle. That being said, timing remains a challenge for us. ","Strategic change continues apace, but delivery remains key. It is obvious management is fired up to change the underlying culture of the Group to one of accountability and delivery. The country manager organisation is meant to bring the Group closer to the client. Underperforming businesses are given time, but ultimately will have to be sold, if they don't deliver the returns. At the end of the day, it is those returns by which the Group is going to be measured by. To deliver a ROCE at the top end of the 12-15% pre-tax range would imply an EBIT range of €4.65bn, which is +5-6% higher than 21E consensus (at €4.4bn). That should be possible. That said, when looking at the newly acquired construction chemicals businesses, we get to invested capital of ~€6.1bn (Chryso, GCP and Maxit making up €1bn, €2bn and €2.1bn respectively, while we estimate the Weber heritage business to have ~€1bn of invested capital). So far we expect these businesses to deliver €4.4bn of sales, an EBIT margin of 14.4% and a ROCE of 10.5% by 2024 (see Figure 10). This is still short of the Group's target range. In short, the Group has got its work cut out to achieve its return targets at least for the construction chemicals platform for the 2021-2025 period. Europe and sustainability provide the backdrop for this change story. With some 72% sales exposure to Europe (of which 27% to France), the Group is one of the most European-biased groups in our universe. The continent and especially France is still some way below the REAL pre-GFC (see Figure 8). So, with EU's Next Generation Recovery Plan under way focused on sustainability, we agree with management and see this as a long-term trend actually favouring the Group. Near-term trends appear to remain intact with some caveats. The all-important price cost spread should remain positive for the full-year, although H2-21 may have turned negative. That being said, the Group is on the front foot when it comes to pricing. Trends seen in Q3-21 and October should still play out today. The Group actively pushes its pricing power on an ongoing basis. Also, when reading trading updates such as the one from Volution (not covered) until the end of Nov-21 then volumes should have remained supportive. The order book in renovation is strong. That being said, we have seen a noticeable drop in Google Searches for renovation, DIY and flights in France in early Dec-21 (see Figure 4). Whether this is due to the omicron virus remains to be seen. Industrial demand has been getting sequentially better, with only the ceramics capex spending remaining weaker. The one area of weakness remains the automotive side in Europe, which struggles to recover (see Figure 6). Still a value stock, with potential for a re-rating. Saint Gobain only last Dec-20 was still in the 'sin-bin' with other more polluting industries and value stocks (including cement, see Figure 3). This did not make sense given the Group's sustainability characteristics. Since then, however, the stock has started to correlate positively with the CO2 price (which wasn't the case before). Much more should, in theory, be possible given that 72% of Group sales are said to be related to sustainability according to the Group. At 6x 22E EV/EBITDA the stock trades just below its thirty-year median of 6.1x, but remains attractive value. Its EV/ CE at 1.14x 22E compares to the 2007 peak at 1.4x, the last time the post-tax ROCE was above 11% (see Figure 9).",Tobias Woerner,Tobias Woerner,63,,Hold,,EUR,5.14,,5.3,,2.05,2.12,,,,,M,STIFEL_Fireside Chat_FlashCoNote_Dec 14 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Fireside Chat_FlashCoNote_Dec 14 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=3a20385b-7f39-4399-89c0-7e94c85a3f0f&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

ARBN SW,ARBN,Oct 26 2021 02:46AM,Arbonia AG,Construction Supplier,First look at supportive CMD news ,"Ahead of today's CMD in Plattling / Germany, Arbonia already published new 2026mid-term targets which should be taken positively by the market. Management is now looking for a stronger top-line growth (>5% p.a. pushed by good markets and more structurally growing products such as the new energy storage system) and an EBITDA of around CHF 200m (11% above SFe). The projected annual dividend increase from 10% to 15% p.a. nicely indicates that the launch of its upcoming growth initiatives will not consume overly high investments. Furthermore, the company also mentioned its progress in terms of ESG with more quantitative and qualitative targets. ","Current trading environment: It seems as though the company is continuing to grow nicely and that it is in a position to implement various price increases in order to compensate for the known market headwinds such as rising input costs. Despite selective supply bottlenecks, we believe the company is firmly on track to (at least) reach full-year targets. New mid-term targets / Sales: For the period 2021-2026E management is now looking for an organic increase of >5% p.a. which compares to only 3%+ level in the past. We see the rise driven by a combination of ongoing strong (subsidised) end markets as well as the benefit from new product launches (e.g. energy storage system) / expansions (heat pumps). New mid-term targets / Profitability: In comparison to its former targets the company also became more positive on group profitability, mainly driven by the doors business which is progressing well. Overall, management is now looking for an EBITDA of CHF 200m in 2026E which implies a theoretical 11% upside potential to our estimates of CHF 181m. No consensus data are available at this point of time. FCF figures set to improve gradually: Following the implementation of the current investment programme, which has only been slightly increased despite its new product initiatives, capex levels are targeted to move towards a much lower 4-5% range by 2025E.",Tobias Fahrenholz,Tobias Fahrenholz,21,,Buy,,CHF,0.85,,0.96,,0.28,0.31,,,,,M,STIFEL_First look_FlashCoNote_Oct 26 2021 02-46AM.pdf,STIFEL_First look_FlashCoNote_Oct 26 2021 02-46AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=b0a819f1-1292-44ab-a451-85990d973d10&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
BOSN SW,BOSN,Oct 27 2021 02:15AM,Bossard,Capital Goods,First look at new long-term targets ,"Ahead of today's first ever CMD in Zug (Switzerland), Bossard has published ashort press release related to its new long-term Strategy 200, which is basically linked to its 200-year anniversary in FY-31. Few details are given but the company has slightly increased its organic growth target to >5% p.a. and the mid-term EBIT margin target range from 10-13% to 12-15%, after an initial phase of investments. ","Upgraded long-term growth targets out: Looking at Bossard's former mid-term targets, the company was generally looking for 7-9% sales growth (o/w roughly 2/3 organic growth + 1/3 M&A). Management is now sticking to its typically value-accretive M&A ambitions while targeting a slightly higher organic growth rate of >5%. This increased level basically meets our expectations and should be pushed by a generally increased focus on supply-chain management, an increased automation / service offering and potentially further regional expansion too. EBIT margin target also up, after initial investments: Management has so far been looking for a market-leading EBIT margin range of 10-13%. Speaking about the mid- term and initial investments (most likely for IT & personnel), it is now forecasting a highly attractive 12-15%. Here, we would initially rather have expected a range of 11-14% (our long-term EBIT margin is already looking for 13.5%). Potential impact on consensus forecasts: The market still has to implement the recent margin-accretive M&A deal (Jeveka with annual revenue of around CHF 29m). Otherwise, we stick to our view that consensus profit forecasts are potentially slightly elevated in FY-22 while offering further upgrade potential in the longer run. Agenda: CMD start at 1pm CEST / location: headquarters in Zug, Switzerland / topics: business opportunities & Strategy 200 + deep dive into Bossard's value proposition (smart factory logistics, assembly technology expert, smart factory assembly).",Tobias Fahrenholz,Tobias Fahrenholz,320,,Buy,,CHF,12.7,,12.6,,4.8,5,,,,,M,STIFEL_First look_FlashCoNote_Oct 27 2021 02-15AM.pdf,STIFEL_First look_FlashCoNote_Oct 27 2021 02-15AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=71a29a5a-cf57-4358-9cb0-d2dc7e904f13&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
PA8 GR,PA8,Nov 10 2021 05:03AM,PAION AG,Biotechnology,"First product sales and royalties coming in, FY 2021 guidance confirmed ","Paion published its 9M 2021 financial report today, which we rate overall very solid.Paion is making good progress on revenues from first product sales and royalties from partners (€2.9m vs zero a year ago). Licensing and milestone income amounted to €2.6m (was €19.3m in 9M 2020 due to larger milestone payments for product approvals in larger markets last year). In total, group revenues came in at €5.5m after 9M 2021 and management confirmed its FY 2021 revenue guidance of €8.0m to €9.5m (Stifel estimate €8.6m). We keep our Buy rating and €4.15 price target on Paion AG shares. Please also see our initiation report on Paion for further details. ","First product sales start coming in, primarily from Asia In 9M 2021 Paion generated first revenues from product sales and royalties from partners of €2.9m with particularly good progress in China, Japan and South Korea, where Paion has licensed its proprietary and novel rapid onset/offset procedural sedative and anaesthesia product Byfavo to partners. Paion launched Byfavo in the UK in August 2021 and signed an exclusive collaboration agreement with Clinigen for the supply and distribution of its products into the UK in September 2021. Also in September 2021, Paion launched Byfavo in the Netherlands. The rollout of all three products (including two in-licensed products from La Jolla Pharmaceutical) across Europe is well on track and should be concluded in most European countries by the end of 2022E. US Byfavo launch on track, good news from the regulatory front For the US market, Paion licensed Byfavo to Acacia Pharma for the indication procedural sedation. Acacia has so far reported solid progresson of its launch activities since the market introduction in January 2021, despite pandemic-related restricitions. By the end of September, Byfavo had been put on formulary in 95 accounts in the US (i.e., it is on the purchasing list of a hospital, but the anaesthesist still has to choose Byfavo from that list) with a >90% win rate, on track to reach its 150 accounts target by year-end. For the indication general anaesthesia, the licence agreement with Cosmo/Acacia originally provided for an option for the US rights to develop and commercialise Byfavo. As this option was not exercised by the licensee, it has lapsed. An advisory meeting was recently held with the FDA on suitability of the European clinical programme for filing of a New Drug Application (NDA) in the US. As a positive outcome of the Type B meeting, the FDA stated that a submission would be possible with the current data package consisting of European and Asian general anaesthesia data. PAION will now use the outcome of the meeting to intensify the discussion with interested parties for the general anaesthesia licence in the US on top of its established procedural sedation licence to Acacia Pharma.

LDO IM,LDO,Nov 05 2021 02:00AM,Leonardo SpA,Aerospace & Defence,First Take on Q3-21 Results ,"Our initial view, pre-call, is that Leonardo's Q3-21 results are fine overall. It postedEBITA which hit consensus, a wide Free Operating Cashflow (""FOCF"") beat, and unchanged guidance that still appears to us to be realistic, and which is in-line with consensus. Its Aerostructures loss was insignificantly lower, despite much lower 787 shipset deliveries, and Leonardo now expects breakeven by the end of 2025 (it is unclear whether this is EBITA or FOCF, or whether any production rate increases are factored in). There were no new indications on the timing of the postponed IPO of DRS, its US defence electronics business, or of other disposals. We re-iterate our Buy recommendation and €10.50 PT. ","e@ Expected move in consensus estimates: Flat for FY-21. Expected stock price reaction: Up roughly 2%. Q3-21 figures: EBITA hit consensus, cashflow beat widely... After the close yesterday on Thursday 4 November, Leonardo reported 9M-21 Results. We focus here on the new news, which is the Q3-21 figures. In Q3-21, its key metric of EBITA of €207m (implying a 6.4% margin) hit company-compiled consensus of €207m, though it was 6% below our more-optimistic estimate of €219m. Revenue of €3,219m (up 2% y/y) was closely in-line vs consensus and our estimate. Reported EPS of €0.09 (down 33% y/y) was well above consensus of €0.06 and our similar estimate of €0.05 (benefiting from lower below-the-line expenses and a very low tax rate). FOCF of €-7m was well above consensus of €-210m and our estimate of €-291m. New orders beat consensus by 3%, leaving Q3-21 book-to-bill at 0.80x. FY-21 guidance was unchanged... Leonardo kept its prior guidance for new orders of ~€14bn, revenues of €13.8-14.3bn, EBITA of €1,075-1,125m, FOCF of ~€100m and Net Debt of ~€3.2bn. This is at a mean €/$ spot rate of $1.18. ....Which is mostly in-line with consensus... The mid-point of its EBITA guidance of €1,100m is closely in-line with company-compiled consensus of €1,106m, as is the mid-point of the revenue guidance (€14,050m vs cons. of €14,143m). The FOCF guidance of ~€100m is slightly below consensus of €114m (although this delta represents merely 0.1% of guided revenues). We note that in 9M-21 alone, EBITA was €607m (so the mid-point of the guidance implies €493m in Q4-21, which compares to €441m achieved in Q4-20), and 9M-21 FCF was €-1,387m (so the guidance implies €1,487m in Q4-21 vs €2,636m achieved in Q4-20). Other key points. The Aerostructures business (6% of FY-20 group revenue) saw €-43m loss in Q3-21, which was in-line with Q2-21 (€-36m) and Q1 (€-46m), despite significantly lower 787 programme shipset deliveries. Leonardo announced that FY-21 ""will be the bottom year, with a gradual recovery and then breakeven point expected by the end of 2025"". Prior to COVID, EBITA breakeven was expected in 2021 or 2022, with FCF breakeven one year later. Our modelling assumption has been breakeven in FY-25. ATR, its regional turboprop JV, nearly halved its loss sequentially again to €-4m in Q3-21 (vs €-7m in Q2-21 and €-14m in Q1-21). There was nothing new in the press release about the DRS IPO process.

AIR FP,AIR,Oct 28 2021 01:55AM,Airbus,Aerospace & Defence,First Take on Q3-21 Results ,"Our initial view, pre-call, is that Airbus’s Q3-21 results are good overall. Theyfeatured a 7% “EBIT Adjusted” beat vs consensus, driven by Eliminations and margins at Helicopters and Commercial Aircraft, raised guidance to a level that whilst it is only in-line for EBIT and 9% below for FCF, still appears to us to be conservative, and delivered a moderate FCF beat in the quarter. In our view, it shows the benefit of good cost control and richening mix (more A320neo Family narrow-bodies), as well as Airbus' continued caution as to pacing of deliveries and rising costs in FY-21. We reiterate our Buy recommendation. ","Expected move in consensus EBIT estimates: Up roughly 3% for FY-21. Expected stock price reaction: Up roughly 2%. Q3-21 figures: EBIT beat consensus by 7%... A little earlier, Airbus reported 9M-21 Results. We focus here on the new news, which is the Q3-21 figures. In Q3-21, Airbus's key metric of ""EBIT Adjusted"" was €666m, implying a 6.3% margin (or 7% above/below company-compiled consensus of €623m, and closely in-line vs our more optimistic estimate of €663m). Revenue of €10,518m (down 6% y/y, mainly due to 12% fewer deliveries) was 1% below consensus and 4% below our estimate. ""EPS Adjusted"" of €0.58 (down 16% y/y) was 12% above consensus and 15% above our estimate. ""Free Cashflow before M&A and Customer Financing"" was €209m (moderately above consensus of €-59m and modestly above our more optimistic estimate of €81m). Please see tables on the next page for details of key group figures and segmental analysis. ...Driven by Eliminations, plus margins at Helicopters and Commercial Aircraft... The “EBIT Adjusted” beat vs. consensus was driven by the erratic Eliminations line (€+32m vs consensus of €-10m), by margins at Helicopters (of 8.5%, +130bp above consensus of 7.2%, seemingly due to operating leverage, aftermarket mix and lower R&D), and by margins at Commercial Aircraft (of 6.6%, or +30bp above consensus of 6.3%, seemingly due to good cost control). FY-21 guidance was raised... Airbus kept guidance of 600 commercial aircraft deliveries, but it increased guidance for ""EBIT Adjusted"" to €4.5bn (up 13% vs the prior guidance of ""Around €4bn""), and for “FCF before M&A and Customer Financing” to €2.5bn (up 25% prior guidance of ""Around €2bn""). We note that in 9M-21 alone, ""EBIT Adjusted"" was €3,369m (so the guidance implies just €1,131m, or 25% of it, to achieve in Q4-21), and FCF was €2,260m (so the guidance implies just €240m, or 10% of it, to achieve in Q4-21). ...Which is in-line vs consensus for EBIT, though still below for FCF. The new ""EBIT Adjusted"" guidance is 1% above current Visible Alpha consensus (of contributions in the last 30 days only) of €4,492m, unchanged deliveries guidance is 3% below consensus of 618, and below implied production, by our estimates, of ~627. The FCF guidance is 9% below consensus of €2,840m, but, given that it implies very low Q4-21 FCF, which is seasonally usually its strongest FCF quarter, despite positive EBIT, it looks quite conservative, in our view, given the balance of likely improving Pre-Delivery Payment flows, and likely higher Q4 vs Q3 deliveries, partly offset by possibly higher inventories to prepare for production rate increases. Other points. Airbus announced a production rate increase on the A330 to ""Almost 3"" aircraft per month at the end of 2022, and slightly delayed the timing of the previously- announced rate increase on the A350 to 6 per month to ""early 2023"", vs ""By Autumn 2022"" previously.

SAF FP,SAF,Oct 29 2021 02:12AM,Safran,Aerospace & Defence,First Take on Q3-21 Revenues ,"Our initial view is that Safran's Q3-21 revenues are fine overall. They featuredin-line revenues, raised FCF guidance and broadly in-line aftermarket revenue growth. We look for more indications on the call about Q4 lead indicators for engine shop visits and the pacing of aftermarket improvement. We continue to expect a domestic market, narrow-body-skewed global traffic recovery to take hold, which should drive an aftermarket acceleration for Safran in Q4-21. Hence, we reiterate our Buy rating and recommend buying on any weakness. ","Expected move in consensus EBIT estimates: Flat for FY-21. Expected stock price reaction: Up 1%. Q3-21 revenue in line... Earlier this morning, Safran reported Q3-21 revenue. Group ""Adjusted revenue"" of €3,734m was closely in line with consensus (provided by the Company) of €3,719 and our matching estimate of €3,719m. Its key aftermarket metric, Propulsion segment Civil Aerospace AM revenues in $ terms, rose by +43.8% y/y in Q3-21, which was 100bp below consensus of +45% and 600bp above our more conservative +39% estimate, and it sustained an improving trend vs +25% in Q2-21, -53% in Q1-21, -47% in Q4-20, and -56% in Q3-20. ...within this, segmental estimates were closely in line too. At a segmental level, Propulsion and Equipment were both closely in line, with Aircraft Interiors (12% of group FY-20 revenue) being +1.6% above consensus. FY-21 guidance was raised for FCF... Safran kept existing guidance for a low-single- digit organic decline in revenue and a high-single-digit decline at a EUR/USD spot FX rate of $1.22, and for ""Adjusted Recurring Operating Margin"" to increase ""Above 100bps"", implying >11.2%, but it increased its Free Cashflow guidance to >€1.5bn (vs prior guidance of ""Above 2020 level"", implying >€1,073m), due to downpayments on export contracts for Rafale (which we estimate to be ~€200m for both Egypt (30 more aircraft) and Greece (6 more aircraft)), and better working capital. LEAP engine deliveries are now expected to be ~900, vs 800+ previously. ...which is <5% below consensus for EBIT, and >17% above for FCF. The implied EBIT guidance of roughly >€1,700m is <5% below current Company-compiled consensus of €1,787m). The revised FCF guidance of >€1.5bn is >17% above current consensus of €1,278m. Other key points. Safran commented that as of 17 October 2021, weekly flight cycles for the CFM56 engine fleet (which are its most important current aftermarket driver) were -31% below the same week in 2019 (vs -35% as at 18 July 2021), and for the LEAP engine fleet, they were +105% above the same week in 2019 (vs +101% as at 18 July 2021).

They featureda 4% “EBIT adjusted” beat vs consensus, mainly driven by OEM segment margins, raised EBIT and free cashflow (FCF) guidance (it is still 1% below consensus EBIT, though well above on FCF), plus a small FCF beat in the quarter. In our view, OEM margin was particularly impressive, and overall, it is a small positive for our investment thesis, and while Commercial MRO was slightly disappointing in Q3, we incline to see this as mix-related, with non-GTF MRO to pick up more going forward. We reiterate our Buy recommendation. ","Expected move in consensus EBIT estimates: Up roughly 2% for FY-21. Expected stock price reaction: Up 2%. Q3-21 figures: EBIT beat consensus by 4% ... A little earlier this morning, MTU reported 9M-21 Results. We focus here on the new news, which is the Q3-21 figures. In Q3-21, MTU's key metric of ""EBIT adjusted"" was €117m, implying an 11.7% margin (or 4% above company-compiled consensus of €113m, although 4% below our more optimistic estimate of €122m). Revenue of €1,004m (up +11% y/y) was 5% below consensus and 2% below our more-conservative estimate. ""EPS adjusted"" of €1.59 (up 46% y/y) was +8% above consensus, although 4% below our more- conservative estimate. Free cashflow as defined by MTU (FCF) was €18m (slightly above consensus of €15m, although modestly below our more optimistic estimate of €26m). Please see tables on the next page for details of key group figures and segmental analysis. ... driven by OEM Segment margins. The “EBIT adjusted” beat vs. consensus was mainly driven by OEM Segment margins (of 23.8%, +350bp above consensus of 20.3%), seemingly due to mix (although OE revenue grew at ~20% compared with ""low teens"" for Spares revenue). This was partly offset by Commercial MRO segment margins (of 4.3%, -60bp below consensus of 4.9%, due to mix, with a higher % of Geared Turbofan (GTF) shop visits), and by revenue misses at Commercial OEM (-5% below consensus) and Commercial MRO (4% below consensus). FY-21 EBIT and cashflow guidance was raised ... MTU adjusted guidance to €4.3bn to €4.4bn of revenue (vs €4.3bn to €4.5bn previously, so the mid-point reduced by 1%, due to lower MRO material content at Commercial MRO and lower Military OEM growth), 10.5% ""EBIT adjusted"" margins (vs 10.0% to 10.5% previously, so a +25bp increase at the mid-point), ""net income adjusted"" growth ""in line with EBIT adjusted"", and a Cash Conversion Rate (FCF divided by “net income adjusted”) of ""high double digit"" (vs in the “mid- to high double-digit range” previously). This implies ""EBIT adjusted"" of €457m at the mid-point. We note that in 9M-21, ""EBIT adjusted"" was €307m (so the guidance implies just €150m in Q4-21). ... which is slightly below vs consensus for EBIT, though well above for FCF. The mid-point of the new ""EBIT adjusted"" guidance of €457m is 1% below current company-compiled consensus of €462m, and the implied FCF guidance, assuming that ""high double digit"" equates to ~75%, implies ~€243m, which is 35% above consensus of €180m, but, given that it implies low Q4-21 FCF of very roughly €38m (after FCF of €205m in 9M-21), despite positive EBIT, it looks quite conservative, in our view, given likely higher Q4 vs Q3 engine shop visits and aftermarket, partly offset by possibly higher inventories to prepare for production rate increases. e@ Conference call details. 11.00am CEST: +49 069 2443 7403 (Germany), +44 0800 694 1461 (UK) and +1 866 280 1157 (US), using the confirmation code: 4925609.",Harry Breach,Harry Breach,230,,Buy,,EUR,6.2,,8.3,,2,2.5,,,,,M,STIFEL_First Take_FlashCoNote_Oct 29 2021 04-35AM.pdf,STIFEL_First Take_FlashCoNote_Oct 29 2021 04-35AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=39ce45cb-8bae-4573-bb64-b2e56bcf0068&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
CRH ID,CRH,Dec 07 2021 11:12AM,CRH PLC,Construction,Focusing Its Resources ,"CRH is apparently evaluating the divestment of its U.S. Building Envelopebusiness for more than USD3bn or >10x EV/EBITDA, according to Bloomberg. We would very much like such a deal, as it would refocus the Group around the heavy-side and related products. We also believe that such a divestment might actually get a higher price as long as the base EBITDA assumption is correct, there are synergies on the table and the non-residential side recovers into 2022. The suggested valuation would be significantly ahead of CRH's rating, which should increase the potential valuation upside. We think this is good news and should now finally drive the stock towards the €50 mark we have talked about for a while. ","Peer and transaction multiples point to double-digit EV/EBITDA multiples. Apogee (not rated), one of its U.S- listed peers, is trading on 10x 22E (Feb Y/E on Bloomberg consensus estimates), while CRH bought C.R. Laurence Co., Inc. for 11.3x in 2015. We believe that there should be some good interest from private equity and trade buyers. Another potential alternative would be to merge this business with Apogee in exchange for shares. The potential valuation of such a divestment would compare to CRH’s valuation at 8.3x 22E (pre IFRS16). The obvious question is what is CRH going to do with the cash? At ~0.6x 22E ND/EBITDA (pre IFRS16) the balance sheet is already very strong. We suspect the Group is biding its time waiting for the right opportunity, while it continues to buy back shares and possibly pay a higher, rebased dividend again. After all, it is a dividend aristocrat, which has hardly disappointed over the years. The company is a long-term performer with a significant dividend track record going back to its formation in 1970. The Group last cut its dividend in 1983 and since then has delivered 37 consecutive years of stable or increasing dividends (31 of which were increases). We believe dividend aristocrats may soon make a comeback, especially once overvalued growth stocks face higher discount rates.

JEN GY,JEN,Dec 06 2021 01:03AM,Jenoptik,Industrials,Fresh start into 2022: sale of VINCORION and resegmentation focus business ,"Following Jenoptik's CMD we adjust our model for the VINCORION sale and theDecember consolidation of Berlin Glas Medical / SwissOptic. e We also account for the reorientation of the segments and the carve-out of the Automation business into a separate 'segment'. e Accordingly, we tune our valuation so as to focus on the reorientation and make a sum of the parts for Photonics and Automation. e Following the value-accretive strategy, but also considering the muted growth and margin outlook, we raise slightly our price target to €35.00 (from €34.00) and reiterate our Hold rating. ","VINCORION sale is headwind to estimates, but positive for valuation We welcome the VINCORION sale, as it leaves Jenoptik with a more focused group that has clear addressable markets and technologies. Therefore, we see the sale as a clear plus for valuation, especially if the concentration on the former Light & Optics business and new Advanced Photonice Solutions intensifies. Nevertheless, the €150m GDP plus growing revenue leave a hole in Jenoptik's P&L going forward. Importantly, there is no impact on 2021E and M9 2022E adj. EPS since the contribution of VINCORION positively impacts the financial result of Jenoptik in both periods. Therefore, we assume a divestment towards the end of Q3 2022E. We depict the changes due to the VINCORION sale as well as the resegmentation in Table 1 on page 4. December integration of Berlin Glas Medical and resegmentation have limited impact on our estimates, post VINCORION divestment The consolidation of Berlin Glas Medical and SwissOptic as of 1 December has a minor effect on our estimates, increasing both revenue and EBITDA by 1.3%, as we initially anticipated a consolidation beginning January 2022. Additionally, we haven't changed our estimates much going forward. Only due to the limited outlook for organic growth in the Smart Mobility Solutions segment, we slightly adjust our growth assumption from 4% to 3%. As a reminder, this is the business where future M&A will play a major role, according to the CMD. We continue to believe that in general higher growth rates, first and foremost in the Advanced Photonics segment, are possible. On the other hand, for understandable reasons, we do net yet include the M&A potential from bolt-ons and bigger acquisitions in Smart Mobility in our estimates. We deem the additional potential from such acquisitions in the low to mid € area regarding Jenoptik's share price, if management can keep its track record regarding attractive targets and integration. Hold rating reiterated and increased price target of €35.00 (was €34.00) We use a 50:50 mix of DCF analysis and peer group multiples to derive our €35.00 price target. In our DCF analysis we derive a €40.00 implied equity value with a beta of 1.2, 2% terminal growth rate and a 7.5% WACC. The 14.8x EV/EBIT multiple for 2022E results in a €29.00 implied equity value. Main downside risks to our Hold rating are technology and price competition. Main upside risks to our investment case are pronounced above- market growth rates and material M&A activity.",Florian Pfeilschifter,Florian Pfeilschifter,35,34,Hold,,EUR,1.57,,1.59,,0.39,0.4,,,,,M,STIFEL_Fresh start_CoNote_Dec 06 2021 01-03AM.pdf,STIFEL_Fresh start_CoNote_Dec 06 2021 01-03AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=c498a45a-5bda-4f6a-aed3-6118f15a84d8&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
LOGN SW,LOGN,Oct 26 2021 01:55AM,Logitech,Technology Hardware,Full-year guidance not raised as supply chain issues start to hurt ,"LOGN has announced FQ2 results with another beat in sales and non-GAAP earningsof 4%/7% vs. consensus but we were looking at slightly higher estimates. Details are shown in the table below. Full-year guidance (FY ending in March 2022) is confirmed (flat sales with a non-GAAP profit of US$800-850m) with the exception of cash flow from operations that is now seen lower at 0.5x non-GAAP EBIT on inventory build. We do not expect significant changes to consensus EPS estimates for FY21/22. Some investors expected an increase in full-year profit guidance, given the strong positive seasonality of LOGN's business in H2 but supply chain issues are now starting to hit LOGN too. We leave our Hold rating unchanged despite the recent share price decline as risks to sustainability in demand for PC peripherals remain high, post the WFH spending boom. ","Q2 results slightly ahead of consensus: Q2 sales of US$1.3bn (+2% Y/Y in constant currency) are 4% above consensus (Bloomberg) at US$1.26bn. Non-GAAP EBIT of US$211m is 7% ahead of expectations (US$197m). The consensus figure looks low to us, as maybe it is a mixture of reported and adjusted profits. We were looking at US$238m. Growth continued in the larger PC peripherals segments (mice +10%, keyboards +15%) while others were down (webcams -9%, tablet accessories -3%). Video declined 4% Y/Y (constant currency) in Q2 after +72% in Q1, raising questions about future growth. Gaming decelerated its growth in Q2 with +9% vs. +76% in Q1. Growth at the group level decreased to +2%, down from +58% in Q1. Cash flow from operations was again negative US$63m as LOGN kept inventory high which rose further to US$828m end of Sep vs. US$779m end of June (+6%). Peers (i.e., Corsair) suffered supply chain constraints in the Sep-Q but LOGN seems to execute better than others as its sell-through growth was 15% Y/Y. Guidance confirmed for FY 21/22 — cash flow lower due to inventory build: For FY 2022 (ending March) LOGN still sees flat sales (+/-5%) with a non-GAAP profit of US$800-850m. Consensus estimate: US$5.3bn/830m, Stifel estimate: US $5.3bn/913m. Cash flow from operations is now seen at 0.5x non-GAAP profits instead of 1x as the company continues to invest in the supply chain. Sustainability of growth in PC peripherals remains in question: Our research suggests that high demand for PC peripherals (44% of group sales) will not be sustained into CY2022, making the shares exposed to a further de-rating once growth rates turn negative in a meaningful manner.

Growth in renewables in the short and medium-term is supported by a massive project pipeline. e Enel's management detailed for the first time the strategic hedge in the medium- term from integrating a large customer base with growing renewable capacity. e@ We confirm our Buy rating on the stock. Enel's new business plan reinforced our view that the company's value creation linked to energy transition is only partially priced-in by the current share price. ,"Capex acceleration and more visible targets in Enel's 2021-24 business plan In its new business plan for the period 2021-24, Enel further accelerated investments linked to energy transition. The 3-year capex plan has been increased by 12% to €45bn. Targets for both installations of new renewable capacity and investments in electricity distribution networks have been increased. New EBITDA and net profit targets are more consistent with the current scenario. We think that the reduction of EBITDA and net profit targets for 2022 and 2023 improved visibility on growth over the coming years. Growth in renewables is supported by a massive pipeline Renewable capacity is expected to grow by 23GW in 2024 versus 2021, reaching 77GW. 11GW are already in execution. Total mature pipeline amounts to 98GW, more than 4x the 2024 target. In 2030, renewable power generation capacity is expected to reach 154GW. Growth will be supported by a massive 371GW project pipeline. Enel's management reinforced our view on the medium-term strategic hedge from integration of the large customer base with growth in renewables For the first time, Enel's management provided details on the strategic hedge in energy transition from integrating its massive customer base with increasing renewable power generation capacity. Enel expects margin expansion from: 1) sharply increasing electricity volumes sold; 2) reduction in the average cost of power production due to expansion of renewable capacity; 3) increasing contribution to margins from value-added services. Enel's stance reinforced our view on the medium-term benefits of clients/ renewables integration for a global power company like Enel, even if we find it difficult at the moment quantifying the possible impact on margins in 2030. Value creation potential from energy transition is only partially priced-in. We confirm our Buy rating on the stock. Enel's new business plan reinforced our view that the company's value creation linked to energy transition is only partially priced-in by the current share price. The view expressed by Enel's management on the benefits on margins in the medium-term from integrating its large customer base and growing renewable power capacity also confirmed our opinion that a global integrated utility with strong investment potential like Enel is a low-risk way for investors to play energy transition opportunities. We expect that new EBITDA targets more consistent with the current scenario would improve investors’ confidence. We confirm our Buy rating on the stock.

This follows the €40m to €60m (SFe) order Manz received from BMW in early November. We believe the momentum should pick-up further over the upcoming months according to recent management comments and CMD feedback. We believe ACC, Northvolt, and VW, further large scale producers might follow suit with decisions on battery production ramp-up over the coming months. Backed by the high- quality orders from BMW and now Britishvolt, we believe Manz has a good chance to further gain from that development. Furthermore, we believe the order boosts confidence in management credibility going forward. We see our investment case fully supported and reiterate our Buy recommendation. ","e@ While not certain, we and Manz believe that chances are high that the company will play a major role in the ramp-up beyond the initial 4GWh equipment order Manz received on Tuesday 21 December. This could lead to a further order potential of up to over €1.5bn, depending obviously on final configuration. We believe that the split between 2022E and 2023E will be around 60:40 and combined with the other orders Manz has received so far is well aligned with our estimates for the respective years. Hence, Manz currently sees the momentum and ramp-up we model in Energy Storage. e@ We do not believe that Tuesday's order will lead to an extended increase in consensus estimates for 2022E and 2023E; however, we do believe it should boost confidence in the company, as well as its technology and management.

On a group level, sales volumes came in at 2,191,572 tonnes (vs 2,187,600 from consensus and 2,176,377 Stifel) - a growth of +4.6%, outpacing the chocolate market (+1.8% Nielsen data). The result was driven by a continued recovery in Food Manufacturing (+6% y/y) and G&S (+36.6% y/y) in Q4, both benefiting from a low base. For the full year, both divisions are above FY-18/19 levels in terms of volume and we expect this business trend to continue. In G&S, a continuation of recovery in the HoReCa sector - a sector that still operates considerably below 2019 capacity - should help to increase sales volumes significantly, in our view. In Cocoa Products, volume remained under FY-18/19 and FY-19/20 levels (-2.6% y/y), reflecting BARN's focus on higher-margin volume. As expected by us, the company did not give specified FY-21/22 guidance, but reiterated its mid-term targets (5-7% volume growth and EBIT growth beyond that until FY-22/23), which should imply growth acceleration in the coming two years. ","Geographic view: EMEA volume grew 5.5% y/y driven by Eastern Europe Food Manufacturing clients. Reviving mobility in H2 supported mid-teen growth in G&S. EBIT growth of +27.9% in LC.

Net debt stood at £0.9bn at the end of September, down from £2.0bn at the end of of Q3 thanks to the £1.2bn capital increase. Liquidity stands at £4.4bn at the end of September. Outlook & trends No profit or cash burn guidance at this stage. The company says it is too early to say what impact Omicron may have on travel demand. Q1 (Oct-Dec) capacity is adjusted to 65% of FY-19 levels (was: ""up to 70%""). For Q2 the company expects 70% and ""close to"" pre-pandemic levels in Q4. Trading has been solid with bookings in H1-22 ahead of FY-19 levels. Clearly, this was pre the emergence of the Omicron virus variant and pre the renewed UK travel restrictions (all UK travellers to self isolate for one day and take a PCR test on the second). e@ The capex outlook is unchanged.

BOBNN SW,BOBNN,Nov 09 2021 01:54AM,Bobst,Capital Goods,FY-21 guidance and positive outlook into FY-22 confirmed ahead of today's CMD ,"Bobst confirms its FY-21 outlook of sales of CHF 1.5bn to CHF 1.6bn (cons. CHF1.544bn, SFe CHF 1.569bn) and EBIT margin of 5% to 6% (cons. 5.5%, SFe 5.8%) ahead of today's CMD in Zurich (excl. an additional positive one-time impact of around CHF 15m from a sale of real-estate property in France - SFe CHF 8m after tax). The long-term financial targets of sales of CHF 1.7bn to CHF 1.8bn, at least an 8% EBIT margin and a minimum 20% ROCE are also confirmed (Vision 2025). ","Furthermore, trends for 2022 look supportive with a positive order outlook for the next 6 to 12 months and a very high 2021 year-end machine backlog (around 8-9 months). Hence, Bobst expects a further increase in sales (cons. +6.6%, SFe +5.0%) and profitability (cons. +70bp to 6.2%; SFe +80bp to 6.6%). At today's CMD, Bobst will provide updates for its business units Printing & Converting and Services & Performance, the latest trends in its various end markets (higher long-term growth expectations compared with this time last year), as well as for sustainable packaging. We expect market expectations to move up slightly after today's CMD. The following bullet points summarise important information from the CMD presentation slides. e@ Confirmed FY-21 outlook: With an order intake increase of +68% in H1-21 and order backlog of +63% at mid-year (with disproportionally higher machine orders, which almost doubled in H1-21), it comes as no surprise that the company confirms its full-year guidance (slides 41/42). At the same time, a normalisation of order entries occurred in recent months, still at a good level (+65% y-o-y in October), but below the exceptionally high level of H1-21 (see slide 40). Bobst provides a positive order outlook for the next 6-12 months. Packaging consumption to increase by USD 110bn to USD 584bn until 2026 (+23%, see slide 30), with higher growth expectations for Folding Carton and Flexible Packaging: Unchanged growth assumptions for end market corrugated board (SFe >40% of H1 sales, investments due to e-commerce; growth expectation of 3.8% for FY-20-23 were confirmed for 2021-26). Higher growth assumptions for end market Folding Carton (SFe >30% of H1 sales, high demand for food, pharma and home & personal care; +3.4% CAGR 2020-25 was increased to +4.7% for 2021-26) and Flexible Packaging (SFe 20% of H1 sales, increased market share, driven by sustainability trends; CAGR 2020-24 +3.3% was increased to +4.5% for 2021-26). The label market (SFe <10% of H1 sales; CAGR 2020-25 +4% was confirmed for 2021-26) showed unchanged growth assumptions, being in a transition period in technology between the analogue and digital world. Updates given for group transformation, sustainability and digitalisation: At the CMD today in Zurich, Bobst will provide an update on its group transformation (slides 37-38), digitalisation and connectivity (slides 9-15), technology solutions (slides 17-21) and sustainability (sldies 24-27, with initiatives for 2021-30 on slide 26). Key trends shaping the industry: Bobst talks about sustainability requirements increasing at every step of the value chain, the trend for increased hygiene concerns, widespread e-commerce, rapidly changing consumer preferences, fast-moving consumer goods and retail margin compression and digitalisation of packaging (slides 31-35).",Christian Arnold,Christian Arnold,100,,Buy,,CHF,4.09,,4.91,,1,1.5,,,,,M,STIFEL_FY-21 guidance_FlashCoNote_Nov 09 2021 01-54AM.pdf,STIFEL_FY-21 guidance_FlashCoNote_Nov 09 2021 01-54AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=b38f55d9-1a75-45c5-86c6-b996184d9621&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

SOW GY,SOW,Nov 23 2021 12:16PM,Software AG,Software,"FY 22 profitability to bounce back, but still waiting for top-line confidence ","We expect subscription growth to remain strong in the coming quarters on theback of booking momentum seen in 2021 YTD and amply aided by the renewal of the first set of three-year subscription contracts signed in FY19. This optimism is partially offset by anaemic growth (excluding renewals bookings) and the company's poor track record on FY guidance in the Digital business. e FY21 should be the year of trough (non-IFRS) EBITA margins and model FY22 margins bouncing back to 21.4% (+200bps y/y, very similar to FY20's level) aided by the pullback of upfront investments in the Digital business to accelerate the transition to subscriptions. We retain our Hold rating on Software AG and increase our price target to €40.00 (from €38.00). e We also publish our ESG analysis on Software AG, which we rate as good despite the lack of stated environmental goals. ","Growth/booking acceleration key While we expect subscription growth to remain solid (up 45% in FY22) in the coming quarters on the back of bookings growth seen in the recent past and the renewal of the first set of three-year contracts signed in FY19, this is balanced by the accelerated drop in perpetual maintenance revenue (down 15% in FY22) driven by weaker perpetual revenue growth in FY20/FY21 and the migration of the installed base to subscriptions. Consequently, we continue to rely to bookings growth to evaluate the success of the business model transition at SOWG. Software AG missed / lowered its initial FY guidance for the Digital business in FY21 and FY19 (and missed initial guidance seven times in the past nine years). Furthermore, Digital booking growth (excluding renewals) was anaemic at +1% in FY20 and -2% in 9M21, given management's focus on harvesting the installed base. This is in complete contrast to the extraordinary demand for digitisation we have seen in recent years globally. We believe that the first migrations should largely consist of lowhanging fruit and it should become increasingly more difficult for SOWG to convince customers to move to subscriptions, making it even more important for SOWG to deliver on new customer-led growth in the coming years. FY21 the year of trough margins On the back of SOWG management's strategic shift in FY19, subscriptions increased to >40% of Digital product revenue in FY21E (from 16% in FY19). However, Digital contribution margins have dropped in the meantime from 27.5% in FY19 to 11.0% in FY21E. This is driven by the lower upfront revenue recognition of subscriptions and from the accelerated investments in the Digital business in the past few years. We expect the accelerated investments to come to an end in FY21 and expect FY22 Digital contribution margins to improve to 15.6% (FY20: 15.4%) resulting in FY22E group (non-IFRS) EBITA of 21.4%, up from company guidance of 17-19% in FY21.

EMSN SW,EMSN,Dec 06 2021 01:00AM,EMS-CHEMIE,Chemicals,Good entry point after share price correction ,"We upgrade EMS to Buy and confirm our PT of CHF 1,020 based on our DCFmodel. We see the share price correction as overdone and offering an attractive entry point. e Global car production should show a sequential improvement in Q4, gradually accelerate in H1 and show steep momentum in H2, in our view. e The shift to EVs should benefit EMS's growth, which has 60% exposure to the automotive industry. The company runs an ambitious investment program with the first large expansion coming on-stream in 2022. e EMS is the only carbon-neutral company in our coverage in its scope 1+2 CO2 emissions. However, its ranking in social and governance aspects is below that of peers. ","Q4 car production shows sequential improvement: After a disappointing September, chip supply should have been better in Q4. We expect this to reflect in higher sales q/ at EMS. H2 earnings might be up by c. +10% y/y supported by better pricing. FY-21 guidance is for an EBIT increase compared to 2019. We see this in reach with an EBIT increase of +2% compared to 2019. Our 2021 forecast is in line with consensus. 2022 with ongoing sequential improvement and accelerating momentum throughout the year: The chip shortage is not over and continues to hold back car production; however, there is potential for progress. We expect EMS to show at least flat volume y/y but rise again q/q in Q1-22. Revenues should increase by mid-single- digits due to higher prices. As of Q2-22, organic growth should be double-digit y/y. As the start of the year might be more modest than previously anticipated, we trimmed our 2022 estimates by -3% for sales and -4% for EBIT, but are still above consensus by +5% and +6%, respectively. Shift to EVs should be a good story for EMS: Materials in connection with the battery and the power train have to be more stress resistant than in combustion engine cars, requiring a higher content of high-end polymers. In particular, high-voltage (HV) and high- temperature (HT) polymers should grow strongly. The demanding requirements around battery (casing, fixing, cooling, electric insulation) speak for strong growth of EMS' high- end materials, in our view. Higher capex prepares for stronger growth: EMS started a high-CHF300m investment program for the site in Domat/Ems to increase capacity by 75% over five years. Capex might be CHF >90m pa in the coming years, of which c. >80% is growth capex. The first large-scale capacity additions come on-stream in H2-22. We think EMS will be well-prepared to participate in the growth story. The company's target is to grow 3-4pp faster than GDP. PT confirmed at CHF 1,020: Our EMS valuation is based on tour DCF model to reflect the long-term growth profile. The slightly lower 2022 estimates had no impact on our DCF value. The current share price is affected by the negative macro and, more specifically, automobile news. However, we are more optimistic going into 2022. Since H2-18, EMS' prime end-customer industry operated in a difficult environment. However, EMS delivered a +4% EBIT CAGR over this period. We expect a substantial acceleration of earnings growth in the coming years with better trends in global car production and the incremental lever due to the switch from ICE to EV, which fuels our upgrade to Buy.",Andreas Heine,Andreas Heine;Isha Sharma,1020,,Buy , Hold ,CHF,23,,27.4,,20.5,23,,,,,M,STIFEL_Good entry_CoNote_Dec 06 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Good entry_CoNote_Dec 06 2021 01-00AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=46a412c8-649f-48a5-9058-9549c835c90c&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

Group sales are slightly ahead ofconsensus and fully in line with our estimates. The biggest surprise today is the strong growth in the Cochlear division, which is a consensus beat on sales by 32.1%.

","Sales of CHF 1,603.8m imply 46.7% organic growth, slightly above consensus at 45.6% and in line with our estimate at 46.2%. The EBITA adj. of CHF 406.4m was 6.2% above our estimate and 7.2% above consensus. e@ H1 performance was driven by Hearing Instruments, which reached sales of CHF 1,465.6m (SFe: -1.5% vs. Cons +0.3%), implies organic growth of 44.9% (SFe: 47.4% vs. Cons: 45.9%). Compared with H1-19/20 (pre-pandemic) this translates into a two- year CAGR of 8.8%. Cochlear implant sales reached CHF 138.3m which was 23.5% above our overly cautious estimate and a considerable 32.1% ahead of consensus. The Audiological care business unit posted sales of CHF 575.4m which implies growth in I.c. of 48.0%. The company was benefiting from the market rebound, but a slower recovery in markets like Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, in combination with temporary lockdowns in Australia and New Zealand, weighed on sales momentum. The Hearing Instruments (Wholesale) business unit posted sales of CHF 890.2m which implies growth in I.c. of 46.2%. The wholesale segment benefited from the continued success of the Phonak Paradise platform, which was further expanded by the introduction of Audeo Life as well as ActiveVent. In addition, Unitron launched its new BLU platform, powered by the same chip as the Phonak Paradise, in April-21 supporting wholesale growth. The group had recorded one-off income of CHF 99.0 million from damages awarded in a patent infringement lawsuit.

VBK GY,VBK,Nov 30 2021 10:46AM,VERBIO,Oil & Gas,Good outlook strong push for EBITDA guidance ,"VERBIO increased its EBITDA guidance materially from €150m to €230m, a 53%increase that is 24% ahead of our estimates and 19% ahead of consensus. The ","gap between our estimates and the new guidance is coming from conservative modeling of spreads into H2, which seem to be much more clear for the company. We learned that all business units are contributing well to the increased guidance and understand that the company feels very confident about the guidance, barred complete shutdown. Today's guidance raise is fully in line with our view that the current fiscal year will be a stellar one. We currently believe that visibility has improved into Q3, after an already strong second quarter. If spreads remain high, we assume that there could be further upside potential coming from Q4, where visibility currently is still low.

RWE GY,RWE,Nov 11 2021 02:37AM,RWE,Utilities,Good Q3 and construction schedule in Renewables well on track ,"Conclusion: RWE published a good set of Q3-21 results, above consensus, with GroupEBITDA up by 65% vs Q3-20. Strong quarter is explained by a good performance of Renewables, which benefited from new offshore and onshore capacity since Q3-20, as well as earnings from the U.K capacity market and higher generation margins in coal and nuclear. Construction schedule in Renewables is well on track and indicates at least 13.3 ","GW of operating capacity by end-2022, reaching the target of more than 13 GW. The firm will update on its investment strategy in Renewables at the CMD on November 15. Financial KPls: Core adj. EBITDA is 2.1% above consensus at €1,677m (-9% y/y vs -21% in H1-21), group adj. EBIT is 6.4% above consensus at €1,339m (+17% y/y vs -6% in H1-21) and adj. net income came 5.6% above consensus at €1,026m (+35% y/y vs +7% in H1-21). Renewables on track to reach >13 GW by end-2022: installed renewables capacity (pro-rata) stands at 9.5 GW and projects under construction at 3.8 GW, implying a total of 13.3 GW operational by the end of next year. The target of ""more than 13 GW"" should be reached. 800 MW are expected to be commissioned by year-end, and 3 GW during 2022. In Q3, the Group took FID for 500 MW to be commissioned in 2022 and beyond, mainly onshore and solar projects in the US and Europe. Renewables up 45% in Q3: despite continued adverse wind conditions in Europe in Q3, EBITDA from renewables (offshore, onshore, solar) was up 45% in Q3 (offshore: +29%, onshore/solar: +111%). In offshore, positive impact came from the acquisition of a majority interest in the UK offshore wind farm Rampion, as well as earnings from the Triton Knoll wind farm (RWE share: 506 MW), where all the 90 turbines are now installed. In onshore/solar, EBITDA mainly benefited from capital gains from the sale of shares in three US onshore wind farms and earnings from new capacity commissioned since Q3-20. Supply and trading and Coal/Nuclear: performance of the trading unit was up 9% in Q3 vs Q3-20. In Coal/Nuclear, EBITDA was up 146% driven by higher generation margins, reflecting high power prices in Europe. Hydro/biomass/gas: EBITDA was up 129% in Q3, mainly driven by higher capacity payments in the U.K and gains from the optimisation of its power station use. Leverage at 1.1x LTM EBITDA: net debt stands at €2,866m or 1.1x LTM Core EBITDA (FY-20: €4.4bn, 1.7x EBITDA). Decrease is mainly related to OCF (€-1.8bn), lower pensions provisions due to higher interest rates (€-0.8bn), and timing effects (€-1.9bn) such as variation margins from hedging activities. e@ 2021 guidance is confirmed: in 2021 RWE guides for an adj. EBITDA Group range of €3.0-3.4bn, a core adj. EBITDA range of €2.15-2.55bn, an adj. EBIT range of €1.5-1.9bn and an adj. net income range of €1.05-1.4bn. Dividend target is confirmed at €0.90/share.

IFCN SW,IFCN,Oct 21 2021 01:54AM,Inficon,Technology Hardware,Good Q3 leads to another guidance increase ,Inficon has reported a good Q32021 with revenues about in-line with our andconsensus estimates while the EBIT was a slight beat vs consensus and a slight miss vs our estimates. The main reason Inficon reached the consensus estimates ,"on revenue was the General Vacuum business and not the semi-conductor related business which is a slight surprise but can be explained with tight supply situation. The EBIT margin was about in-line with consensus. Despite a high revenue growth 32.8% and the highest quarterly revenues in history, the margin did not get over 18%. This is a result of investments in additional capacity (ramp-up costs) and still high R&D expenditures for future growth. Inficon has a strong order book and good capacity utilization and therefore raises its revenue guidance one more time from USD 480m - 500m to new USD 490m - 510m with an EBIT margin between 18% and 20% (unchanged). Consensus stands at USD 495.7m (SFe USD 499m) and an EBIT margin of 19.1% (SFe 19.%). Conclusion: Good Q3 result that mainly reached consensus estimates due to the General Vacuum business and not the direct semiconductor business. But with better supply situation, Inficon would have grown even faster. Guidance increase does not come unexpected and should lead to estimate changes of around 2% on revenues and EBIT in the same magnitude (consensus is at the mid-point more or less).

The positive surprise is the General Vacuum business which saw a clear beat vs estimates (see table). Outlook good, also on Semis - Supply hinders stronger growth Inficon runs at full capacity in almost all areas and needs to increase capacity (clean rooms, equipment, calibration capabilities) to handle the order book. Management says the semiconductor business is still doing very well mainly in all Asia and China. We view the message given today as positive for Inficon's future growth capabilities but also for the other semi names in Switzerland. We prefer Comet but Inficon interesting for more defensive semi-investors The Inficon outlook and guidance increase provides a positive cross-read also for Comet as their semi-growth is even more dynamic at the moment. We therefore still prefer Comet (Buy, CHF339.50) but for Investors who would like to have a semi-exposure but less aggressive (as Inficon serves OEMs and producers), Inficon has its appeal.

KWS GY,KWS,Oct 25 2021 01:49AM,KWS Saat,Chemicals,Growth should outpace rising costs ,"We reiterate our PT of EUR 82 and Hold rating. Our earnings forecast showsonly minor changes after 2020/21 results and is ahead of guidance. e KWS does not expect seed price increases to be enough to offset higher costs. However, we expect underlying growth to drive earnings up. e Corn seed should see double-digit growth in 2021/22, in our view. e Sugar Beet should beat the guidance with at least mid-single digit sales growth, in our view. ","We expect KWS to slightly beat the upper end of its EBIT guidance. KWS guidance is for 5-7% growth and a slight decline in group EBIT margin from 12.5% to 11-12%. The upper end translates to EUR 1.4bn sales and EUR 168m adjusted consolidated EBIT. Our revenue forecast is in line with the guidance but our adj. EBIT forecast is at EUR 179m (consensus: EUR 176m). The deviation is exclusively explained by the Sugar Beet segment. The CFO has also indicated that this segment might offer upside to the guidance. Seed companies benefit only with long delay from higher crop prices: Seed companies can only increase prices once a year ahead of the sowing season. Any price increase is rather moderate. Higher crop prices mean at first higher seed-multiplying costs (largest item with 25-30% of total costs). Currently, higher processing and logistics costs as well as the FX headwind in 2020/21 translate to a net negative margin impact. However, prices are sticky and would not be lowered in a more challenging environment, as outlined by Bayer at its CropScience webinar. We estimate it would probably take two years for seed companies to benefit from the improved agro environment. R&D has high priority: The CFO highlighted that it is not the intention of KWS to bring the EBIT margin up to 15-16%. The target range stays at 11-13%. In other words, from the 12.5% reached in 2020/21 there is only limited upside. Any over-earning would be reinvested in R&D, which should be at 18-20% of sales. Therefore, future earnings growth will likely be just parallel to the top-line growth. Corn continues to be the growth driver: KWS makes inroads in South and Southeast Europe with market share gains of new competitive varieties of grain corn. Most impressive is the growth in LatAm. KWS gained 1pp market share and is now at 9% in Brazil, which translates to 30% volume growth last year. KWS started selling its own corn seed varieties in Brazil in 2018. We expect double-digit Corn sales growth in 2021/22. However, Brazil and South/ Southeastern Europe have below-average margin. Despite the operational leverage, the EBIT margin might be only flat, as highlighted in the guidance. Sugar Beet with great success with Conviso Smart and CR+t: In combination, varieties with these traits generated c. EUR 100m sales in 2020/21, i.e. c. 20% of segment sales. KWS gained 2% market share, which is now at 64%, translating to stable volume despite global acreage decline of -3%. We expect a similar pattern this year and assume 6-7% sales growth, helped by somewhat higher prices, the rising penetration of the two (conventional) traits and an FX tailwind. However, rising processing and seed multiplying costs prevent us from increasing our margin estimate, according to the guidance.",Andreas Heine,Andreas Heine;Isha Sharma,82,,Hold,,EUR,4.23,,4.46,,0.9,1,,,,,M,STIFEL_Growth should_CoNote_Oct 25 2021 01-49AM.pdf,STIFEL_Growth should_CoNote_Oct 25 2021 01-49AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=0f5c6c38-14a9-4fe8-811c-08faf250e73c&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
BNR GY,BNR,Nov 04 2021 03:13AM,Brenntag SE,Chemicals,Guidance confirmed - CFO change ,"FY21 EBITDA guidance of €1,260-€1,320m reiterated which implies an EBITDArange of €262-322m for Q4-21. This compares to our expectation of €327m and consensus €309m. Company expects the exceptional market conditions to persist well into 2022, driven by pressure on supply chains, energy costs and developments in China. ","Further management change: After serving as CFO for 10 years, Georg Muller will not extend his contract beyond March 2022. After the departure of the North American and European CEOs and appointment of Chief Transformation officer, Ewout Van Jarwaarde, this is the fourth change in the board of management after the appointment of CEO, Christian Kohlpaintner. Project Brenntag contributions accelerated to €55m in 9M-21 (€26m in H1-21) incrementally over 2020. This implies there is more to come in FY22 based on company's guidance of front loaded savings, which now show an increasing momentum. Based on company comments of persisting favorable market conditions, Brenntag could show earnings increase, at least in H1-22. Therefore, the underlying development still points to >€1.3bn EBITDA in FY22. Q3-21 was in line with expectations with EBITDA of €343m (Stifel: €339m, cons. €337m). Brenntag Essentials saw a conversion ratio of 40.5%, -350bps q/q due to sequential decline in EMEA conversion ratio by 7%, potentially some normalisation, in our view. Brenntag Specialties was again resilient with conversion ratio decline of only -80bps q/q with slight weakness in Pharma and Personal Care/HI&I. Here, North America showed a sequential acceleration. The company outlined strict COVID-19 lockdowns in Southeast Asia to have had a negative impact. However, the region is still small on the group level. Brenntag FCF i.e. EBITDA - capex - lease payments - change in NWC for 9M-21 came in at €352m, -56% y/y. The biggest swing factor was NWC which saw a strong net outflow of €-443m (9M-20: €+214m).

ALGTR FP,ALGTR,Oct 29 2021 09:44AM,Groupe TERA,SPONSORED RESEARCH Business Services,H1-21 results - the story is well on track ,"Groupe TERA published its H1-21 results this morning. CEO Pascal Kaluzny alsoheld a webcast conference with investors. H1-21 revenue came in at €5m, up +86% yly, thus standing 10% above FY-19 levels. The strong performance was driven by (1) organic and external growth in the lab testing division and (2) the acceleration in commercial momentum in the Sensors division. Profitability thus continued to improve sequentially. The group does not provide quantitative guidance, but seems quite confident in its ability to deliver ""solid profitable growth in 2021"". We believe Groupe TERA is perfectly on track to generate revenues of €10m in 2021, up +60% y/y. In addition, the group's profitability should continue to improve, driven by operating leverage. In conclusion, the story is on track, in our view, and we reiterate our Buy rating. ","Strong growth in the lab segment, driven by M&A. H1 revenue growth benefited from the first time consolidation of Toxilabo in January and February (closing was March 2020). It also benefited from the first time consolidation of the lab acquired from Apave (now called TERA Contréle) from April 2021. The laboratory division thus generated revenues of €4.6m in H1-21, up from €2.6m in H1-20, and €4.1m in FY-19. Acceleration in the sensors segment. In H1, the group sold c.4,000 NextPM sensors, and the division's revenue stood at €0.4m, up from €0.3m in FY-20 and €0.2m in FY-19. The CEO highlighted that the company was reaching an inflection point in the sales cycle. Though the group is not providing guidance, it expects the positive trend to continue. In addition, the division benefits from a very significant operating leverage and, as volumes rise, profitability should materially improve. Improving profitability. The operating loss was limited to -€0.1m in H1-21, thus improving sequentially from -€0.3m last semester, and -€0.5m in H1-20. We understand this was driven by mix and operating leverage. Over the short term, the consolidation of new acquisitions in the more profitable laboratory segment should generate a positive mix effect. In addition, we could expect some incremental synergies to be unlocked. In the sensors segment, the profitability should mechanically improve as higher volumes drive operating leverage. Strategic focus & capital allocation. Following the acquisition of Toxilabo and Apave's lab (now called TERA Contréle), the group has now reached a critical size in the laboratory division, in terms of geographic coverage and testing portfolio. The CEO stated that they would nevertheless remain open to attractive opportunities. However, the strategic focus is now shifting to the commercial ramp-up of the sensors. In addition, R&D continues to address more end markets with the addition of the Next PM CR, and the NextPM LITE. e@ Chip-shortage risk. The CEO stated during the conference that they had anticipated the current headwinds, and had built up some inventory. The group is making efforts to find solutions and diversify its sourcing. We understand the group has enough headroom to deliver on sensors orders over the next 6-8 months. Nevertheless, continued shortages beyond that timeframe could impact the group's production. NWC momentarily impacted by M&A. Groupe TERA reported a -€1.7m cash outflow from changes in NWC in H1. We estimate that NWC increased from c.10% to c.19% of group T12M revenue. This was driven by the consolidation of the lab acquired from Apave (now called TERA Contrdéle), which only contributed to three months of revenue out of six during the semester. In addition, the transition may have initially delayed some of the billing process. Nevertheless, CEO Pascal Kaluzny seemed confident during the call that this was a temporary effect and the NWC outflow should progressively reverse.",Nicolas Tabor,Nicolas Tabor,5,,Buy,,EUR,-0.1,,0.01,,,,,,,,M,STIFEL_H1-21 results_FlashCoNote_Oct 29 2021 09-44AM.pdf,STIFEL_H1-21 results_FlashCoNote_Oct 29 2021 09-44AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=f9b2eee9-3779-49da-b631-35379f8a9ad8&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

The net sales performance per division is comparable to the situation a year ago, when the pandemic hit the company. Only measuring devices reported a material sales decline of -27% y/y. Klingelnberg further expects an EBIT impact of €50-55m, which drags the expected annual EBIT to €30-40m. ","Bevel Gear. Order intake increase by €5.1m driven by some returning orders from OEM. However, seems to remain on muted levels. Cylincdrical Gear. Growth impulses coming from wind power and general mechanical engineering. No order intake given. Measuring Devices.

Both segments contributed to the overall success, but interestingly and to our surprise, Bioethanol less than Biodiesel. Still, given the ongoing momentum in VERBIO's end-markets, the company remains bullish on H1 and we see potential to exceed the €87m EBITDA we currently model, despite the initial disappointment to our Q1 estimates.

Guidance of €150m EBITDA is confirmed; no revenue guidance provided. The weak performance in the Bioethanol segment is coming from an increased stockpiling of GHG-quotas in order to sell them at a later point in time.

SGO FP,SGO,Oct 29 2021 01:00AM,Compagnie de Saint Gobain,Building Materials,Held Back By Limited Catalysts For Now?! ,"Saint Gobain reported in line Q3-21 sales after the close of bourse yesterday.The key message probably was that the H2-21 price cost spread is likely to be negative, while for the FY-21 that spread should still be positive. A price increase of +9% was needed to keep the H2-21 price cost spread positive vs a current expectation of +8%. With regard to 2022 the messages were generally positive, albeit understandably with limited clarity or commitment at this point in time. That being said, the underlying trend is seen at low single digit levels (at ~3%), while price increases are expected to cover further cost increases. Overall, we see no real good or bad news coming out of this update, which should leave the shares fairly stable on the day. As said in our preview, we would expect the shares to linger or fall back (also against the sector) in the short-term. The CMD is behind us and the Group now needs to deliver in terms of ROCE, while minimising the reversal of the positive COVID-19 impact. That said, with its high exposure to Europe and its underappreciated ESG credentials, this stock falls into the value camp we quite like.

HER IM,HER,Nov 10 2021 01:47PM,Hera,Utilities,Hera's exposure to economic recovery drove Q3-21 growth ,"Hera's Q3-21 results confirmed the single-digit EBITDA growth historicallyreported each quarter by the company. EBITDA and net profit were slightly better than our and consensus estimates. Q3-21 EBITDA increased by 7% y/y, and it was 3% higher than our estimate. Growth was mainly driven by the impact of economic recovery in Italy on the waste and gas businesses. The waste business benefited from increasing volumes, treatment prices and electricity prices. The gas business benefited from the positive momentum in the energy efficiency services and stronger contribution from the special customers supplied by Hera. Net profit grew by 38% y/y on reported basis. Net of positive one-offs it declined by 9% yly (it was 4% higher than our estimate), mainly due to higher DD&As linked to investments. Solid operating cash flow determined a modest 2% increase in net debt versus end 2020, almost fully offsetting dividend payments, capex acceleration and cash-out for M&A in the period. ","We confirm our Buy rating on the stock. Hera's business model has proven highly resilient to the economic downturn determined by Covid19, and now it is positively exposed to economic recovery, mainly through the waste business and increasing consumption of gas and electricity. We think that the low-risk growth offered by the company and the reliability of its management are underestimated by the current share price. The stock trades at attractive multiples both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Detailed Q3-21 results are as follows: EBITDA increased by 7% y/y to €265m, 3% higher than our €258m estimate. As we anticipated, the main growth drivers were represented by: 1) the gas business, whose EBITDA increased by 82% y/y to €89m. It was 59% higher than our €56m estimate, mainly due to better performance of the energy efficiency business. Strong contribution to EBITDA growth in the quarter derived also from the FUI and ""default"" gas markets; 2) the waste business, whose EBITDA increased by 24% y/y to €76m (8% higher than our estimate). The positive performance was determined by recovery of waste volumes treated (mainly thanks to demand for treatment of special waste, linked to industrial production), price hikes for recycled plastic produced by Aliplast, continuing positive trend for waste treatment prices and higher selling price for the electricity produced by waste-to-energy plants. Those positive effects were partially offset by: a) the electricity business, where EBITDA declined by 72% y/y to €14m (significantly lower than our €45m estimate), mainly due to lower contribution from the ""salvaguardia"" customers and b) the water business, whose EBITDA declined by 3% y/y to €76m, mainly due to rising electricity costs, which will be eventually recovered. Reported net profit increased by 38% to €92m. Net of the positive tax-related one- offs, it declined by 9% y/y to €61m (versus our €59m estimate). Higher DD&As (linked to investment acceleration), financial costs related to the energy efficiency business and higher minorities offset at the bottom line growth at EBITDA level. Investments continued to accelerate. Including M&A transactions completed in the period, investments reached €220m in Q3-21, 43% higher than in Q3-20. Net debt increased by a modest 2% versus end 2020 to €3.30bn. Solid operating cash flow almost fully offset dividend payments, accelerating investments and cash-out for M&A in the period.",Enrico Bartoli,Enrico Bartoli,4.1,,Buy,,EUR,0.23,,0.23,,0.12,0.12,,,,,M,STIFEL_Hera's exposure_FlashCoNote_Nov 10 2021 01-47PM.pdf,STIFEL_Hera's exposure_FlashCoNote_Nov 10 2021 01-47PM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=0bbaa598-e8a0-42b2-a8d5-c1784b0ec013&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
VOW3 GY,VOW3,Dec 03 2021 01:17AM,Volkswagen AG,Automotive,Here is our worst idea — and why we stick to it ," We upgraded VW in Dec 2020 as volumes recovered and the fight between unions andmanagement was over (we thought). With additional tailwind from the excitement about the EV strategy, VW rose 62% in Q1 2021, outperforming the SXAP, which advanced 7.5%. However, In April-December the stock lost 30%, compared with a 7.6% gain in the SXAP. The positive factors reversed (volumes under pressure, slow BEV sales in China), while negative factors came back forcefully (conflict between CEO and unions). Back to square one — sentiment is the most negative among OEMs. e What to do with the share? The situation looks similar to Dec 2020: Volumes should recover from here, in our view. VW's biggest plants should benefit most (Wolfsburg +35% y-o-y). When volumes go up, VW's high operating leverage becomes a positive. The issues between management and unions will likely be resolved by 9 Dec, one way or the other. Sale of ID models in China gains momentum. We believe the sentiment towards VW is even more negative than a year ago. We think VW is once again the OEM to own into the coming year. ","When volumes go up, we don't want an efficient OEM — we want VW: Among the largest OEMs worldwide, VW was hit above average from the ship shortage (Figure 2). Based on IHS data, VW will be among the fastest growing OEMs in 2022 (Figure 3 — several factors support the positive view). VW has high fixed costs, high vertical integration — that should be positive when volumes rise. Wolfsburg +35%: We looked into detailed forecasts plant by plant for the biggest OEMs. In Wolfsburg, production is expected to increase by 35% y-o-y and in Skoda's Mlada Boleslav plant by 45% — more than in any other large OE plant globally (Figure 4). VW brand and Skoda were both unprofitable in Q3, but should return to profitability soon, by our forecast. BEV production: The slow start of the ID.4 in China is a major concern. VW is the market leader in China, but its market share in BEVs is much smaller and new operators are entering the market. However, we saw momentum accelerate in September to November (Figure 5). With 55.5k units of the ID. cars sold year to date, we believe VW could end up >70k units in 2021, close to the company's initial 80k-unit target. We think this would be perceived positively. Leadership: the conflict between CEO Diess and unions weighed on the share price in H2 2022. The outcome is uncertain; we think the likelihood that Mr. Diess will be ousted is around 50%. Just few months ago our view would have been that such news would be a major negative, that the stock would be down 2-digits. However, at this point we believe the share price reaction probably depends on who the potential successor would be. We think Porsche AG's Oliver Blume would be generally liked by the market, and the stock could be up. In our opinion, VW brand CEO Brandstatter would be seen as too close to the unions, and the market would be more likely to react negatively.

EVK GY,EVK,Nov 05 2021 02:02AM,Evonik,Chemicals,High confidence into 2022 ,"Estimates changed only slightly for 2022 but bear upside risk.e@ On top of solid underlying trends, we see a number of reasons for a positive earnings trend in 2022. e FCF better at >€1bn in 2021 but limited upside in 2022. ","Evonik management shows strong conviction for ongoing earnings growth in 2022. Demand trends across the portfolio continues to be strong in Q4 and no change is anticipated for the start of 2022. Management expects pent-up demand when supply and logistic constrains fade over the course of next year. Price increases accelerated and the exit rate at Q3 was higher than the ASP. In 2022, a net price effect should be clearly positive, according to management. Company-specific drivers add to the generally favourable trends: Evonik had one- time headwinds of >€60m in H2-21 (should be absent in 2022). The new PA12 value chain (four of six plants are already running) should ramp up faster than expected given strong demand and tight supply. As the other parts of Smart Materials also show solid trends, it is probably the segment with the strongest earnings momentum in 2022. In Healthcare, Evonik expects strong growth (>+25%) in lipids for MRNA with 12-month deliveries to BioNTech in 2022. Consumer Care benefits from repositioning of the business towards innovative and high margin products, especially if it comes to actives in cosmetics. Acquisitions over recent years are bearing fruit and are contributing to earnings growth. Methionine prices are up and the environment should stay favourable at least in H1-22. The combined drivers in Healthcare, Consumer Care and Animal Nutrition suggest strong double-digit EBITDA growth at Nutrition & Care in 2022. We are more cautious with a moderate increase in EBITDA at Specialty Additives. Volume should increase at least by mid-single digits, but we have not assumed that the margin will increase next year. On the back of these assumptions, we expect Evonik to approach €2.6bn EBITDA in 2022 (+7% y/y). Upside risk to our 2022 estimates: We see our forecasts as cautious. We note three levers of potential upside risk: (1) ongoing strong price momentum at Specialty Additives could translate into better margins than assumed, (2) the methionine market could be tight for longer (our estimates factor weak earnings in H2-22 in) and (3) we forecast considerably lower margins at the C4 value chain, but a rebound in automotive production (butadiene for rubbers) and MTBE (mileage driven) could result in a more favourable environment than anticipated in our forecasts. FCF of >€1bn in 2021 and 2022: Management has indicated that FCF should increase again in 2022: EBITDA should be up, capex will stay at €850-900m and NWC requirements should be lower. However, bonus payments will be much higher next year. We therefore expect only a moderate FCF increase in 2022, but solid momentum mid- term.",Andreas Heine,pevonuene;ndreas Heine;Isha Sharma,36,,Buy,,EUR,2,,2.3,,1.15,1.2,,,,,M,STIFEL_High confidence_CoNote_Nov 05 2021 02-02AM.pdf,STIFEL_High confidence_CoNote_Nov 05 2021 02-02AM,EARNINGS UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=1ae007d3-ecd5-419f-9691-409d25302b2d&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

SIKA SW,SIKA,Oct 22 2021 02:27AM,Sika,Construction Supplier,High operating leverage compensates again for negative raw material impact ,"strong set of Q3/9M-21 results, with group sales pretty much in line with(demanding) market expectations and above our (overly cautious) forecasts. The higher-than-assumed negative raw material impact was compensated for by more pronounced operating leverage. ","Sika reiterated its FY-21 growth guidance (local currency growth of 13% to 17%) and guidance for its EBIT margin reaching 15% (Vara Research consensus stands at +16.3% and 15.4% vs SFe +14.8% and +15.3%). We expect consensus FY-21 forecasts to remain quite stable or to be revised slightly down. We reiterate our Buy rating, expecting Sika to benefit from various stimulus programmes and ongoing mega trends (sustainable and industrialised construction, environmentally friendly mobility). The gross margin will probably fall temporarily below 53%, significantly below the target range of 54-55% in FY-21E, but this could be mitigated by operating leverage. Sika's group sales grew +9.0%/+18.1% in local currency in Q3/9M (consensus +9.3%/+18.1%, SFe +5.7%/+16.8%): Reported 9M group sales of CHF 6,863m (cons. CHF 6,867m; SFe CHF 6,787m) benefited from a positive FX impact of +0.1% (SFe +0.1%) as well as a positive scope effect of +1.3% (SFe +1.2% and hence grew organically by +16.8% (SFe +15.6%). Higher negative raw material impact mitigated by operating efficiency: The gross margin declined 200bp to 52.6% (SFe 53.1%). Thanks to scale effects and improved efficiencies of product processes, the EBITDA margin increased 80bp to 19.3% (SFe 19.4%) and the EBIT margin by 170bp to 15.4% (cons. 15.5%; SFe 15.3%).

AKE FP,AKE,Nov 10 2021 01:54AM,Arkema,Chemicals,Higher guidance after strong beat in Q3 ,"Arkema increased EBITDA guidance from +30% y/y to at least +40% for thecore activities. Group EBITDA guidance is now EUR 1.6bn (Stifel: EUR 1.64bn, consensus: EUR 1.55bn), which reflects the strong acrylic margins and dynamic growth in High Performance Polymers. Q3-21 clean EBITDA of EUR 474m (Stifel: EUR 448m, consensus: EUR 416m) is even higher than our ambitious forecast. High momentum in HPP, defending margins in Adhesives and high acrylic margins explain the strong outcome. Therefore, every segment contributed to the earnings beat. ","Acrylics with ongoing high margins: High European and US acrylic margins are reflected in the strong earnings increase at Coating Solutions and the Asian margins pushed Intermediates earnings up, despite lower production rates in China in the second half of September. The margin situation should stay favorable in Q4 and going into 2022. Coating Solutions increased EBITDA y/y by 2.5x and was also up q/q. The strong performance in Coating Solutions is the main deviation to group consensus EBITDA. Advanced Materials again with high momentum at High Performance Polymers (HPP): This could be already expected after strong results of Solvay's Specialty Polymers. Especially battery applications of PVDF drive the growth (PA10-12 is at capacity). Volume of the segment was up by 13% y/y, but significantly higher in HPP, as the second division, Performance Additives, reported only moderate growth due to production restrictions at Thiochemicals in Malaysia as well as soft demand from oil & gas. H202 was held back by low demand from the paper industry. Adhesives showed a solid performance and managed to defend 14% margin despite strong headwind from raw material cost inflation and logistics. Volume showed decline by -2.3% y/y, explained by the comparison base but also by logistic constraints. The four bolt-on acquisitions contributed with +4.8% growth. The margin target of 14% is confirmed. FCF strongly affected by rising NWC: Q3 FCF was EUR 74n,, significantly below last year. The outflow of EUR -103m in NWC compared to an inflow of EUR +158m in the year before and EUR -98m capital gain tax for the PMMA disposal are the main reasons. Capex is high due to the PA11 project and was EUR 64m, almost twice as high as Q3-20. Net debt: During the quarter, net debt declined slightly to EUR 1.26bn (Q2: EUR 1.3bn, FY-20: EUR 1.9bn).",Andreas Heine,Andreas Heine;Isha Sharma,147,,Buy,,EUR,10.3,,9.6,,2.8,3,,,,,M,STIFEL_Higher guidance_FlashCoNote_Nov 10 2021 01-54AM.pdf,STIFEL_Higher guidance_FlashCoNote_Nov 10 2021 01-54AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=d3335b02-8001-4ec3-821d-2e1a9dc59aa3&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
SIGN SW,SIGN,Oct 29 2021 06:00AM,SIG Combibloc,Capital Goods,Higher uncertainties in the short term trigger lower estimates ,"SIG is initiating price increases to offset higher costs, but these will only beeffective at the beginning of next year. The company is yet to provide any guidance about the magnitude of the price increase(s). e This uncertainty, in combination with the small miss on the Q3-21 results and the cautious outlook for Q4-21, has triggered downward earnings estimates for FY-21E as well as for FY-22E/23E. e Our unchanged valuation approach indicates a new price target of CHF 25.0 (down from CHF 26.7). We reiterate our Hold rating. ","Small miss on Q3-21 results but FY-21 guidance confirmed Adjusted for the scope effect of the first-time full consolidation of the former MEA joint venture and FX, SIG Combibloc achieved an underlying growth rate of +4.2% in Q3-21 (cons +4.9%, SFe +5.9%), following the I-f-| growth of +8.8% in H1-21. The adjusted EBITDA margin was up 40bp to 27.2% (cons. 27.6%; SFe 27.7%) in 9M21 but down 310bp to 27.1% in Q3-21 (cons. 28.1%, SFe 28.4%) on the back of higher raw material, freight and energy costs, as well as higher SG&A. On the back of the 9M-21 l-f-| organic growth rate of +7.1% (SFe 7.8%), the company confirmed FY-21 growth guidance for core revenue growth in local currency of 4-6% and comments that ""the upper half of the 4-6% range remains a possibility"" (cons. +6.4%; SFe 7.4%). No change in adj. EBITDA margin guidance of 27-28% (cons. 27.6%, SFe 28.0%). Lowered earnings estimates for FY-21/22/23E Cautious wording in terms of Q4-21 outlook (year-end rally likely to be subdued in Asia Pacific and Americas, strong Q4 base of comparison in Americas, some customers building safety stocks in South East Asia in Q3; at the group level, the growth rate in the fourth quarter is expected to be relatively weak) leads to FY-21/23/23E sales forecast reduction of -2%/0%/-1% and EBITDA forecast reduction of -4%/-4%/-5%. Raw material prices to become headwind in FY-22E, after neutral impact in FY-21E and tailwind in FY-20 Lower spot prices for polymers and aluminum supported FY-20 EBITDA margin by some +120bp (27.4%) and by some +70bp in H1-21 (27.3%). However, these became a tailwind in Q3, with about -100bp (27.1%). SIG expects the full year impact to be broadly neutral, implying a somewhat less negative impact in Q4-21. The relatively low impact of raw material prices on the EBITDA margin is because the largest part of the raw material bill is linked to liquid paper board, for which multi-year contracts are in place, which secure supply and provide protection against inflationary pressure. The smaller part of the bill is linked to aluminum and polymers, for which a hedging policy is in place (for approx. 80% of the anticipated purchases of coming year). Low visibility in terms of price increases SIG Combibloc has not commented much on prices in the past. The company usually negotiates prices in Q4 for the following year. This time, and assuming persistent cost inflation, staged price moves are more likely than just a single step at the beginning of the year. However, the company did not provide any guidance about future potential price increase(s). This would be relevant in terms of FY-22 growth and/or adjusted EBITDA margin guidance and estimates. We assume a rather modest price increase (low single- digit percentage points). According to CEO Samuel Sigrist, pre-buying or pre-stocking effects in Q4-21 ahead of the introduction of price increases at the beginning of next year are not expected. However, we would not rule that out (which is one reason why our forecast is in line with the upper end of the 4% to 6% guidance).",Christian Arnold,Christian Arnold,25,26.7,Hold,,EUR,0.74,,0.83,,0.45,0.5,,,,,M,STIFEL_Higher uncertainties_CoNote_Oct 29 2021 06-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Higher uncertainties_CoNote_Oct 29 2021 06-00AM,EARNINGS UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=23628bf2-19b4-4d6e-9c93-46e78f26beec&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
BMW GY,BMW,Nov 09 2021 01:00AM,BMW AG,Automotive,Hold rating maintained - but momentum is improving ,"We increase our EPS estimates for BMW by an average 10% in 2022 and 2023.The net cash position further increased and is now equivalent to 38% of the market capitalization. Financial Services is generating a RoE of >20% - valued at a very conservative 1x book value it is worth another 35% of the current market capitalization. That implies a very low valuation based on EV multiples. Classic OEMs are not being rewarded for hoarding huge amounts of cash. However, with the coming consolidation of the Chinese JV and potential to distribute more cash to shareholders, we think the BMW investment case should become more attractive in 2022. For the time being, we prefer Daimler (Buy, €87.23) into the spin-off and VW (Buy, €187.52), with very negative investor sentiment. Our estimates for BMW are below consensus, too. Our target price of EUR116 remains unchanged - it implies a target PE-ratio of 7.9x. Assuming the consolidation of the China JV, this target PE-ratio declines to around 7.4x. ","Change in estimates: We increase our 2022 EPS estimate by 11% to EUR14.67 and our 2023 EPS forecast by 8.2% to 14.70. We model an 8.9% and 9.1% Automobiles EBIT margin in 2022 and 2023, respectively. This reflects a more positive view on the sustainability on the positive pricing environment. With the supply of young used cars likely to remain limited in 2022 and 2023, used car prices should remain on an elevated level. That means, also in the mid-term, used cars are not becoming an attractive alternative to new cars - that should support pricing for new cars, too. Momentum could improve from here: The BMW investment case becomes more attractive in 2022, in our view. Sentiment is rather cautious, and BMW is seen as a lagger in electric mobility. However, with the ix and i4 on the market, momentum should pick up. BMW trades at very low EV multiples; the 2022 industrial EV/EBITDA multiple stands at 0.6x, the industrial EV/EBIT multiple at 1.1x. This reflects the high net cash position and, we contend, is not a strong argument to buy an OEM - the market takes significant discount on the net cash position of OEMs, specifically those with captive financial services. However, BMW announced it will buy another 25% of the Chinese JV in 2022 and subsequently consolidate the JV; this should be earnings accretive, in our view. The reported net cash position would also increase post the transaction (as the JV is net-cash positive). This will allow BMW distribute more cash to shareholders, e.g. through a special dividend or a higher payout ratio. Why not a Buy rating? Among the German OEMs, we continue to prefer VW and Daimler. We believe the Daimler investment case with the upcoming spin-off of Trucks, the high cash conversion rates and the product momentum at Mercedes is even more attractive. Daimler's management is also more focused on the share price performance, in our opinion. VW offers more long-term upside potential due to its resolute move into BEVs and the scale advantage it should soon have in this area, as well as potential asset sales. Our new BMW estimates increased but remain 2% to 5.5% below consensus expectations. Our CO2 model implies that BMW is generating higher CO2 emissions than Daimler and VW. We are very confident that BMW will meet the regulatory targets but we just note the gap is slightly larger, which means the incremental headwind is higher.",Daniel Schwarz,"Daniel Schwarz;Pierre-Yves Quémeéner;Alexander Wahl, CFA",116,,Hold,,EUR,18.4,,14.7,,6.06,5.13,,,,,M,STIFEL_Hold rating_CoNote_Nov 09 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Hold rating_CoNote_Nov 09 2021 01-00AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=028c68bb-68fb-4eaf-a283-644b390435de&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
HLAG GY,HLAG,Dec 14 2021 06:12AM,Hapag-Lloyd,Transportation,How to play second fiddle - reiterate Hold ,"We stick to our Hold rating as the main drivers of Hapag-Lloyd's share price aresimilar to those driving Maersk, except for: e A lower share of contract rates that protect against a drop in spot rates. e@ Weare 10% below FY23e consensus EBITDA estimates, while we are 17% ahead for Maersk with respect to FY23e EBITDA. e A lack of a clear vision what to do with the windfall gain of the pandemic period. e Lower free float and higher share price volatility while trading at ~8x FY23e EV/ EBITDA vs. Maersk at ~3x FY23e EV/EBITDA. ","This note should be read in conjunction with our sector note - European Logistics: No such thing as ""pre-crisis"" margins We believe Hapag-Lloyd is fairly valued ... Hapag-Loyd's share price rose by ~150% in FY21, significantly ahead of Maersk at ~60% when measured in Euros and including dividends. At ~8x FY23e EV/EBITDA according to our estimates, Hapag-Lloyd is trading significantly above its pre-pandemic 2-year forward EV/EBITDA multiple range and while some premium to historical multiples might be justified due to the healthy freight rate outlook, the significant premium to Maersk, which is trading at ~3x FY23e EV/EBITDA, is not, in our view. ... and we prefer Maersk due to its higher share of contract rates ... As detailed in our sector note, we don't see spot freight rates returning to pre-pandemic levels. Nevertheless, we currently model a retreat from peak levels starting in FY22 and accelerating in FY23. Consensus FY23 EBITDA estimates for Hapag-Lloyd and Maersk expect a drop of roughly ~50% vs. FY21 levels for both companies, although Maersk has significantly higher share of contract rates which should offer some protection against the drop in spot rates. Consequently, our FY23 EBITDA estimate is 10% below current consensus estimates, while our FY23 EBITDA estimate for Maersk is 17% ahead of consensus estimates. ... and lack a clear vision of what to do with the pandemic windfall gain at Hapag- joy Lloyd sits We believe the recent CMD was a missed opportunity in terms of presenting a convincing strategy for the post-pandemic world order. While Maersk is using the extra cash to accelerate its ""integrator"" strategy, CMA CGM is creating the fourth-largest contract logistics company by adding Ingram Micro to its Ceva subsidiary (and buying one of the largest terminals in the US) and MSC is buying second-hand tonnage to overtake Maersk as the largest carrier, Hapag-Lloyd seems to be satisfied with distributing dividends.

AC FP,AC,Oct 28 2021 12:00AM,Accor,Hotels & Leisure,"Improving outlook, already priced-in ","We see Q3 revenue broadly in-line with expectations. As expected, RevPARaccelerated on a 2y view given the strength of the leisure demand during the summer season, although partly offset by the weakness in the Asia-Pacific region. The commentary for Q4 looks encouraging, with further improvement seen vs. Q3. Although the company improved its FY21 EBITDA sensitivity (per RevPAR point) and cash burn targets, we still expect (sell-side) consensus to adjust estimates downward. We thus see no reason to turn more constructive on the ","name, especially having in mind the demanding valuation with the stock trading at a premium to U.S peers. Sell rating. e@ Q3 RevPAR broadly in-line with expectations: RevPAR down 37% vs. Q3, broadly in-line with expectations, sharply accelerating vs. Q2 (-58% vs 2019). South Europe and IMEAT performed above average (-25% and -23% vs 2019, respectively), while Asia-Pacific underperformed (-57% vs. 2019) notably due to Australia. Encouraging RevPAR outlook: management commentary indicates sequential RevPAR trend improvement in Q4 vs. Q3. This should be particularly driven by Europe, notably benefiting from the return of transient business travel and a slight improvement in the MICE activity (mainly small group events at this stage). Australia should also contribute to the better trend with the country opening up while the summer season will start. We currently expect Q4 RevPAR 32% below 2019 (we suspect consensus to be broadly in-line). FY21 EBITDA sensitivity target improved: FY21 EBITDA sensitivity (per RevPAR point) now seen below €17m vs. below €18m before. This notably reflects the volumes improvement that starts to trigger incentive management fees for the management contracts. We understand this guidance already factored-in an improvement in Australia in the back-end of the year, though any stronger than expected rebound as part of the summer season could be a driver in our view to bring EBITDA sensitivity below €16m (in-line with H1). The operating leverage improvement should not surprise investors, and we still believe sell-side consensus could cut EBITDA estimates and move into negative territory (vs. current consensus EBITDA of €+8m). FY21 cash burn target improved: FY21 average monthly cash burn now seen at < €35m vs. €40m previously. It implies FY21 FCF of c.€-350m (broadly in-line with our estimates), o/w c.€-100m in H2. Similarly, we expect sell-side consensus to adjust FCF expectations downward (current VA consensus pointing to FY21 FCF of €-265m). NUG outlook - Gradual acceleration expected: net openings of c.7k rooms during the quarter (vs. c.5k rooms Q2 and c.4k rooms Q1). The pipeline has remained stable at c.211k rooms (c.27% of existing estate). The expected acceleration of conversion started to materialize in Q3, now representing c.45% of YTD openings vs. c.40% at the end of Q2. FY21 guidance points to c.3% NUG, implying an acceleration vs. +2.5% at the end of Q3.

SESL FP,SESL,Oct 29 2021 01:00AM,SES-imagotag,Europe Industrials,In line with expectations ,"Conclusion: SES-Imagotag reported Q3 sales that showed a growth constrainedby supply chain disruptions but share of VAS within revenue keeps expanding very fast which is rather good news for margins. Despite short-term headwinds with digitalization at the top of retailers’ agenda, we see no constraints on the demand side and foresee this strong underlying trend to fuel strong growth. ","Order entries stands at €651m on a 12 months rolling basis (€139m in Q3), a very good level. Sales growth constrained by supply chain disruptions. SES-Imagotag reported Q3 sales of €87m, up +19% (+51% to €290m over 9 months), hampered by the combined effects of the semiconductor shortage and the 4th wave of COVID-19, which paralyses Jabil's plant in Vietnam, and which is expected to return to normal during November. This slows down growth in the U.S. (Q3 RoW Sales up +1%, +14% over 9 months), a market that is initially addressed by Jabil to avoid customs duties on products from China. Therefore growth is mainly fueled by Europe (Q3 Europe Sales up +28%, +69% over months). Share of VAS within revenue to keep expanding. The good surprise comes from value-added services, which continue to grow at an impressive rate, already reaching 15% of sales over 9 months (c €44m) compared to 13.3% in H1 2021 (c €27m), i.e. an additional €17m recorded in Q3 alone, almost 20% of Q3 sales. This could partly offset the negative impact on margin of supply chain disruptions. Positive outlook for end of 2021 onwards. SES-imagotag confirms sales for FY 2021 to come at €400m (+38%) meaning a Q4 of €110m (+12%). Order entries of €651m on a 12 months rolling basis reinforces the prospect of strong growth in 2022 (or 2023 if supply chain disruptions also affects next year deliveries). To reach the €800m revenue guidance in 2023, order intake will have to exceed €800m by the end of 2022, which implies that the average order intake pace will have to be around €200m per quarter fairly quickly (from €651m c. +30% increase will be needed next year, which is not out of reach). Anew assembly line is currently being built in Mexico to better serve the U.S market, formerly addressed by the Jabil factory located in Vietnam. The factory could be up and running as soon as next year. We are keeping our conservative approach and therefore our estimates and our target price of €64 are unchanged at this stage and confirm our Buy rating.",Valentin-Paul Jahan,"Valentin-Paul Jahan, CFA",64,,Buy,,EUR,0.23,,1.17,,0,0,,,,,M,STIFEL_In line_FlashCoNote_Oct 29 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_In line_FlashCoNote_Oct 29 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=f5a99e4c-455a-4f0b-8fb3-d70aab4f7502&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

Profitability should continue to benefit from growth, particularly in higher-margin businesses, and from best practices learned from acquisitions. The combination with Helvetic Payroll (HP) could enable the group to reach €18m in EBIT (3% margin) by 2021. As areminder, freelance.com published a +60% increase in half-year turnover thanks to the integration of INOP's and a +15% increase in organic growth, driven in particular by a good complementarity of offers between INOP's and freelance.com. The EBITDA margin stood at 2.5% (vs 2.1% H1-20). However, the integration of investments in support functions (HR, IT, Marketing) necessary for the deployment of the development strategy and future growth led to an increase in amortisations. The EBIT margin therefore grew relatively more slowly at 2.1% (vs 2%). We reiterate our forecast of €622m of pro forma revenue in 2021, which includes 20% growth in umbrella services (including HP growth), 15% in the freelancing business and 5% in other activities. We also confirm our forecast of €18m of pro forma EBIT in 2021, by taking c.€9m EBIT for freelance.com and INOP's and €9m EBIT for HP (c.5% margin).

IFCN SW,IFCN,Dec 06 2021 12:40PM,Inficon,Technology Hardware,Innovation to support growth — little upside on valuation ,"Inficon held a Technology Day in its production facility in Balzers, Liechtensteinat end-November. e The day focused on existing and new products that should drive growth for the next couple of years. e Inficon is adding new innovations to its existing product lines which should allow for further market share gains in various end-markets. e Production capacity will be 50% higher in 2023. e Inficon still isn't providing any mid-term guidance or amibitions and we are not changing our estimates. e Shares look fairly valued at the moment. ","Technology Day: growth opportunities with existing and new products Inficon's Technology Day is usually not a day to discuss numbers but has a focus on the products Inficon has to offer. This year's day was focusing on new and updated products for all end-markets and was a proof of the innovation power that Inficon has to offer. We were impressed by the number of new products Inficon launches to the market and by the new markets it will tap with its new optical gas analyzers and coatings. Sum of all new innovations should support future growth While there were too innovations/new products that stood out for us, it is the sum of all presented products that will support Inficon's growth in the year to come and even give room for positive surprises. It is too early to tell, but we anticipate potential positive surprises from xParts coatings and ELT300 leak detection for battery cells. Strong demand from semis — production capacity clearly up The demand for all semiconductor-related products is still very high and Inficon is rather constrained by its own capacity than by its supply chain. To be able to cope with still increasing demand for its products and the increase in market share, Inficon will add 50% more capacity by 2023. This clearly also supports growth for the coming years. No update on numbers — no mid-term outlook — no change to our numbers After increasing its guidance for full-year 2021 with Q3 numbers, Inficon did not give an update on figures. The Technology Day was also not the event for the communication of mid-term financial ambitions but the impact of new products and the higher capacity should start to be felt in the next few years. We therefore see no reason to change our numbers for 2021 and 2022. Our revenue CAGR for 2021-25 remains at 8.6% and our EBIT assumption reaches a 20% peak in 2024. Shares fairly valued — more defensive character could start to be relevant but our case not changing yet In our view, the shares are fairly valued at the moment. The investment case does offer relative attractiveness in a more unsecure semiconductor environment, in our view.

","The Investor Day agenda is similar to previous Days. MTU has published the agenda for the Investor Day (which starts at 13:30 CEST), for which the presentations are on COVID 19 Crisis, Market Situation of Our Product Portfolio, Technology Roadmap / Cost Leadership, Financials / Outlook 2022, and an Executive Summary, before a Q&A Session. This is a fairly typical structure for MTU's Investor Days, which tend to look at the group holistically, rather than to provide a deep dive into one or other business, and which typically see initial guidance introduced for the following FY. The critical watch issue for us is commentary on AM / shop visit demand... Given that we believe that industry shop visit demand is increasing significantly, due to a reasonably good Northern Hemisphere summer flying season and deferred maintenance during the depths of the pandemic, we look for datapoints and anecdotal commentary from management about how they see real-time aftermarket (""AM"") and shop visit demand, and demand indicators for FY-22. ..Which was quite positive on MTU's 9M-21 Call... On the 9M-21 Results Call on Friday 29 October, management noted that all of MTU's Maintenance, Repair & Overhaul (""MRO"") shops ""Are seeing steep workload increases"", and that MTU expects Q4-21 Spares growth to be up ""in the 30% range"". What is, in our view, key, is the degree to which this demand strength carries over into FY-22. ..With likely significant global ASK growth being a key driver. We anticipate that gradually loosening travel restrictions (at least for the vaccinated) and greater recognition of vaccination status, plus pent-up demand are likely to see higher capacity flown in 2022. Deferred maintenance from the Q2-20 to Q3-21 period is likely to add a hard- to-quantify tailwind atop this. IATA forecasts a +25% increase in global available seat kilometres (""ASK"") in 2022 - but given that MTU's Spares revenues outperformed global ASK in FY-20 by 2900bp, due the the military F-117 (aka PW2000) engine, we expect that they are likely to underperform global ASK in FY-21 and FY-22, and we look for just +12% Spares $ revenue growth in FY-22, which would leave its Spares revenues at 87% of their FY-19 level. Initial FY-22 guidance is likely to be slightly sub-consensus. Current I/B/E/S FY-22 median consensus looks for €4,880m of sales (implying 12% y/y growth), €595m of ""EBIT Adjusted"" (implying a 12.2% margin, up +180bp y/y), and €279m of Free Cashflow (implying a cash conversion ratio of 66% of ""Net Income Adjusted""). We expect that MTU's initial FY-22 guidance is likely to be slightly below this level, as management prefer to guide conservatively. Over the last 5 years pre-coronavirus, so from FY-15 to FY-19 inclusive, MTU beat its initial ""EBIT Adjusted"" guidance by a mean 7%. Above-consensus EPS estimates unchanged. Our “Adjusted EPS” estimates are €6.20 for 2021E (unchanged vs €6.20 previously) and €8.30 for 2022E (unchanged vs €8.30 previously). They are +6% / +4% above current I/B/E/S median consensus of €5.86 (FY-21) and €7.98 (FY-22).",Harry Breach,Harry Breach,240,,Buy,,EUR,6.2,,8.3,,2,2.5,,,,,M,STIFEL_Investor Day_FlashCoNote_Nov 17 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Investor Day_FlashCoNote_Nov 17 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=c0fe2a23-c4f9-4ff9-8dfe-7713c461c648&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
EDEN FP,EDEN,Dec 15 2021 01:00AM,Edenred,Business Services,Investor meetings feedback - Reiterating Buy rating ,"We reiterate our Buy rating following the virtual roadshow we hosted with Nordicinvestors over the last two days. Key topics discussed were top-line growth momentum, post-pandemic opportunities, competitive environment and M&A strategy. The stock de-rated below pre-pandemic multiples on the back of recent sector payment weakness, in our view offering an attractive entry point as it is trading on c.24.5x P/E for a projected three-year double-digit earnings CAGR. ","Key takeaways from investor meetings Recent trends confirmed the positive momentum: operating revenue growth accelerated in Q3 (c.+13% vs. c.+10% H1), driven by all business lines and regions, and by the reopening and continued strong commercial dynamics. Most recent trends confirmed this positive general momentum. Interestingly, Brazil showed signs of improvement in the second part of Q3 while Hispanic LatAm was still volatile. We still note recent mobility trends point to an improvement in Q4 across both Brazil and Mexico (figure 3-4). Commentary on the Christmas season for the gift voucher solution in Europe was also positive (gift vouchers c.15% of Q4 operating revenue). 'Virtual canteen’ opportunities materializing: Working From Home (WFH) brought an additional tailwind to accelerate meal voucher penetration. In that sense, we think the company's innovation strategy constitutes a competitive advantage (e.g. partnerships with 160 meal-delivery platforms). Around 300 contracts coming from the shift from ‘physical canteen’ have been signed globally over the past 12 months and further opportunities lie ahead, in our view. We discussed this topic previously (see our Jan-21 report), estimating potential for c.5% additional revenue at the group level from WFH. ‘Beyond fuel’ strategy to sustain Fleet & Mobility growth: this strategy brought particular traction in Brazil so far, especially from the maintenance solution. The plan is now to roll it out in the rest of LatAm. A similar plan is deployed in Europe. Overall, this contributes to acceleration in market penetration, a gain min arket share, cross-selling opportunities and improvement in client retention. e@ No change seen in competitive environment: this has been a widely discussed topic reflecting the recent noise around Swile in France. We believe the message remains consistent, with no disruption to the business model coming from this new entrant, no pressure seen on the take-up rate and no impact on Edenred's growth path. The company won c.1pt of market share p.a. over the last four years. Its market share stands at c.40% (vs. < 10% for Swile, SFe) or c.60% share of the digital market. M&A part of the roadmap, but Edenred remains disciplined: M&A firepower is seen at up to €1.5bn and commentary points to a good pipeline. The strategy is to further consolidate existing markets in Employee Benefits, to build position in Fleet & Mobility notably through the 'beyond fuel’ strategy, while in corporate payment the focus remains on accelerating the US penetration. Valuation multiples in this market have expanded significantly during the pandemic, and the company passed on several deals recently, confirming its disciplined track record. Attractive entry point following recent significant underperformance The stock has been impacted by the sector payment weakness, though we see no fundamental read-across for Edenred from the concerns surrounding the payment industry. Share price performance has been ""decorrelated"" from the recent positive earnings momentum. Valuation multiples now stand below the pre-pandemic level at c.24.5x FY22E P/E (vs. c.30x 2019), which we find attractive given our estimate of a mid-teens EPS CAGR in the next three years.",Simon Lechipre,"Simon Lechipre, CFA;Nicolas Tabor",58,,Buy,,EUR,1.36,,1.58,,0.86,0.87,,,,,M,STIFEL_Investor meetings_CoNote_Dec 15 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Investor meetings_CoNote_Dec 15 2021 01-00AM,EVENT FEEDBACK,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=269ead10-dd17-432c-b3fc-03d5b3257390&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
KARN SW,KARN,Nov 23 2021 01:00AM,Kardex Holding AG,Industrials,Kardex CMD - more ambitious targets ,"Ahead of today's CMD, Kardex specified and increased its long-term financial targets(midpoint sales expectation up by 150bp, significant higher operational profit). This should be positively received by the market. Despite this increase, we expect that these new targets will be significantly exceeded, at least in the short term (SFe sales growth FY-21-23 14% p.a., EBIT margin >14%). The strong expected growth is mainly driven by the significant pent-up demand for efficient intralogistics solutions. We expect structural growth to continue due to the low penetration rates for automation. The trend toward local warehouses in the supply chain also offers additional opportunities. ","New targets out: Kardex's management expects to grow at an annual growth rate over the cycle by between 5-7% (previous formulation 4-5% p.a.). With regard to operational profitability (EBIT-margin), Remstar now expects a range of 14-17% (old 8-16%), while Mlog is aiming for 5-8% (old 4-8%). All these goals apply as well over a business cycle. For the group, Kardex expects an EBIT margin from 10-14% (old >6%). The newly launched “product kids” should make a profit contribution from 2023 onwards (SFe e.g. AutoStore’s segment EBIT margin to be around the middle of that of Remstar and Mlog; at c.10%). Strong momentum: Kardex currently benefits from the significant pent-up demand for efficient intralogistics solutions (SFe FY-21 sales yoy +21%, EBIT yoy +9%, implied margin 13.3%). Its high returns on capital (e.g., ROCE FY-20 40.9%) illustrate its enviable competitive position and a considerable “moat” (particularly for the Remstar division, market share >35%). Agenda: 9Yam-2pm: Visit of Kardex products (e.g. vertical buffer module, LR35) at the premises of its customer Pilatus Flugzeugwerke AG in Stans/NW and a look at recent investments (Robomotive, Rocket Solution, Autostore).",Alexander Koller,Alexander Koller;Tobias Fahrenholz,300,,Buy,,EUR,6.17,,7.54,,3.98,4.29,,,,,M,STIFEL_Kardex CMD_FlashCoNote_Nov 23 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Kardex CMD_FlashCoNote_Nov 23 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=b09a2af3-a8a3-40f6-8b5b-4f69c2aa1223&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
DMP GY,DMP,Nov 16 2021 02:51AM,Dermapharm SE,Pharmaceuticals,Key earnings drivers showing strong momentum ,"Dermapharm reported 9M 2021 financial results this morning, which confirm ourpositive view on the group's earnings growth momentum, particularly driven by its largest and most profitable Branded Pharmaceuticals segment. Group revenues increased by 16.1% yoy after 9M 2021 with a strongly over-proportional growth in adj. EBITDA of 63.9% yoy. 9M 2021 group revenues missed our and consensus estimates by c.1%, while adj. EBITDA exceeded our and consensus expectations by 2-3% (and EPS even by 9-10%). Management lowered its FY 2021 guidance for group revenue growth to 15% to 20% (was 24% to 26%) and raised its guidance for group adj. EBITDA growth to 50% to 60% (up from 45% to 50% previously). We attribute the lower revenue guidance almost entirely to the parallel import business, which was declining by 7.5% yoy in 9M 2021 due to regulatory headwinds in Germany. On the other hand, Dermapharm's Branded Pharmaceuticals segment showed 33% yoy revenue growth and 73% yoy adj. EBITDA growth after 9M 2021, driven by a ramp-up in vaccine sales to BioNTech but also by products to strengthen the immune system (e.g. Vit D) and Allergopharma.

VOW3 GY,VOW3,Oct 25 2021 01:00AM,Volkswagen AG,Automotive,Lamborghini: ready to pass Ferrari? ,"It's not VW's biggest brand but the most profitable and the fastest growingone. Lamborghini hosted a CMD and provided insights into financials, product strategy, technology. Lamborghini's CEO Winkelmann, CFO Poma, and Audi CFO Rittersberger presented. The event confirmed our view: Lamborghini is now in striking distance of Ferrari in terms of profitability, and it is in the lead in terms of 'EV readiness’. Lamborghini is highly undervalued as part of VW Group, in our view. We think the best way to unlock value would be to partially separate Lamborghini. That seems unlikely for the time being. However, management plans to increase transparency going forward. We think this should help to unlock some value of this >EUR10bn asset. ","Financials: Lamborghini only started providing revenues a few years ago. Regarding profitability, management did not provide details so far. Now, management stated that Lamborghini was clearly unprofitable in 2001, >15% margin in 2020 and towards 20% margin in 2021. The operating margin in H1 2021 increased by 4.6%-points y-o-y (see Figure 4). In September, we published a report on Lamborghini and estimated that Lamborghini has a 20% EBIT margin. If we applied the 2021 Ferrari EV/EBIT multiple of 34x, Lamborghini could be worth up to EUR13bn, i.e. EUR25 per VW share. More transparency, higher multiples: From 2022 onwards, Lamborghini will report revenues and EBIT on a quarterly basis. The brand will also provide strategic long- term targets. We still believe that a partial IPO is a long-term option, especially if the valuation of VW continues to ignore assets like Porsche, Lamborghini, Bentley and Ducati. However, short term, this seems not on the agenda. Increased transparency should help to unlock value. It should also increase pressure on management to evaluate more options. VW has clearly not delivered on its promise to optimize the business portfolio (‘Group Initiative 13' under the Strategy 2025 plan). Instead of selling assets, VW bought Europcar, Gotion, Navistar. The only bigger divestment so far was a 10% stake in Traton - a disappointing result. Outstanding brand: Lamborghini's Chief Marketing & Sales officer Foschini highlighted that Lamborghini is leading in social media and in eSports. The customers are relatively young compared to peers (45 years for the Huracan, 46 years for the Urus and 48 years for the Aventador). This is crucial: Lamborghini benefits from the scale effects of VW Group; however, the popularity of the brand shows that Lamborghini's image is not suffering from the fact that is not a stand-alone company like Ferrari. Importance of scale increases: CTO Reggiani laid out the electrification strategy. In 2023 Lamborghini plans to launch its first hybrid vehicle. The brand will invest >EUR1.6bn over four years (a lot for a company that generated EUR1.6bn in revenues in 2020). A BEV is slated to be launched in the second half of the decade. The announcement itself is not different from what other sports car brands are planning. However, the access to VW's technologies make these targets very credible, in our opinion. Lamborghini has access to the same technologies and can share cost with Porsche and Bentley. Lamborghini's closest peer is Ferrari. However, in contrast to Ferrari, Lamborghini already proved that the brand can sell SUVs. In contrast to Ferrari, Porsche already proved it can sell electric sports cars. There will always be advantages of being part of a large group on the one side or being an independent company on the other side. However, we argue electrification and digitalization clearly make life more difficult for smaller companies. Lamborghini seems uniquely positioned: brand strength and agility of a small company, scale effects of a 10m units group.",Daniel Schwarz,"Daniel Schwarz;Pierre-Yves Quémeéner;Alexander Wahl, CFA",312,,Buy,,EUR,30.4,,35.4,,8.5,10.6,,,,,M,STIFEL_Lamborghini- ready_CoNote_Oct 25 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Lamborghini- ready_CoNote_Oct 25 2021 01-00AM,EVENT FEEDBACK,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=a008f8a4-3372-4e0f-84a8-212141f4f2d6&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
A2A IM,A2A,Nov 11 2021 12:41PM,A2A,Utilities,Limited impact from surging power prices on Q3-21 results ,A2A's Q3-9M-21 results were in line with our and consensus estimates. Q3-21,"EBITDA increased by 2% y/y and net profit declined by 17%. As we anticipated, several headwinds penalized EBITDA in the power generation business in Q3, while hedged volumes did not allow the company to fully exploit the favourable power generation scenario. Power generation EBITDA declined by 30% versus Q3-20, penalized by gas procurement costs, power volumes acquired at market price and rising concession fees for hydro plants. The waste business benfited from high power prices and increasing treated volumes, while EBITDA in the market business declined y/y. Net debt increased by 9% versus end 2020, mainly driven by capex acceleration, M&A and dividend payments in the period. A2A's management increased 2021 EBITDA guidance to €1.32-1.34bn, from €1.27-1.30bn. We confirm our Hold rating on the stock. In our opinion, A2A's share price has quickly incorporated the new scenario of high power prices in the Italian market. Assuming a normalization of gas prices and consequently of Italian power prices as of 2023, we struggle to justify further significant upside in the share price versus the current level. In our opinion, A2A’s business plan also offers execution risk in terms of capital allocation due to its strategy aimed at building a large position in renewable power generation capacity. Our detailed breakdown of Q3-21 results are as follows: EBITDA increased by 2% y/y to €269m (in line with our €264m estimate): 1) as we anticipated, EBITDA in the power generation business declined by 30% y/y to €53m. The positive impact on hydro margins from high power prices (which tripled versus Q3-20) were mitigated by the company's hedging policy and weak hydro volumes in the quarter. Negative impact on EBITDA resulted from high gas procurement costs, pressure on margins from power volumes acquired in the spot market and rising fees for hydro concessions; 2) the negative performance in the power generation business was offset by the positive performance from: a) the network division, where EBITDA increased by 27% y/y to €107m (better than expected), mainly driven by the consolidation of Aeb-Gelsia; and b) the waste business, where EBITDA increased by 10% y/ly to €74m, mainly due to rising volumes treated and the positive impact on WTE margins from high power prices. EBITDA in the market division declined by 17% y/y to €35m (lower than expected), mainly due to pressure on electricity margins from high power procurement costs. Net profit declined by 17% y/y to €54m. It was higher than our €45m estimate mainly due to a better than expected tax rate. Investments continued the acceleration reported in the previous quarters. Capex in Q3-21 increased by 39% y/y to €227m. Capex increased by 55% y/y in 9M-21 to €640m. The company confirmed guidance of €1.0bn for the FY-21. Net debt increased by 9% versus the end of 2020 to €3.78bn (in line with our estimate), mainly driven by capex acceleration, M&A and dividend payments in the period. A2A's management increased the 2021 EBITDA guidance to €1.32-1.34bn, from €1.27-1.30bn. We understand that the increase is mainly due to the high power price scenario, despite the hedging level for 2021 being at 100%. So far, around 55% of 2022 higher production has been hedged at €71/MWh, versus the average of around €50/MWh achieved in 2021.",Enrico Bartoli,Enrico Bartoli,1.77,,Hold,,EUR,0.11,,0.13,,0.08,0.09,,,,,M,STIFEL_Limited impact_FlashCoNote_Nov 11 2021 12-41PM.pdf,STIFEL_Limited impact_FlashCoNote_Nov 11 2021 12-41PM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=9b2ec76c-accd-4fef-9cd2-1bcadb17ff36&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
LDO IM,LDO,Nov 10 2021 01:00AM,Leonardo SpA,Aerospace & Defence,Looking Beyond Aerostructures ,"We reiterate our Buy rating and €10.50 price target (implying a +62% TSR)on Leonardo shares, nudge up our FY-21 EPS estimate (mainly due to non- operational reasons), and retain our above-consensus estimates for FY-22 and beyond. We also include an ESG Assessment in this note. e We view the figures for Q3-21 as fine overall (as reviewed in our prior note). They featured EBITA which hit consensus, a wide Free Operating Cashflow (""FOCF"") beat, unchanged guidance that appears to us to be realistic (and which is in-line with consensus), and its ATR and Space businesses are clearly delivering improving performances. Even its Aerostructures business booked a loss that was insignificantly worse, despite much lower 787 shipset deliveries, its expected FY-21 cash outflow was unchanged, and, we hope, the FY-25 breakeven target is well-achievable. However, there were no new indications on the timing of the postponed IPO of DRS, its US defence electronics business, or of other disposals. e They are a small positive for our thesis that Leonardo is a revenue, cash flow and re-rating story at near-bottom-of-the-sector multiples (with minimal risk of an equity increase). The cashflow story benefits from 3Q performance and the CEO's repeated commitment to cumulative 2021-2025 FOCF of ~€3.3bn. e YTD, Leonardo shares are up +11%, vs +25% for the MIB 40 and +17% for the Stoxx A&D. It trades at or close to the bottom of European A&D on most metrics, though at the lower-middle on FCF multiples, which we see as significantly over-discounted, given likely strong EPS (with a FY-20 to FY-23 CAGR of 53% from a depressed FY-20 base) and FCF recovery over the medium term, as well as deleveraging via disposals. ","EPS Estimate Nudged Up for FY-21 Our EPS estimates are €0.95 for 2021E (up 5% vs €0.90 previously, due to non-operating items), and €1.30 in 2022E (unchanged). These are +5% / +8% above current |/B/E/S median consensus of €0.90 and €1.20 respectively. Price Target Unchanged Our €10.50 PT (based on a target 2023 P/E Relative of 56% vs the MIB 40 index) is unchanged. It implies that in one year's time, Leonardo shares could trade at 7x FY 23E EPS, which implies moderate multiple expansion vs their current 5x FY-22E EPS, but which is still materially below their last 10-year mean of 9x. €10.50 implies a Total Shareholder Return of +62% from current levels (including an estimated FY-21E dividend per share of €0. 0).

VAR1 GY,VAR1,Nov 12 2021 01:00AM,VARTA AG,Technology Hardware,Lost in Transition: CoinPower saw its peak and V4Drive future is based on hope ,"Q3 results came in weak and the short- and medium-term outlooks are furthersetbacks for the story. e On the back of the reduced outlook, declining ASP and muted capacity comments, we cut our respective 21E, 22E and 23E adj. EBITDA by 10%, 29% and 35%. e Due to the dimmer outlook and our adjusted modelling, we cut our price target to €76 and reiterate our Sell rating. ","CoinPower capacity potentially close to its peak We believe that VARTA's CoinPower business is close to its peak and adjust our model accordingly. Initially, we modelled a peak of 450m cells by the end of 2025E as our last highly detailed estimate year. We now model stable 210m cells by the end of 2021E, 250m cells by the end of 2022E and going forward. Furthermore, after VARTA was substituted in Beats earbuds and potentially also in Samsung and Jabra, we believe Apple will account for 80% to 90% of VARTA's CoinPower revenues. As Mic-Power produces at lower costs than VARTA, we would also assume that Apple increases its pressure on ASPs heavily, beyond the levels we have seen so far. We saw €1 ASP indications from EVE Energy coin cell. We still believe that below €1.30, VARTA will post EBIT losses, and below €1.00, the business will be cash negative. Hence, with alternatives on hand, Apple is able to significantly increase its pressure, particularly as there seems to be limited interest in VARTA's A4 generation. In our view, this could lead to a near-complete collapse of VARTA's CoinPower business in a disadvantageous bear case scenario. For now, we only adjust 2021E ASPs and our capacity going forward significantly; however, we still see further headwind potential. We cut adj. EBITDA estimates for 2021E, 2022E and 2023E by 10%, 29% and 35%, respectively. EV-case still a black box, but up to 30% EBITDA margin possible We still don't know much about the economics around VARTA's V4Drive cell, but from the CMD we know that VARTA is aiming at a 10GWh production or more going forward. This bodes quite well with our estimate of €1bn revenues by 2030 at a reasonable mark-up of around 20% to costs per kWh that are currently around €100. Furthermore, assuming a similar personnel intensity and double the material intensity per revenue unit compared with CoinPower, we believe EBITDA margins of up to 30% are possible. Hence, we conclude that the V4Drive business' margin should land somewhere between 20% and 30%. Backed by that information, we increase our margin estimate by 5pp from 22% to 27% in the mid-term. From the information we have for now, we see only limited upside risk to our current model; however, information on the business is still in short-supply. For this particular reason, we still doubt that significant projects are already finalised, but that the high-energy cell is actually in a rather early stage. Sell rating confirmed and price target cut to €76 (€97) We still conclude that the risk outweighs the opportunities for VARTA going forward. In our view, the threat to the CoinPower business is still not fully appreciated by the market, while the fantasy is that the EV business prices in opportunities that are not reflected by the EV-market nor company communication. We value VARTA with a DCF analysis using 1.3 beta, a 2% terminal growth rate and a WACC of 7.5%; this results in our €76 price target. The cut is due to short- to medium-term cuts in our estimates.

HLE GY,HLE,Nov 30 2021 01:00AM,Hella,Automotive Supplier,"Lower volumes, higher costs - but that's a minor matter ","We cut our group adj. EBIT estimates by c20%/9%/8.5% for FY22-24 as we lowervolumes and higher costs. @ Operational performance remains a minor matter as investors meanwhile discount a potential squeeze-out scenario following a 12-month cool-off period. For this reason, we leave our €60 price target unchanged and reiterate Hold. ","Prelmiminary F2Q22 results and guidance cut HLE released preliminary F2Q22 (September-November) results with group revenues of c€1.5bn (-13% y/y; SFe: €1.47bn) and group adj. EBIT of c€60m (4% margin; SFe: €51m/3.5% margin). It also followed suit its new owner, Faurecia, and revised its outlook for FY22 for FX and portfolio adj. group revenues to €5.9-6.2bn (was €6-6.5bn) and adj. EBIT margin to 3.5-5.0% (was 5.0-7.0%) largely to reflect a weaker volume recovery in its F2H22 (December-May) and accelerating cost headwinds. Key takeaways from the conference call Volume outlook: Management considers current IHS forecasts for FY22 (74.7m units) the bluesky scenario and sees FY22 LV production in a range of 71-75m units with F4Q22 volumes roughly at the same level as F3Q22 (18.3m). This is mainly a reflection of persistently tight supply of semiconductor components and accordingly reduced volume recovery expectations in HLE's F2H22 (December 21-May 22). While Faurecia's guidance cut (note) provided limited implications for calendar 2022, we think HLE's statements imply that current IHS projections for calendar 1H22 (39.9m units) are c5-6% too high and production could drop c5% y/y in calendar 1H22. Costs keep rising but constructive on OEM reimbursements: HLE indicated that the excess cost run rate has meanwhile risen to cCE20m per month in the last quarter and is further rising. Management is optimistic they will receive compensation for higher input costs (mainly referring to semiconductor components) from OEMs and we understand that agreements for FY21 are close to signing. Yet, HLE does not expect a major financial benefit during its current FY, i.e. before June 2022. This is also a cross-read for other suppliers, which aim to receive similar reimbursements. FCF likely to be negative this year, more reluctant on mid-term margin targets: Management also outlined that FY22 FCF is unlikely to end in positive territory (current Refinitiv consensus still at €150m) due to lower earnings, higher inventories, limited leeway to cut on capex and high project related R&D costs. Moreover, CEO Breidenbach was rather reluctant to provide an outright confirmation of the 8-9% mid-term margin ambition, saying that due to more severe cost pressures, the 8% threshold would be more ambitious but still achievable.

SW FP,SW,Nov 04 2021 02:00AM,Sodexo,Business Services,Management meeting feedback ,"We attended a sell-side meeting hosted by Chairwoman & interim CEO SophieBellon and CFO Marc Rolland. Management notably displayed a confident message on sustainable growth acceleration. Other key topics discussed were the ongoing strategic review of BRS, the key challenges to address for the upcoming CEO, the labor cost inflation, and an update on the portfolio management strategy. We adjust our estimates following FY20/21 results and keep our €78 PT unchanged. We maintain our Hold rating. The strategy has produced little effect on retention rate and development at this stage, while we see downside risk on demanding consensus expectations. Relative valuation leaves little upside. ","Key takeaways from management meeting Top-line guidance discussion: the 15/18% y/y organic growth target implies FY21/22 revenues at c.95% of pre-pandemic levels (vs. 87% Q4-20/21). Expectations point to a significant sequential step-up in Q1 (Sept-Nov), and a more gradual improvement thereafter. Healthcare and Schools should improve above 2019 levels, while corporate services, sports & leisure and universities should remain below. Some pricing effect is included in the guidance, reflecting inflation. Benefits & Rewards strategic review: the aim of the ongoing review is to accelerate growth through the diversification of the business and the deployment of new activities/services. A potential partnership would enable to execute more rapidly, bringing additional competencies in the related business areas but also additional human and financial resources. Management believes the diversification strategy led by Edenred has been the key reason for the outperformance over the last few years. Retention rate - Inflection not yet reached: retention rate has not improved over the last few years, and this is thus still the key topic to address. Management believes this is more a matter of execution and process, rather than any strategic changes to implement. The encouraging trends recently seen in North America give management confidence on an inflection point to occur in due course with a strengthening of the execution and a roll-out of the initiatives already implemented. e@ New CEO still expected by year-end: the expectations from the Chairwoman regarding the upcoming new CEO are notably; 1) to implement a more rigorous culture and to raise the requirements across the teams; 2) to scale-up the initiatives implemented under previous CEO; 3) to develop an ambitious strategy over the mid- to long-term. Labour cost inflation - Confident message: it is particularly seen in North America (mid-single % impact), while ebbing softer in other regions. CFO is confident on protecting margins thanks to the structure of the contracts and also helped by the ongoing renegotiation with clients. Supply chain bottlenecks recently started to impact the North America business, although remaining manageable at this stage. Active portfolio management continuing: management is pleased with what has been done so far, notably in terms of the reduction of the perimeter, though they could still exit few additional countries (< 5). The portfolio strategy should still be pursued with some non-core activities to be review in countries that will remain in the perimeter.

ELE SM,ELE,Nov 26 2021 01:21AM,Endesa,Utilities,Margin expansion included in Endesa's new business plan offers limited visibility ,"Endesa raised EBITDA targets in its new business plan, mainly on expectationsof significant expansion of integrated electricity margins. e We prefer to take a more cautious stance than the company on margins evolution, and we continue to include the impact from CO2 claw-back in our estimates. e Operating targets for 2024 are achievable, in our opinion, but most of the medium-term growth is expected in 2025-30. e@ We confirm our Hold rating on the stock. We expect the perception of regualtory risk for Spanish integrated utilities to continue. ","Expansion of integrated margins is the main driver of target improvement in Endesa's new business plan The main take from Endesa's new 2021-24 business plan is, in our opinion, represented by the expansion of integrated electricity margins that the company forecasts as of 2023. This is the main driver of the 5% increase in the EBITDA target for 2023 versus the previous plan, and the additional growth in EBITDA expected in 2024. The 3-year capex plan was reduced by 5% to €7.5bn, mainly due to the higher contribution to renewable capacity additions from solar PV plants. We take a more cautious stance on margins evolution than Endesa's targets Endesa forecasts that electricity integrated margins would increase by 30% versus both 2021 and the level on which the 2023 EBITDA target was based in the previous business plan. We prefer to take a more cautious stance on margin evolution. We also continue to include the impact from the CO, claw-back in our estimates, even though the company is confident that its nuclear and hydro production will be deemed exempt from its application. Our 2022-24 estimates are on average 9% lower than the company's targets. The 2021-30 capex plan is mainly back-end loaded Endesa updated its medium-term strategy targets for 2030. The company plans to invest €31bn in 2021-30. We calculate that the 2030 capex plan is significantly back-end loaded: 1) Around 70% of capex will be spent beyond 2024; 2) 12GW of new renewable capacity out of 16GW is expected to be installed in 2025-30; 3) RAB in the electricity distribution business is expected to remain flat till 2024, and to grow only in 2025-30. We reiterate our Hold rating on the stock In our opinion, the recent regulatory changes announced by the Spanish government have significantly increased regulatory risk for utilities in the Spanish market. However, even though Endesa will not be affected by the gas claw-back measures, and, as the company anticipated, it could be also exempt from the application of the CO2 claw-back, we think that the perception of high regulatory risk in the Spanish market will remain. We think that the way the Spanish government handled the sharp rise in power prices reduced overall confidence in the country's regulatory stability. The implementation of further unexpected measures, in case the current high level of power prices last longer than currently indicated by the forward curves, cannot be ruled out, in our view. Our price target remains unchanged at €21.30 per share. The exemption of Endesa's hydro and nuclear production from the COz2 claw-back would result in €1.00 per share upside pressure to our valuation.",Enrico Bartoli,Enrico Bartoli,21.3,,Hold,,EUR,1.49,,1.5,,1.3,1.05,,,,,M,STIFEL_Margin expansion_CoNote_Nov 26 2021 01-21AM.pdf,STIFEL_Margin expansion_CoNote_Nov 26 2021 01-21AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=a14ac102-a1d4-4b0f-b62b-22ec164f1b76&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
EMMN SW,EMMN,Nov 11 2021 01:28AM,Emmi,Food & Beverage,Market timing - now is a good time to Buy ," We upgrade the stock based on (1) the significant seasonality pattern of the stock,(2) the recently confirmed compelling defensive growth strategy and (3) the defensive characteristics of the stock. e@ The share price consolidation post H1, and our positive ESG assessment adds to the stock's attractiveness. e@ We acknowledge the cost and demand headwinds (in CH) but point out EMMN’s track record to deal with adverse market conditions thanks to its agile organisation. e@ We tweak our numbers slightly and include the Athenos acquisition. e Our price target moves up to CHF 1,120 from CHF 1,050. ","Investment case update — more of the same. EMMN’s defensive growth case nurtured by fast growing niches (Café Latte, goat cheese, Italian desserts) that lift gross and EBIT margin over time is well known by the market. The recently announced acquisition of Athenos underscores the strategic continuity. With that defensive growth profile, highly perceived by investors who are willing to pay a premium valuation, we consider EMMN an attractive stock to own from an underlying operational standpoint. Currently, EMMN faces input cost pressures, as well as reversal effects in its Swiss business (45% of sales), post Covid. Consequently, management remains cautious (even more than usually) looking into FY-22. Nevertheless, cost pressure (with a limited pricing power in core dairy products in CH) has been an ongoing topic for EMMN in the past. The company has shown that its organisation is able to find ways to offset these costs, and we therefore expect Emmi to reach its guidance and achieve a further EBIT margin improvement of 10bps in FY-22 (we modeled a flat margin before). Reasons for our positive view. (1) The share price has seen a good performance in the first half of the year and climbed further after EMMN lifted guidance on the back of an impressive OG of 3.6% in H1. Since then, the share price has seen a decline of 10.5% from the highs. Looking at the past five years, EMMN has established a significant seasonality pattern with Nov, Dec and Jan being the best months (1.5%/2.0%/8.0% per month) on average. We believe, this can be explained by the company’s typical conservative management of expectations resulting in high hopes for the sales release in January. The headwinds in the Swiss business (more cross-border tourism, lost milk supply contracts) and cost headwinds pose a risk but are known by the market and EMMN has shown in the past that its agile organisation can deal with such challenges. (2) the Athenos acquisition announced in September confirms Emmi's compelling defensive growth strategy and investors know what they get. (3) Finally, EMMN could benefit from its defensive stock characteristics when bad news around interest rates or re-surging Covid cases may hit the market towards the year-end. Changes to our numbers. We tweak our estimates slightly, reflecting the high organic growth of peers shown in Q3 and additional growth stemming from the Athenos acquisition. In total, our EPS changes by +0.3%/+3.7%/+4.6% for FY-21-23E ESG. We assessed Emmi across the three aspects of ESG and found solid results for all three areas. We'd like to highlight Emmi’s GHG emission targets, which exceed those of peers in terms of size and timeline. Further, we like the company’s solid corporate governance structure with a trust building management and a down-to-earth culture. Though, not the primary driver behind our upgrade, we consider ESG as supportive to our case. Valuation and catalysts. Our valuation approach uses 50% DCF (5.5% WACC, 0.8 beta and 1.5% LTG) and 50% EV/EBITDA 22E multiple, which combined yields a price target of CHF 1,120.

IRE IM,IRE,Nov 19 2021 01:00AM,Iren,Utilities,Meetings with investors confirmed Iren's low-risk growth story ,"We organized some meetings with investors for lren's management, who provideddetails on the business plan presented last week. Meetings confirmed our view that Iren's new business plan is ambitious, but it offers reasonable visibility on high single-digit growth potential at EBITDA and net profit level. Iren's CEO, Mr. Armani, highlighted that organic growth in the company's traditional businesses is supported by a detailed list of projects. Additionally, the €12.7bn capex plan targeted for 2021-30 is backed by additional €1.8bn of projects, which would provide flexibility in achieving the targets. Development of renewable capacity is not easy in the Italian market, but the possible acquisition of 1GW project pipeline would improve visibility on the target of reaching 0.5GW of solar and wind capacity by 2026. ","We confirm our Buy rating on the stock. We think that the new business plan restored confidence in lIren's low-risk value creation story after the recent change in management. It also provided visibility on the additional value-creation potential offered by the company in its businesses linked to the circular economy and on cautious development of renewable power generation capacity. The stock trades at attractive multiples, in our opinion, despite the positive performance of the share price in the past weeks. The main points emerged from the meetings are the following: e@ lren's management is confident to deliver the business plant targets both in terms of economics and execution of investments. Projects in lren's traditional businesses (networks and waste) expected to drive EBITDA growth are fully identified. Contribution from new waste treatment plants is expected to accelerate by 2024, being the majority of new capacity already authorized. Investments in those businesses will be focused on Iren's core territories, where the company can exploit deep knowledge of the markets. lren's CEO confirmed a cautious approach to the development of renewable capacity. Capacity targets in the business plan (0.5GW in 2026, 2.2GW in 2030) are mainly based on organic development of greenfield projects. No intention to acquire already operating plants has been confirmed. We understand that Iren is in advanced stage of negotiation for acquiring a 1GW pipeline, including projects close to complete their authorization process. Limited impact is expected from the ongoing regulatory review on WACC. The impact on 2022 EBITDA in electricity and gas distribution from a 80bps reduction in WACC would be almost fully recovered in 2023 thanks to growth in RAB driven by investments and inflation adjustment. The impact from a 50bps reduction in the return allowed to water distribution is expected to be almost fully offset by RAB growth and cost efficiencies. The current forward power prices are expected to provide upside pressure on power generation margins in 2022. The company has already hedged around 80% of its hydro and WTE power production for 2022 at an average price of €95/MWh, which compares with around €50/MWh hedged in 2021. The negative impact from high power and gas prices on supply margins reported in Q3-21 and expected to continue in Q4, would be at least partially offset in 2022 thanks to the renegotiation of supply contracts with liberalized clients. The business plan targets include contribution from gas tenders in the company's core areas. According to Iren's management, in those areas, public authorities are expected to call tenders earlier than in other Italian regions. The award of new gas distribution concessions would provide upside pressure to our estimates.",Enrico Bartoli,Enrico Bartoli,3.5,,Buy,,EUR,0.2,,0.23,,0.1,0.11,,,,,M,STIFEL_Meetings with_FlashCoNote_Nov 19 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Meetings with_FlashCoNote_Nov 19 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=329757c9-2ade-4685-85c5-7b322e24047e&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

New bank credit lines already negotiated could potentially be made available to the group, allowing it to pursue its build-up strategy. ","In addition to the issuance of 7.5m shares, to finance the cash payment of the acquisition, the group has raised approximately €100m in debt (from a banking pool for €90m and BPI for €10m) for a net debt that stands at €47m to date. We expect leverage of 1.9x at the end of 2021. Given that the company could go to a leverage of 3x and that we expect €28m of EBITDA in 2022, we believe the company could raise around €50m of additional debt during the next 12 months to continue its external growth strategy. The company has stated that it has already negotiated credit lines available. We expect that the next deal could be as early as 2022. The company is primarily looking for targets in European countries not yet addressed by Freelance.com to truly deploy its strategy of becoming a European leader.

Furthermore, we expect large deals/volumes to move to S/4HANA Cloud in 4Q, resulting in a bounce in S/4HANA Current Cloud Backlog, which should alleviate investors' concerns on the pace of business model transition at SAP. e@ 3Q22 revenue grew by 26% y/y in CC (2Q22/3Q21: 21% / 19% y/y) to $6.86bn, vs. Bloomberg cons at $6.80bn. Remaining Performance Obligation rose 20% y/y in 3Q (vs. 18% / 17% in 2Q22/3Q21) to c.$36.3bn. Current Remaining Performance Obligation, which is all the future revenue that is under contract and is expected to be recognised as revenue in the next 12 months, was c.$18.8bn, up 23% y/y (2Q22: 23% yly). For comparison, SAP's Cloud rev grew in CC by 13% / 13% / 17% / 20% in 4Q20-— 3Q21 while 3Q21 SAP Current Cloud backlog (contractually committed cloud rev expected to be recognised over the next 12 months) was up 22% y/y in CC to €8.2bn. 3Q22 non-GAAP EPS was $1.27 vs consensus at $0.92. Note that mark-to-market accounting of the company’s strategic investments benefited non-GAAP EPS by $0.28. CRM raised its FY22 guidance to $26.39-26.40bn (c.24% growth) from $26.2-26.3bn (c.23-24%% growth) vs cons at $26.34bn. The company also raised its non-GAAP op. margin / EPS to c.18.6% / $4.68-4.69, from c.18.5% / $4.36-4.38, vs cons at 18.6% / $4.42. For 4Q, CRM expects non-GAAP EPS of $0.72-0.73 on revs of $7.224-7.234bn, below cons at $0.82 / $7.238bn driven by a $0.49 earnings drag from integration efforts of recent acquisitions. The company also guided to 4Q current remaining performance obligations growth of 19% y/y, a marked slowdown from the 23% growth seen in 3Q.

LOGN SW,LOGN,Nov 12 2021 12:01PM,Logitech,Technology Hardware,Model update: lower valuation but higher costs ,"Despite solid FYQ2 results reporting last month, contrary to its peers, the stockderated in line with the (gaming) sector as most investors had expected a profit guidance raise from LOGN for FY 2022 given the strong positive seasonality of its business in H2. As LOGN had built significant inventory, the company had overcome component shortages better than peers. Nevertheless, LOGN has to swallow higher logistic costs etc., hitting profits in the current FY and explaining the gap from guidance of up to USD 850m non-GAAP operating profit vs investor expectations of some USD 900m+ going into results. e Therefore, we have updated our financial model to reflect additional supply chain costs in the current FY (ending in March 2022). This adjustment reduces our adj. EPS forecast for the current year by 8%. We leave our estimates unchanged for FY 2022/23, as shown in the table below. Our updated DCF model yields CHF 83 (down from CHF 98) on lower long-term growth assumptions and higher costs. e Valuation of the stock at 19x P/E 2023E looks very low for a Swiss company, and rising COVID infections in Europe could improve investor sentiment on WFH stocks such as LOGN. e@ However, demand risks remain very high going forward. As such, our research suggests that the growth in PC peripherals (44% of group sales) will not be sustained into CY 2022, making valuation less attractive once growth rates turn negative in a meaningful manner (we see sales shrinking by 7% Y/Y in FY22/23E). e Hold rating unchanged.

UHR SW,UHR,Nov 17 2021 02:04AM,Swatch Group,Consumer Goods,Model update: on track to meet FY21 consensus EBIT ,"What’s changed? Changes to our 2021-22E sales forecasts were immaterial, but wehave slightly lifted our FY21-22 EBIT forecasts by 1-3%, respectively, reflecting slightly higher margin assumptions (14.2% for 2H21 and 2022E). Thesis. We believe Swatch Group shares offer interesting margin recovery potential as sales make a gradual recovery towards 2019 levels due to a relatively lean operating cost base and its vertically integrated supply chain. The stock remains the cheapest in our luxury coverage at <11x 2022E EV/EBIT, with net cash and marketable securities of c.CHF2bn at the end of June (13% of its market cap), gold and diamonds worth CHF2.3bn at the end of last year (15% of its market cap) and hidden value from owned prime real estate in Zurich, Tokyo, Milan and Dusseldorf. ","Model assumptions. We forecast +13% sales growth at CER in 2H21 or -3% on a two- year stack basis (resulting in CHF7.26bn sales in FY21) and a 13.1% margin in FY21 (14.2% in 2H21), translating into CHF950m EBIT (in line with consensus). For FY22, we forecast CHF7.9bn sales and a 14.2% margin, with a bull case margin scenario of 15.0%. The positive margin development should be supported by lower personnel costs (relative to 2019 levels) and improving capacity utilisation at the Production unit (which turned profitable last June). Contrast with Richemont Specialist Watchmakers’ performance. Richemont reported a sequential two-year growth acceleration for Specialist Watchmakers (+13% in 2Q22 from +7% in 1Q22), flattered by a significant increase in their store network (from 739 internal stores and franchise stores at the end of September 2020 to 811 at the end of September 2021), with the bulk of these openings happening in China. This partially explains our lower two-year growth expectations for Swatch Group, which is likely to have been held back by its exposure to highly competitive lower price segments (c.20% of group sales). The only two brands that were already above 2019 levels in the first half of 2021 were Harry Winston and Blancpain, illustrating the stronger growth momentum of jewellery and higher-end watches. Unbalanced geo mix: high exposure to Mainland China, low exposure to US. The US has been the brightest spot for the luxury sector this year. Unfortunately, the US accounted for only 6% of Swatch Group sales last year (well below 22% of Richemont sales in 1H22). In contrast, Mainland China represented 38% of Swatch Group sales in CY20 (vs 28% of Richemont sales in FY21), hence Swatch has been even more exposed to COVID-related disruption in Q3. We believe Richemont has also benefited from its established presence on Tmall to better manage the inevitable offline/online swings due to COVID restrictions in China during the summer. Flagship brand Omega should have gained share in 2H21 supported by the release of the James Bond movie and the visibility around the Olympics, with Watches of Switzerland calling out Omega as one of its best performing brands in the US/UK on 09/11/21. Incidentally, we estimate Omega’s fair value alone close to CHF9bn (60% of Swatch Group's market cap) if we apply the estimated implied sales multiple recently paid by Partners Group for Breitling (CHF3bn value for a brand generating CHF700m annual revenues, on our estimates) to Omega’s estimated CHF2.1bn revenue base pre- pandemic, another illustration of Swatch Group’s undervaluation.

RR/ LN,RR/,Dec 10 2021 01:00AM,Rolls-Royce,Aerospace & Defence,Model Update Post Trading Update ,"We update our financial model for Rolls-Royce (rated Hold) following its TradingUpdate, and to reflect the pending disposals of ITP and others. We increase our FY-21 EPS estimate, and leave FY-22 EPS and our PT unchanged (implying a 5% TSR). We also include an ESG Assessment with this note. e We view the Trading Update as neutral overall: more rapid achievement of restructuring savings, a Q3-21 FCF inflow and improved FY-21 FCF outflow guidance (to ""A little bit better"" than £-1.7bn) were offset by installed engine sales and shop visits being at the lower end of guidance, Large Engine Flying Hours only creeping up to ~50% of the 2019 level, and flagging of supply-chain risks to Power Systems’ performance, particularly for FY-22. e@ We see the update as neutral to our thesis, that RR should have the potential, like other Civil Aero stocks, to be a revenue, margin and cashflow recovery story. The slow pace of long-haul traffic recovery continues to surprise negatively, hindered most recently by the spread of the omicron variant and consequently tighter travel restrictions, which, combined with other issues, including supply-chain challenges at Power Systems and an erratic track record, reduces confidence in the pacing of FCF recovery, in our view. e Given this, we have a clear preference for Airbus (€105.50, Buy), Safran (€105.96, Buy), or MTU Aero Engines (€171.30, Buy). We would become more positive on RR shares if there were to be a significant acceleration in the profile of FCF improvement, due to a faster recovery in wide-body Engine Flying Hours, or to deeper and sustainable cash cost cuts, or a more attractive entry point. e In 2021 YTD, RR shares are up 13%, vs +14% for the FTSE 100 index, and +6% for the Stoxx A&D index. RR trades around the middle of European A&D on P/E beyond FY-21, although in the lower-half of the sector on FCF Yield, which we see as justified by a very strong estimated EPS recovery CAGR of 57% (FY-21 to FY-24), benefiting from the base effect of a depressed FY-21 level. ","FY-21 EPS Estimate Increased Our “Underlying EPS” estimates are now 3.0p (2021E, up vs -5.0p previously) and 6.0p (2022E, unchanged vs 6.0p previously). A base effect greatly magnifies percentage changes. The FY-21 increase is due mainly to higher Civil Aerospace margins, partly offset by slightly lower Power Systems margins. These are in line with Visible Alpha consensus (on a last 90-day-basis) of 3.5p and 6.9p, respectively. Valuation Rolls-Royce shares trade at a 21x 2022 P/E, falling to 16x on our 2023E “Underlying EPS’ estimate (vs European Civil Aero. mean of 26x / 18x). FCF is a key focus at RR, and it trades at a 2023E FCF yield, on our new estimates, of 4.6%, which compares with the Euro. Civil Aero. mean of 4.7% and engine peer Safran on 4.7%. Price Target Unchanged Our PT is 130p (unchanged vs 130p previously). It is derived from a target 2023 FCF Yield of 4.4% (vs the current Euro. Civil Aero. mean of 4.7%) applied to our estimated FY-23 FCF (by our definition, which is consistent across the sector). This produces a price target of 130p, which implies that in one year's time, RR shares trade at 17x FY-23E EPS, which implies a Total Shareholder Return of 5% from current levels.

BA/ LN,BA/,Dec 23 2021 01:00AM,BAE Systems,Aerospace & Defence,Model Update ,"We update our financial model for BAE Systems (rated Hold) followingdiscussion with the Company. We trim our EPS estimates (to levels that are very slightly below consensus from FY-22 onwards), and leave our 500p PT unchanged (implying a -4% TSR). We also include an ESG Assessment with this note. e BAE is, to our eyes, generally executing well, with margins close to effective ceiling levels (given mix), a solid last-3-year book-to-bill of 1.13x, and a welcome resumption of the share buy-back. However, we see the dominant issues as being a backdrop of pressure on defence spending of its largest customers and an impasse on significant Saudi orders, coupled with upward pressure on tax rates. We expect these to lead to just a 3% EPS CAGR from FY-21 to FY-24. Given this, and our belief that multiple expansion may be limited both by uncertainty on the post-COVID profile of US and UK defence spending, and a long-term, secular shift to ESG investing, our rating remains a Hold. e We continue to believe that more Aerospace-biased names may perform better when coronavirus is perceived to recede again, and over the medium-term, reversal of fiscal expansion may pressure defence spending, so we maintain our Hold rating. Amongst defence-oriented stocks, we would prefer significant valuation anomalies and stock-specific stories, including Buy-rated Dassault Aviation (AM FP, €92.65) or Leonardo (LDO IM, €6.26). e In 2021 year-to-date, BAE shares are up 11%, vs +14% for the FTSE 100, and +8% for the European A&D Sector (as measured by the Stoxx A&D index). ","EPS Estimates Cut Our ""Underlying EPS"" estimates are now 47.5p (2021E, down 2% vs 48.5p previously) and 48.5p (2022E, down 8% vs 52.5p previously). The cuts are mainly due to slightly lower margin assumptions at Air and Maritime, and to a higher effective tax rate assumption for FY-22 (21% vs 18% previously), partly offset by a more favourable £/$ spot FX rate (we assume $1.33 vs $1.40 previously). These estimates are +2% above and -3% below current I/B/E/S median consensus of 46.5p and 49.7p, respectively. Price Target Unchanged Our PT is 500p (unchanged vs 500p previously). It is derived from our FY-23 EPS estimate of 50.5p (down 3% vs 52.0p previously), plus a FTSE 100 market multiple of 12x (down slightly vs 13x previously), plus a target P/E Relative of 83% (vs 76% previously), which is 0.4 standard deviations below its 10-year mean. Essentially, a slightly lower FY-23 EPS estimate and market multiple have been offset by slightly higher target P/ Relative. This produces a price target of 500p, which implies that in one year's time, BAE shares trade at 10x FY-23 EPS, which is slightly below their 10-year mean of 11x, and which implies a Total Shareholder Return of -3% from current levels (including a FY-21E dividend of 24.0p). Valuation and Next Event BAE shares trade at 11x 2022E EPS, similarly at 11x 2023E EPS (vs. Euro. Defence Primes' mean of 10x 2022E, falling to 9x 2023E). This compares to their 10-year mean of 11x Forecast Year 2 EPS. On EV/FCF, the shares trade similarly slightly expensively relative to peers, at 15x our 2022E FCF estimate, falling to 14x 2023E FCF (vs. peers on 15x 2022E, falling to 12x 2023E).

HEN3 GY,HEN3,Nov 09 2021 12:00AM,Henkel,Personal & Household Goods,Model update post 3Q21 result - in a pickle ,"What's changed? We reduce our FY21-22E EBIT forecasts for Henkel by -2% and -3%,respectively following the release of 3Q21 sales and a revised FY21 earnings guidance at the lower end of the previous guidance range (due to intensifying raw material and freight cost pressure on margins). We reduce our target price to €84. Hold. Thesis unchanged. Henkel shares look cheap, but we believe they still lack catalysts for re-rating. This is due to weakening volume momentum in mature markets (especially in North America) and Beauty Care, further US laundry market share erosion and intensifying margin pressure due to unprecedented raw material and freight cost inflation pressure that will likely persist in 2022, in our view. ","Henkel reported +3.5% organic growth in Q3, which represents respectable +7.5% growth versus 3Q19. Adhesives stood out again, with a balanced positive contribution from both volume and price to +7.0% organic growth in Q3. In contrast, Beauty (-3.0% organic decline) and Laundry & Home (+2% organic growth) saw increasing positive price momentum (especially for Laundry & Home) overshadowed by weakening volume trends, most notably for Beauty (-4.7%). Henkel left its FY21 sales guidance unchanged at 6-8% (consistent with consensus at +7%). Margin pressure. Henkel guided FY21 EBIT margin at the low-end of its previous margin guidance range (c.13.5% for the group, c.16.0% for Adhesives, c.9.5% for Beauty Care and c.14.0% for Laundry & Home) as raw material cost inflation pressure worsened to low to mid teen % increase (from low teen % increase previously). The time lag to mitigate such unprecedented cost inflation via pricing means margin pressure in 2H21 that will likely persist in 1H22. Visibility is limited by the historical difficulties in negotiating price hikes with Western European retailers or in strategic markets like North America, where recent volume weakness is a concern. What did we like in Henkel's Q3? Adhesives balanced growth driven by DD% growth for Metals, Electronics & Industrials and Packaging, with 30% of sales from e-commerce; e@ Positive pricing momentum, especially for Adhesives and Laundry. We understand this was driven by emerging markets and largely related to FX. e@ Market share gains in hair coloration/styling, toilet care and auto dishwashing. e@ Organic growth in emerging markets (+8.3%) and e-commerce (+20%). What did concern us today? Further market share losses in US laundry (no inflection point yet). e@ Double-digit % volume declines in Body Care in North America and Western Europe (lapping the soap consumption spike in 2020). e@ Sales decline in at-home hair coloration and hard surface cleaners with demand normalising after a spike in consumption in 2020. Overall growth stagnation in mature markets (-0.2% organic) and the magnitude of top line underperformance vs. peers in North America (-2.6% organic). Volume weakness in mature markets is a clear concern at times when Henkel needs to hike prices to offset escalating cost inflation.

BRBY LN,BRBY,Nov 11 2021 03:33PM,Burberry,Consumer Goods,Model update and call feedback post 1H22 results — check under the hood ,"Immaterial FY22-23E sales & EBIT forecast changes post 1H22 results today.Our FY22-23E sales assumptions are broadly unchanged as stronger than expected wholesale revenues offset slightly lower retail LFL assumptions. Our FY22-23E margin forecasts are also unchanged, underpinned by Burberry's focus on full-price sales and the complete exit of markdowns by the end of FY22. We trim our PT to 2300p. Sell-off looks overdone to us. Burberry's soft Q2 comp performance in Asia does not help our Buy case, but we think today's share price reaction (-5%) was too harsh given that consensus sales and margin are unlikely to move much. In addition, we heard three key messages today supporting a constructive view on the stock: (1) Continuity of current strategy with new CEO Jonathan Akeroyd, so no major strategic shifts are expected when he arrives in April (reducing fears of another earnings reset when he arrives); (2) China recovered in September after temporary weakness in August, with comparable growth above July and at similar levels to Q1; (3) High sales quality driven by full-price across all regions, with greater brand traction with younger consumers, higher AUR driven by an elevated product offer (especially in the strategic categories of outwear and leather goods), elevated store experience to recruit higher-spending customers (with the roll-out of 50 new concept stores this fiscal year), much lower levels of product going to outlets and no markdowns in mainline stores in the first half. The improved sales quality enhanced Burberry's financial performance in terms of gross margin expansion and free cash conversion in excess of 100%. Burberry remains one the very few undervalued stocks in our luxury coverage, in our view, trading at a much wider discount than usual to its luxury peers and the broader European market, which we deem excessive. ","Management is comfortable with current FY22 consensus (£469m adjusted operating profit) after stronger than 1H21 EBIT performance (£196m vs. £181m consensus) and taking on board the usual H2-weighted phasing of opex. Underlying margin improvement is even better than reported numbers given the FX headwinds that Burberry is facing this year (40m headwind at EBIT level in FY22). At the revenue level, wholesale strength is offsetting slowing retail comps in Asia due to COVID restrictions in Southeast Asia and Japan. China: solid performance in H1, except for the month of August. Q2 was affected by COVID restrictions in August, but sales recovered in September to similar levels seen in July and the Apr-Jun quarter. Mainland China sales were up 30% y-o-y (+40% full- price) led by outwear and leather goods in H1. October trading in China was in line with management expectations. Burberry re-calibrated its investments in communication in China (after being relatively quiet in 1Q22) and opened an important new flagship store in Plaza 66 this week. The main near-term risk that we see is the potential resurgence of COVID cases leading to new lockdowns in China as we get closer to the Beijing Winter Olympic Games in early 2022. Further progress on the strategic categories. Outwear saw improving momentum in Q2, with double-digit growth in full price driven by coats and jackets. Rainwear is also improved as Burberry is coming into its key selling period where sales tend to pick up. New leather bag families are attracting new and younger clients, with the top 5 female bags accounting for c.70% of total business, with all shapes contributing to growth and no consumer resistance to price increases implemented last May.

ALFRE FP,ALFRE,Nov 24 2021 02:12AM,freelance.com,Business Services,Model update following Q3 sales ,"We have slightly adjusted our model following the Q3 sales release. The groupreleased Q3 sales up +32% (+34% in France and +24% internationally) and raised its guidance. They now expect 2021 revenues to likely exceed their previous estimate of €620m-€640m. e After having updated our model, we now expect €639.4m pro forma revenues for 2021 and c.+15% CAGR (vs 13%) by 2025. e We see EBIT margins standing at 3%, with €19.3m for 2021E (vs €18.4m initially) and we still expect 5.5% EBIT margin to be reached by 2025, a level which we consider normative. e Our DCF-based valuation leads to a fair value of €9.87 per share and our peer group approach leads to €9.03. This results in a new price target of €9.45, providing +28% upside potential. ","Following the Q3 revenue release, we have adjusted our revenue growth and margin forecasts. We now expect revenues of €639.4m and €19.3m of EBIT for 2021. Furthermore, we expect the group to almost reach €1bn in sales as early as 2024 (with €982m), compared with the guidance targeting €1bn for 2025. This forecast excludes external growth; however, the company is expected to continue its build-up and may acquire a company as early as 2022, in our opinion. Regarding sales, we have taken into account a higher contribution from Helvetic Payroll (HP) in the pro forma revenue and a slightly higher organic growth dynamic by 2025 (around +15% CAGR vs +13% previously). We have fully integrated the €200m of revenue expected with HP in 2021, compared to an initial €160m contribution. In addition, this scope grew 30% per year over the past three years. If this momentum is maintained, our growth forecast may prove too conservative. We have also adjusted the organic growth in 2021 on the historical scope which includes Inop's; organic sales grew 15% in the first nine months of the year, with an acceleration to 32% in Q3. We therefore expect 17% organic growth for the year. Considering a growth rate of +30%/year on the HP perimeter, which represents about 30% of the activity, and 15-20% on the historical scope including Inop's (of which growth seems to be attributable more to the complementarity of the offers than to base effects) representing 70% of the activity, we think our initial growth scenario by 2025 of about +13%/year becomes too conservative. We now forecast around a +15% CAGR by 2025 instead. Regarding margins, we have raised our expected EBIT in 2021 to €19.3m, i.e. a 3.3% margin compared to €18.4m. Starting from €4.4m EBIT in H1, the historical Freelance.com perimeter could reach EBIT of €9m. Considering a minimum 5% EBIT margin on HP, which management says has an excellent profitability, the EBIT of this business could exceed €10m. Thus, we think the group should easily generate more than €19m EBIT. Our DCF-based valuation now leads to €9.87 per share, meaning an implicit EV/SALES 2022E of x0.82, and our peer group approach leads to €9.03, meaning x0.74 EV/SALES 2022E. Our price target increases to €9.45, providing +28% upside from current share price levels.

JST GY,JST,Nov 25 2021 01:00AM,JOST Werke AG,Automotive Supplier,Model update post 3Q21 results and CMD ,"JST hosted a CMD on November 23 and set reasonable and convincing financialtargets that back consensus expectations but will, in our view, not materially alter the expected earnings trajectory. e With margin targets and consensus expectations well aligned, we think truck cycle considerations remain the key factor for the share price at this stage. e We fine-tune our estimates post 3Q21 reporting and the CMD and derive a slightly lower price target of €52 (from €56) and reiterate Hold. ","CMD feedback - financial targets back consensus expectations but that's it JST hosted a virtual CMD on November 23, which we think backed current consensus expectations but is unlikely to materially alter the expected earnings trajectory. The firm is aiming for over-the-cycle revenue growth in the mid to high single-digit range, i.e. a c2-3pp outperformance vs. underlying truck/trailer/agri production on the back of regional expansion, market share gains, and upselling opportunities. JST also targets a mid- term over-the-cycle EBIT margin in the 10-11.5% corridor, which is where margins have already been between 2017-2019 (10.9%/10.7%/10.4%) and in 2014 (11.4%) before the acquisition of Mercedes-Benz Trailer Axle Systems. Overall, management set reasonable and convincing financial targets as well as a clear outline on how to achieve them. Yet, we think implications for consensus and the share price are limited at this stage. With Stifel (10.7%/10.9% for 2022/23E) and consensus (10.6%/10.7%) margin expectations already within the target range, we think volume and truck cycle expectations will be the dominant share price factor in the near-term. While underlying truck demand remains strong, we think component availability will continue to constrain production through 2022 before truck demand might eventually peak in Europe and North America around 2023. Model update post 3Q21 results and CMD Following 3Q21 reporting and the CMD, we fine-tune our estimates. Our revenue sequence rises by c2-3% for 2021-2023E as we reflect better volumes and pricing while our adj. EBIT sequence declines by c1-2% as we reflect input cost inflation.

NESN SW,NESN,Oct 21 2021 01:00AM,Nestle,Food & Beverage,Model update post another outstanding quarter ,"Nestlé posted another strong quarter of sales (6.5% OG) that beat expectationson the back of extended at-home consumption, reviving out-of-home consumption and e-commerce sales. e@ Though, this part of the at-home sales could reverse at some point, we consider the level to remain high for the time being and believe Nestlé has the right portfolio to deliver sustained high growth thereafter. e Our price target stays at CHF 130 and we continue to like the stock. ","Investment case update — another beat on OG in Q3. Nestle saw another exceptional high growth quarter (6.5% OG), driven by 4.4% RIG and 2.1% pricing. Pet food grew again strongly with 15.7% in the quarter, while coffee decreased to MSD growth in Q3. Water (+6%), Confectionery (+%) and Prepared Meals (+X%) all posted strong growth. Allin all, a longer than expected expansion of a high level of at-home-consumption has also prevailed in Q3-21 and supported Nestlé‘s strong sales performance. Recovering out-of-home channels and strong momentum in e-commerce (stands now for 14% of sales) have additionally supported NESN's performance. Though, the trend of more at-home consumption could reverse at some point, we consider it to continue for the time being and believe Nestlé has the right portfolio to deliver sustained high growth thereafter. Reflective of the rising input cost burden, pricing has increased sequentionally (1.2%/1.4%/2.1%/ in Q1/Q2/Q3-21) and we expect this trend to continue well into FY-22. Nestlé still expects roughly 4% COGS inflation for the full year, with a further effect expected in FY-22. Since May, the situation has worsened (logistics and labor costs in particular), but thanks to the higher than expected OG, NESN considers its UTOP margin target of ""around 17.5%"" still conservative. We would not rule out a positive surprise and have a margin of 17.6% in our estimates. Looking ahead into 2022, we stay convinced of NESN's growth momentum, which will likely be more dominated by price effects than RIG. In fact, we expect an OG of 4.7%, composed of 2.5% pricing and 2.2% RIG. As soon as pricing is fully aligned with cost inflation (which we expect for spring 2022), NESN should be able to expand its UTOP margin again. Hence, we expect pricing, operating leverage and absence of integration effect of the Bountiful brands (-10bps impact in FY-21) to result in an improved UTOP margin of 17.8% in FY-22E. Changes to our numbers. In the aftermath of the Q3 volume numbers, we adjust our growth estimates and expect newly an OG of 6.7% (vs. new company guidance of 6-7%) for FY-21E. We leave our UTOP margin assumption unchanged at 17.6% and see potential for a margin improvement of 20bps in FY-22E when pricing gains further traction. We downward adjust our EPS by -1.7%/-2.6%/-2.8% for FY-21-23E, reflecting lower assumptions on contributions from associates. Valuation and stock action. We value Nestle based on 50% DCF (1.0 beta, 6.4% WACC, 1.5% LTG) and 50% SOTP, which combined results in a price target of CHF 130 (vs. CHF 130 before). We acknowledge the risk of rising yields with a detrimental effect on the stock, which is seen as a bond substitute by some of the investors. However, Nestlé‘s today’s portfolio should enable the company to deliver sustained MSD OG, and therefore to clearly outperform its peers, many of which have seen a temporary pandemic related acceleration in sales.

RMS FP,RMS,Oct 25 2021 12:10PM,Hermes,Consumer Goods,Model update post 3Q21 - on its way to break the €9bn revenue mark ,"Virtually on par with Gucci. Even with an anticipated slowdown for Leather Goods in4Q21 (due to low level of stocks at the end of Q3), we expect Hermés to finish 2021 very close to the €9bn revenue mark, putting it virtually on par with Gucci and only behind LV and Chanel. The law of big numbers does not help luxury mega-brands given their structural need to balance growth and accessibility, but Hermés has a textbook product diversification strategy that has allowed it to reach a much wider consumer base without losing neither its iconic appeal nor the loyalty of its traditional Western local clientele. Own e-commerce is growing fast off a small base and is enabling Hermés to recruit many new customers to the brand. Why Hold? Expected deceleration for Leather Goods in Q4 (due to its supply-led business model) may cap sales upgrades. Accelerating opex inflation (step-up in hiring and communication costs in H2 as well as higher depreciation charges) may cap consensus margin upside. A rich starting valuation (e.g. 13.5x 2022E EV/sales vs. 6.5x past 27-year average) suggests moderating returns next year and greater upside elsewhere in our coverage. What's changed? Following better than expected 3Q21 sales performance, we lifted our FY21-22E sales forecasts for Hermés by 2% and our FY21-22E EBIT estimates by 1%. We lifted our PT accordingly to €1250 and retain our Hold rating. ","Sequential two-year stack acceleration across all divisions shows that Hermés brand desirability remains very high, with a sharper rebound in Europe being the main positive surprise in Q3. In addition to intact demand dynamics for leather goods, the broad-based sequential acceleration across all product divisions - especially for Ready-to-Wear & Accessories, Homeware, Jewellery and Silk & Textiles - suggests that brand desirability remains very high. From a regional perspective, the sharper sales rebound in Europe (especially in France) was the biggest positive surprise to us in Q3. As expected, Hermés also sustained dynamism in Asia, shrugging off COVID restrictions in the region. Recruiting new customers with e-commerce: Hermés continued to enjoy strong triple- digit growth from its own e-commerce, off a very low base. With 75% of the online growth coming from new customers, e-commerce has become a powerful tool for Hermés to recruit new customers. Leather Goods should decelerate in 4Q21. Strong demand levels, controlled supply and low stock levels at the end of Q3 (as the exceptional boost from the in-transit inventory excess at the end of 2020 played out in the first nine months of 2021) should translate into a flattish leather sales y-o-y in Q4. The company continues to plan its investments to support +7% volume growth for 2022 and beyond. Hermés recently opened its 19th leather workshop in Saint-Vincent-De-Paul (Gironde) and has three other new leather workshops in the pipeline, located in Louviers, Tournes and Riom, for which recruitment and training are ongoing. In the last decade, Hermés significantly expanded its leather capacity, with nine leather workshop openings in France since 2010. Valuation: Hermés trades at 56x 2022E P/E, above its past 27-year average of 32x. Hermés's 13.5x 2022E EV/sales valuation compares to a past 27-year average of 6.5x. Its current P/E premium to MSCI Europe at 280% compares to a past 10-year average of 130%. Hermés’ market cap exceeds Kering’s and Richemont’s combined. Any sector rookie knows that Hermés is a unique asset, but is it really worth more than Gucci, Cartier, YSL, Van Cleef, BV, Balenciaga plus all the other smaller houses in Kering’s and Richemont’s portfolio all together? With such a rich starting valuation, we expect future returns for Hermés to moderate, with greater upside elsewhere in our coverage.",Rogerio Fujimori,Rogerio Fujimori,1250,1200,Hold,,EUR,21.6,,24.2,,7.36,8.25,,,,,M,STIFEL_Model update_CoNote_Oct 25 2021 12-10PM.pdf,STIFEL_Model update_CoNote_Oct 25 2021 12-10PM,EARNINGS UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=17e64c08-5690-47a6-91df-e621597256fc&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

The 2021 clean EBIT guidance of EUR 7.5-8.0bn translates to EUR 1.0-1.5bn for Q4-21 (-10% to +35% y/y). We update our clean Q4 EBIT forecast to EUR 1.4bn (+26% y/y, consensus: EUR 1.3bn), i.e. EUR 7.9bn for FY-21. We reduced our estimates for Chemicals and Agro considerably, with only slight changes in the other segments. At upstream, the Chemicals margin might show a continuing normalization, but we expect Materials to defend high margins in Q4. 2022 earnings still expected to be strong and above mid-cycle. While we reduced our forecast for 2021, we reiterate our view of strong earnings in 2022. We even increased our assumptions for the Materials segment on the back of ongoing high margins at PUR and an expected rebound in global car production. While we still expect Agro to show a meaningful earnings rebound, the extent might be less than assumed so far, as the headwind from logistics and raw material costs should only gradually fade. Surface Technology should benefit from higher car production, but the lack of the one- time benefits from escalated precious metal prices is probably the dominating impact. On the back of these assumptions, clean EBIT should be around EUR 7bn. While our EBIT forecast is close to consensus, our EPS estimates are higher. The deviation is mainly explained by the financial income. Here, our forecast is higher due to our assumed strong contribution from Wintershall DEA (at equity consolidation). Reversal of downward share price trend expected for 2022: The share price ignored the earnings uplift in 2021, as we believe it was not seen as sustainable and potentially only a one-year event. The normalization of margins is under way in Chemicals and Surface Technology, but Materials margin should continue to stay high in 2022, in our view. Even after the normalization, the margin should be favorable. The CEO highlighted that demand is strong in Q4 and also going into 2022. The recovery of the automotive industry in the course of 2022 and the switch to EVs should support the demand throughout the year. The global chemical capacity utilization is at >90%, according to the ACC. Capacity additions will probably be limited over the coming years due to cuts in capex budgets during the pandemic, constraints in sourcing and labor, as well as rising hurdles to receive permits in China. We therefore see multiple reasons for the favorable supply demand situation to continue over the coming years. On this backdrop, we contend confidence in BASF's earnings trend should increase, which should be finally reflected in a better share price performance in 2022.",Andreas Heine,Andreas Heine;Isha Sharma,81,,Buy,,EUR,7.07,,6.6,,3.4,3.5,,,,,M,STIFEL_Model update_CoNote_Oct 28 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Model update_CoNote_Oct 28 2021 01-00AM,EARNINGS UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=7a17aa70-ccab-4d42-b031-db08701f7e42&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

VBK GY,VBK,Nov 15 2021 01:00AM,VERBIO,Oil & Gas,"Money, Money, Money: All set for a record Q2 "," VERBIO is set to deliver a record quarter in Q2 this fiscal year backed by very highspreads in biodiesel and bioethanol e@ We hosted two roadshows in Europe and the US as well as a fireside chat with CEO Claus Sauter that supported our bullish view on the name e Based on the high spreads in Q2, we increase our EBITDA estimate for the running fiscal year by 13% and reiterate our Buy rating and €87 price target ","Hedging weighed on earnings in Q1, but Q2 more than compensates VERBIO's results with €40m EBITDA in Q1 was below and market expectations, however we are neither concerned about H1, FY21/22E or the story in general. VERBIO hedged parts of its Biodiesel position in Q1 in order to secure margin on the back of high rapeseed oil prices. As the price hike in biodiesel wasn't expected by the company, the risk management measure backfired. While this is undoubtedly unfortunate, we deem it as a reasonable action, given the limited availability of rapeseed oil VERBIO has secured for its future operations. The management is convinced that Q2 will be a stellar quarter backed by high spreads in both biodiesel and bioethanol. In addition, VERBIO has reduced its hedging exposure in biodiesel significantly, roughly one third of the Q1 position, and for that should gain from the current biofuels price hike. We reflect that development and increase our Q2 estimates significantly. Backed by high spreads in biodiesel and more so bioethanol, we increase our EBITDA estimate for Q2 by roughly €30m to roughly €70m, which brings our H1 estimate from €87m to €110m and overall FY21/22E to €185m, 23% above company guidance, which should be raised with H1 reporting at the latest, in our view. We like to state that we wouldn't be surprised if Q2 EBITDA alone would reach €100m, however stay conservative with our €70m due to commodity and trading uncertainties. We don't change our assumptions for the following years, hence keep our Buy recommendation and €87 price target. Roadshow focused on investment plan strenghtens optimism We hosted VERBIO's CEO Claus Sauter at a European and a US roadshow as well as fireside chat with meetings in very high demand. Our key takeaways from the roadshow and fireside chat are: VERBIO has lowered the biodiesel hedging exposure materially in Q2 in order to participate in the steep increase in biofuel prices. Position went down from around 50% in Q1 to about 15% in Q2. The supplying of raw materials to the chemicals industry should start gaining material momentum towards the second half of the decade. However, the move also depends on further (political) obligations for the chemicals industry. Similarly, shipping can be a huge upside potential going forward, but would also depend on a more tight regulatory environment for the maritime sector. Visibility will be increased by making Biomethane an own segment potentially in the next fiscal year. Buy rating and €87 price target confirmed We think our investment case is fully intact, reiterate our Buy rating and €87 price target. We derive our price target from a DCF and peer group analysis. We apply a 75% weighting to our DCF model to account for the strong mid-term growth and high expansion capex, and 25% to our peer-group analysis. Our peer group analysis-based FY22/23E EV/EBIT target multiple increases to 27.2x, which yields an implied equity value of €77.00 per share. Our DCF model yields €90.00 per share. The main risks to our investment case are failure of the global expansion, and fewer regulatory tailwinds in the biomethane business and regarding greenhouse gas (GHG) quotas.",Florian Pfeilschifter,Florian Pfeilschifter,87,,Buy,,EUR,1.58,,1.96,,0.2,0.2,,,,,M,"STIFEL_Money, Money,_CoNote_Nov 15 2021 01-00AM.pdf","STIFEL_Money, Money,_CoNote_Nov 15 2021 01-00AM",EARNINGS UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=75e3c4a9-9813-48e2-94f6-8ec6c621b3b7&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
BARN SW,BARN,Nov 22 2021 03:24AM,Barry Callebaut,Food & Beverage,More growth to come - G&S with more upside ," We expect an exceptional growth year on the basis of solidly growing chocolate markets,additional outsourcing contracts and rapid growth in G&S. e G&S growth could even surprise positively. See our scenario analysis within. e Our ESG analysis yields positive results and should help to alleviate some shareholder concerns. @ We keep our Buy rating and lift our price target from CHF 2,425 to CHF 2550. ","Case update. The full-year results show that FM and G&S returned to FY-19/20 levels and are set for further growth from there. Cocoa Products, on the other hand, remained below FY-19/20 levels, as BARN focused on higher margin volume. From a geographical perspective, Asia led the growth at (+8.7% y/y), despite local lockdowns. The Americas grew strongly (+7.9% volume), benefiting from large growth in FM and recovering G&S volumes. Europe posted sound growth as well (+5.5%) as a result of growth in FM and increasing mobility, which increased G&S volumes. As is usual for BARN, the company did not provide quantitative guidance for the new year but only confirmed the midterm targets. Nonetheless, this, combined with the positive business comments made by management, implies an exceptional growth year ahead, in our view (Stifel: 6.7%). Our optimism is based on: (1) solidly growing chocolate markets (Nielsen data showed 1.8% growth for the past year), (2) a strong pipeline for new outsourcing contracts, which got delayed during the pandemic, and (3) strong growth in Gourmet & Specialties (+36% in Q4-20/21). The latter is underpinned by BARN having reached the FY-19/20 level, despite the fact that BARN's clients are still operating below their capacities. Hence, newly won business during the pandemic along with recovering old customer business should have a very positive effect on volumes and overall profitability. We have a scenario analysis on G&S business recovery in the note. Changes to our numbers. We include the FY-20/21 results and adjust our EPS (adj.) estimates by -7.0%/-10.1% for the next two years, mainly based on a delay in the return to pre-crisis profitability and adjusted assumptions on interest costs in our model. We continue to believe BARN will focus on 'smart' (sustainable, high quality growth concentrated on emerging markets and G&S) growth and try to increase EBIT per tonne through better mix. After higher freight and packaging costs slightly affected the bottom line last year, we are confident that renegotiated contracts under the cost-plus model will have compensated for these effects with a positive impact on profitability. With anticipated strong growth in FM and G&S, the EBIT per tonne key metric should improve again in FY-21/22E on a group level (we model CHF 272 for FY-21/22 vs CHF 259 in FY-20/21). ESG. We assessed BARN along the three ESG parameters and found solid results in all three key areas. We would highlight the company's ambitious target to become carbon-neutral by 2025 (which is far earlier than most other peers) and the ambition to eliminate child labour from the value chain by 2025. Though not the primary driver in our case, we consider BARN's ESG strategy and progress to be credible, which should help to ease some doubts that investors may have. Valuation and stock action. We value the stock using DCF (50%) (new 1.0 beta vs. 1.1 before, 6.6% WACC vs 7.3% previously and unchanged 3.0% LTG) and an EV/EBIT 2022E multiple (50%), which combined provides us with a PT of CHF 2550. Major trigger points could include an announcement of a new, larger outsourcing contract or strong growth in G&S in H1-21/22.

TNXT IM,TNXT,Oct 27 2021 06:38AM,Tinexta,Business Services,More M&A in sight? ,"€100m investment by Bregal Milestone for a 16% stake in InfoCert. Today, Tinextaannounced the signing of a binding agreement with Bregal Milestone (a European technology growth capital firm, part of Bregal Investments, with >€12bn of AuM), according to which Bregal Milestone will invest €100m (€70m at closing and €30m within the following 12 months) for the subscription of a dedicated capital increase up to a total share of 16.09% of InfoCert's share capital. The agreements also foresee the possibility for Bregal Milestone to further increase its participation (within the following 12 months from the closing) up to a maximum of 19.95% of InfoCert's capital, with a total investment of €130m. ","Nice deal, fair valuation ... We would consider the move positively for the following main reasons: (1) Bregal Milestone is a PE fund with specific knowhow in the technology sector (and an extensive network of companies in Europe) and, as a partner and shareholder of InfoCert, would be able to support the company in its internationalisation process (particularly in scouting new opportunities abroad); (2) the group will obtain new resources for the implementation of its strategic plan, in a particularly favourable business environment (in view of the digital transformation trends currently in place in several European markets and the potential significant impact of the Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan — and similar investment plans abroad); (3) from a valuation standpoint, the transaction implies an EV/EBITDA multiple of around 20x (based on the adjusted LTM EBITDA of InfoCert and its subsidiaries, as recorded in June 2021), which seems good for the acquisition of a minority stake (with a three-year lockup) and compares with our SoP multiple of c.23x for the Digital Trust segment. ... likely fuelling more M&A over the next months. Despite having been very active in M&A this year (total investment of >€180m including put/call options), we believe that, following this transaction, the company may be pursuing more M&A deals in the coming months, likely involving the Digital Trust and the Innovation & Marketing Services sectors (with potential bolt-on acquisitions for the Cyber Security division) while, geographically, Spain, France and Germany could be the top priorities. Assuming a net debt/EBITDA ratio of up to 2.5x, we estimate that the company may have additional M&A firepower of >€400m over the next three years (FY22-24). Buy rating reiterated, price target still €49.50 (c.15% potential upside). We reiterate our positive stance on the stock, with a €49.50 price target, implying potential upside of c.15% vs. current market valuation. At our target, the shares would trade at FY22 adj.

The second c.$580m Commonwealth Wind cabling project will connect the Commonwealth Wind to the electricity grid in Massachusetts: Prysmian will design, supply, install, and commission HVAC 275 kV three-core cables with XLPE insulation and single-wire armouring, with delivery and commissioning for FY27. ...greenlighting local capacity expansion. As part of the Commonwealth Wind project agreement (and subject to several customary conditions precedent, such as obtaining permits to build the facilities and closing the contractual arrangements with the property owner), Prysmian also announced that it intends to build a manufacturing facility for submarine transmission cables at Brayton Point, in Somerset. Both cable supply awards are subject to the finalization of the Group’s plans to localize its footprint. According to the Company’s press release, the submarine cables for the Commonwealth Wind project are thus planned to be produced also in the new plant in Massachusetts (USA), as well as in Arco Felice (Italy) and Pikkala (Finland). A further proof that the US market for offshore wind farm projects is finally accelerating... We expect these awards to further raise visibility on the mid-term prospects of the Group’s Projects division (already sitting on a record €4.0bn order backlog as at the end of September), with a healthy associated profitability (we would assume an EBITDA margin of around 20%). Following the recent US awards of the biggest single HV project ($900m SOO Green HVDC Underground Link) and the largest ever submarine project (€630m Dominion Energy Group offshore wind) for the Company (we also remind that the Group received this year, after many delays in the past, the notice to proceed to start executing the Vineyard offshore wind farm), we believe that these new projects represent a further proof that the US market (both for interconnections and offshore wind farms) is finally accelerating. We reiterate our positive stance on the stock, with a €38.50 price target, providing 22% upside potential. The Group, in our view, is strongly positioned to benefit from Energy Transition, with a projected acceleration in investments both for interconnectors and offshore wind projects (driven by Europe). The US infrastructure plan should give further boost to end-demand, as most of the Company’s businesses, in our view, are directly or indirectly correlated to the planned step-up in investments. At our target, the stock would be trading at FY22 adj. EV/EBITDA and EV/EBIT multiples of 11.6x and 17.0x respectively, with a FCF yield of 4%.",Renato Gargiulo,Renato Gargiulo,38.5,,Buy,,EUR,1.34,,1.66,,0.5,0.5,,,,,M,STIFEL_New $900m_FlashCoNote_Dec 20 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_New $900m_FlashCoNote_Dec 20 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=568a6453-21f9-4996-a34e-1add4d91419b&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
SUN SW,SUN,Dec 06 2021 02:25AM,Sulzer,Capital Goods,New Chairman and CEO (and other leadership team changes) ,"Sulzer has announced various changes to its Board of Directors and ExecutiveBoard, some already discussed in the press, some more surprising. ","With Chairman Suzanne Thoma and CEO Frédéric Lalanne, Sulzer presents new faces to the financial community. new head of the Service division has also been appointed so we're seeing lot of changes in the leadership team all at once. However, we think this compliments Sulzer's succession planning in terms of identifying and presenting internal solutions for (almost) all the changes. Suzanne Thoma to succeed Chairman Peter Loscher: Following Peter Loéscher’s recently announced decision not to stand for re-election, Sulzer's BoD has unanimously voted to propose Suzanne Thoma as Chairperson at a shareholder vote at the April 2022 AGM. Dr Thoma is currently Vice-Chairperson and was elected in 2021. She is CEO of the energy and infrastructure group BKW AG and a member of OC Oerlikon's BoD (but announced she will not stand for re-election). Frédéric Lalanne to succeed CEO Gregoire Poux-Guillaume: CEO of Sulzer since December 2015, Mr Poux-Guillaume informed Sulzer's BoD of his desire to hand over his responsibilities to his successor in early 2022, after six years at the helm. Under his leadership, Sulzer was transformed through a combination of strategic repositioning, operational improvement and acquisitions. He led the development and listing of medmix AG, where he will remain Chairman. Sulzer's BoD has appointed Frédéric Lalanne, currently President of Sulzer’s Flow Equipment division, as CEO. Mr Lalannewill take over after the FY-21 results presentation on 18 February 2022. He led the turnaround in the loss-making Flow Equipment division to operational profitability which should approach 6% in 2021. He initially joined Sulzer in 2016 as Group Chief Commercial and Marketing Officer, wnen he modernised and energised Sulzer’s commercial approach and processes across all its businesses. Additional changes to Sulzer leadership team: Tim Schulten (Group Head of Strategy) will succeed Daniel Bischofberger as new leader in the Services division. In addition, BoD member, Gerhard Roiss, will not stand for re-election at the 2022 AGM.

JUN3 GY,3-Jun,Oct 25 2021 12:23PM,Jungheinrich,Industrials,"New guidance above, Q3 strong as expected ","Jungheinrich reported Q3 prelims: initial reaction positive. New 2021 EBITguidance is c.5% above Bloomberg consensus (new mid-point EUR 355m, consensus EUR 337m, Stifel EUR 365m). This said, consensus has barely changed since Q2 results (consensus then EUR 336m) that saw a significant EBIT beat (>10%). We therefore consider the reaction overdone. KION (Buy, €87.92) is part of our three top picks for 2021, preferred over Jungheinrich: we expect both KION’s higher share in IC-trucks and the nature of the exposure within warehouse automation (natural partner for larger e-commerce customers, regional focus US) to be more beneficial in 2021. We therefore consider both its relative valuation and ","absolute discount unjustified and unsustainable (KION trades on ac.25% discount on FY-23 EV/EBIT versus its five-year trailing average). Key points: #1 FY-21 guidance raise on orders and EBIT: Jungheinrich now guide an FY-21 order range of EUR 4.6-4.8bn (was 4.2-4.5bn, new mid-point EUR 4.7bn from EUR 4.35bn), sales range EUR 4.0-4.2bn (unchanged, mid-point EUR 4.1bn), EBIT reported EUR 340-370m (from EUR 300-350m, new mid-point EUR 355m from EUR 325m). Jungheinrich comment “production shutdowns have been avoided until now, material price increases were more than offset by price adjustments and efficiency measures”. #22021 consensus to see c.5% upside pressure: Consensus assumes group sales of EUR 4.2bn and EBIT of EUR 337m (i.e. below guidance lower-end, but barely changed since Q2 results). #3 Q3 prelims strong, as expected: Orders up 26% y/y (no consensus, 6% above Stifel) likely best explained by strong demand also in warehouse automation.

EO FP,EO,Nov 30 2021 01:00AM,Faurecia,Automotive Supplier,"New Guide is ""as conservative as possible"" ","In the wake of this second guidance reset, we have trimmed our 21-23E EPS sequenceby an average 12% and lowered our target to €51.50. e@ We estimate that this reset is roughly two-thirds company specific, underpinned by (a) ramp-up slippage at two particular sites (US), and (b) group's indexation to Europe (45% of 1H21 sales) and to Volkswagen/Stellantis geographic (41% of sales) e@ We would assume that 2021 earnings are de-risked and that the narrative should gradually shift to Hella's integration (closing late January/early February) and restocking prospects (cyclical recovery) as the availability of semiconductors improves. e Equally importantly, we believe that management's reputation is not in question at this stage, even if this second warning has - temporarily, we think - scratched it. We reiterate our Buy rating. ","Second earnings reset in two months Faurecia has rebooted FY21 guidance once again, looking for €15-15.5bn vs €15.5bn), with a margin of 5.5% (vs 6.0-6.2% previously) and FCF of €0.3bn+ (vs at least €0.5bn) on the back of four points: 1/ lower production assumption (-1m units in Europe in 2H21) combined to unabated stop-and-go related costs; 2/ unfavourable mix (Europe is 45% of Faurecia's revenues; STLA/VOW, which have cut expectations most lately, account for 41%), and 3/ specific cost overruns in two Michigan factories (supplying Jeep Wagoneer). Implied -€100/110m EBIT FY21 adjustment is two-thirds Faurecia-specifc The reduced revenues and margin assumptions imply a -€100-110m reduction in adjusted EBIT to €839m (mid range). Group has identified the following drivers : -€20m attributable to stop-and-go, -€30m of additional start-up costs at two Michigan factories and the remainder; -€55/-60m being mostly lost contribution (Europe/Volkswagen/Stellantis). No guidance at this stage for 2022 but interesting snippets from CFO's call Faurecia broadly assumes a flat LVP over the first half (no quarterly split) before a double-digit acceleration into 2H22 and, we understand, FY23. The lack of qualified workers/managers in Highland Park (two factories dedicated to Jeep Grand Wagoneer) are currently being solved, which should be a 70bps swing factor between both semesters. Overall drop through for 2022 is seen at 15% including raw material headwinds (a 50bps hurdle for 2022). FY21 earnings de-risked, management credibility not at stake During the call, the CFO was humble, in our view, in highlighting a ""completely unusual situation"" (two warnings in two months) in Faurecia's recent history. We would agree and assume that management credibility is not at stake at this stage. Moreover, we think the narrative should gradually shift from ""supply-chain / cost-inflation"" challenges to restocking, cyclical recovery, and Hella's integration (closing late January/early February). We have adjusted our 2021/2023EPS sequence by an average 12% on lower volumes and additional costs for FY21 (aligned with group guidance). For FY22, we have used the 15% operating leverage (including a 50bps cost headwind) provided by the CFO during call, albeit on lower revenue growth (we cautiously baked in a mid single-digit LVP growth next year, significantly below IHS now standing at +10.5%). Buy reiterated, see EPS almost tripling through 2023, 30%+ upside from here Using our usual three-way valuation (past multiples/peers multiple/DCF equally weighted) we derive price target of €51.5 (down from €54).

DOKA SW,DOKA,Nov 15 2021 02:07AM,dormakaba,Capital Goods,New mid-term targets finally out ,"Ahead of today's CMD, dormakababa's new management team finally presentedthe first details on its new strategy / mid-term targets, which should be taken as neutral to slightly positive by the market. Especially its pre-tax ROCE target >30% as of 2023/2024 should be liked, in our view (SFe 25-29%, depending on different goodwill considerations). Apart from a management reshuffling, dormakaba also adjusted its regional reporting structure, announced further ERP investments and provided an in-line business update. Excluding some likely additional one- offs (e.g. Mesker impairment in view of an expected divestment plan), we would currently not expect to see major underlying consensus estimate changes for the years to come. ","New mid-term targets finally out: The annual organic sales growth is now seen at 3-5% (vs. 0.5% in the last five years) and the adjusted EBITDA margin at 16-18% from 2023/2024 onwards (former EBITDA margin target of 18%, lower end broadly in line with current 2023/24 expectations, its key peer is even looking for a 16-17% EBIT margin). Furthermore, its pre-tax ROCE is expected to surpass 30% (slightly higher than anticipated while dorma's goodwill looks deducted in the calculation). On ESG, carbon-neutrality is expected by 2030, which we would only see linked to its own operations. In order to achieve these levels the company also had to announce further investment needs: 1) CHF 25m headcount reduction costs in FY'21/22, 2) additional CHF 35m IT investments p.a. during the upcoming five years. Solid trading update: Fully in line with the competition, the company reached a 7% organic growth in the first quarter of FY'21/22. Higher raw material prices could still be compensated by price increases, while the shortage of electronic components remains an area of concern, as recently also indicated from its US competition. Overall, organic growth is now seen up 3-5% (former consensus around 4.6% yoy) while the adjusted EBITDA margin is still seen slightly higher than 14.2% (consensus estimate around 14.9% looks slightly too high). Management reshuffling: CFO Bernd Brinker will step down as of April next year. While the company has not yet announced a successor, it appointed two further Executive Committee members with Mathias Mortl (COO) and Frederick Jeske- Schdénhoven (Chief Strategy & Marketing Officer).

RNO FP,RNO,Nov 10 2021 01:00AM,Renault SA,Automotive,"Nissan 2Q21 earnings: beat, raise and dividend payment (almost) in sight ","Nissan (NC, 43.4% held by Renault) beat consensus expectations, printing a positiveoperating profit in 2Q21 (vs slight losses of -JPY4.4bn expected by consensus). For FY21 (ending March 22), Nissan has raised consolidated operating profit expectations to JPY180bn (+13% above pre-event consensus) on better ""sales quality"", including a higher tailwind from the FinCo. On a more important note for Renault, Nissan now ticks almost all the boxes to resume distribution of dividends. No time-line has been set, but we would assume that first dividend could be received within the next 18 months (possibly 12 months). Overall, Nissan's 2Q21 earnings were good but not great, but good is enough for now. ","Please find below the key takeaways from the earnings call. Break-even standing below one million units per quarter? Nissan's break-even point has been further lowered to 3.7m/annum (vs 4.4m end of last FY) but incremental ""cost"" impact looks rather subdued in the quarterly operating bridge, contributing to a minimal +JPY2.3bn out of c.tJPY68bn earnings improvement 2Q vs 2Q. helping hand from the FinCo! COO, Gupta highlighted that the quality of sales has been the key driver in 2Q, but details are less exciting as, according to CFO Ma, we understand that c. +JPY35bn has been a non-repeat tailwind from FinCo (lower credit losses/better re- marketing of off-lease vehicles in a context of broad-based product scarcity for the entire industry). This tailwind is more than +50% of the operating profit improvement in 2Q. Many moving parts to the new guidance. The new JPY180bn operating profit guidance for FY21 factors in many moving parts, and sometimes these moving parts are conflicting: retail sales forecast are cut 600k, implying a 555k unit slump in 2H21-22 (vs +300k vehicles in 1H21) which is hard to reconcile with other comments from the COO/CFO highlighting that the situation is normalising on the semiconductor front (which would imply greater product availability in the second half). Also, the group sees no additional burden from raw materials (vs the July update), a slightly lower FX headwind, and ongoing focus on ""quality of sales"" which should help drive FY21 operating margins ""possibly"" north of the 2% mark. Resuming the dividend now hinges on positive FCF. As the other three levers have been met, positive free cash flow would need to be achieved at least for an unspecified number of quarters (it was still negative in 2Q21 0n WCR absorption) prior to the dividend being resumed. This is consistent with our thinking that the topic, which is key for RNO, is probably 12 to 18 months away. Conclusion: Nissan's 2Q21 earnings are probably of lower quality than at first glance (like we feared) as the CarCo is still losing money (c.-JPY62bn in the quarter) and has been in red territory since 4Q18/19. However, despite there being no major positive surprise, it was directionally good print as Nissan (and Renault) are restructuring/re-stocking stories into 2022, and not (yet) quality/electrification plays.

EDEN FP,EDEN,Nov 15 2021 01:00AM,Edenred,Business Services,No rationale for the underperformance - Reiterating Buy rating ,"We look in this note to the different factors that could have explained the recent stockunderperformance (c.-12% last two weeks), and we see no fundamental rationale behind it given; 1) the positive Q3 performance, bringing earnings upgrades; 2) the absence of read- across from the recent payment sector weakness; 3) the improving Latam outlook, 4) any potential fears around tougher competition would be overdone. We see the key pillars of our thesis still fully valid (sustainable earnings growth driven by the transformation strategy, strengthening of the operating profile, M&A upside). The stock performance has been decorrelated from the recent positive earnings momentum, with valuation multiples now below pre-pandemic levels. We thus confirm our Buy rating and would take advantage of current levels with both near- and mid-term upside. €58 PT unchanged (estimates broadly unchanged). ","Solid Q3 building up confidence on double-digit earnings growth path. Q3 showed an impressive performance in our view through sequential top-line growth acceleration (+13% 2- stack vs. +10.5% H1, figure 1), driven by the core business lines (figure 2). The company raised its FY21 EBITDA guidance to the upper-half of the initial €620-670m range, though still implying a conservative scenario in our view (+8% LFL y/y EBITDA growth in H2 the low- end vs. double-digit top-line growth). This release further underpinned our confidence on the outlook thanks to; 1) the acceleration of the markets penetration through digitization; 2) market share gain opportunities from the ‘virtual canteens’; 3) the diversification strategy through the deployment of adjacent services. Payment sector weakness: no read-across to Edenred. The payment sector has been week over the last two weeks, both in the US and Europe (figure 3). We see no read-across for Edenred's business model or the structual trends across its specific markets. We would also highlight the stock entails a reopening component and is a net beneficiary of inflation / rates increase. Latin America, improving outlook. Edenred has achieved a strong performance in the region in the context of the macro and sanitary backdrop with trends even accelerating during Q3 (c.+9% 2-y stack vs. c.+6%% H1) helped by an improvement in Brazil. Vaccination rates across the two largest countries, Brazil and Mexico, are improving (c.60% and c.50%, respectively), mobility data are solid (motorways traffic above 2019), fuel prices remain a tailwind and FX pressure is easing (figures 4-7). We believe the through has been reached and the region could provide some upside into next year. Any potential fears around tougher competitive environment are overdone in our view. Although Swile has been able to take a spot in the French market, its share its still low (< 10% SFe) and the company raised a significant amount over the last three years (c. €300m), confirming the high barriers to entry. We would also point to the positive market share momentum for Edenred in the country (+1pp/year over last 4-y), notably driven by its leading innovation strategy. Lastly, we think it would be too simplistic to view Edenred today as a meal voucher operator given the transformation of the business model into an intermediation platform with a global network and diversified set of solutions, ultimately providing competitive advantages. Valuation decorrelated from earnings momentum, with the stock now trading on 28x/24x FY22/FY23 P/E vs. pre-pandemic level of > 30x and recent peak closer to 40x. The stock benefited from mid-single digit earnings upgrades over the last quarter while the stock dropped by c.15% over the period (figures 8-9).

ALFRE FP,ALFRE,Dec 08 2021 01:00AM,freelance.com,Business Services,Non-deal roadshow feedback ,Summary of discussed points,"Freelancing is supported by the evolution of the work culture with an increasing search for autonomy on the talent side. It is also supported on the client side by the double need for cutting-edge experts and flexibility. In our opinion, freelance.com is very well positioned to capture growth thanks to its assets; its domain name is probably the most important one. The company has room to pursue its build-up strategy in a very fragmented market (leading to room for consolidation). They still target more than €640m in proforma sales for 2021 with €20-25m in EBIT and expect to generate €1bn in sales by 2025 excluding external growth for a normative EBIT margin of 5%. We believe management is very confident, and come away from this NDR with confidence in our forecasts which are perhaps still a little too conservative, in our ee view. Today, nearly 10% of the French working population are freelancers. French HR departments can no longer ignore this population when building their teams and are therefore launching more and more calls for tender. The regulatory framework tends to evolve in a positive direction to accompany this move. Freelancers choose this way of working in order to be able to choose more freely the projects in which they get involved and to gain flexibility in managing their own schedule. Thus, we contend companies need to have better cost control, increased flexibility, and cutting-edge experts on their teams. Management discussed the fact that temporary employment agencies are facing obstacles if they want to develop freelancing offers as: (1) legislation is not the same; (2) populations are not the same; and (3) the needs of the clients are not the same. Thus, the freelancing market is specific enough to require its own know-how, which creates barriers to entry. It was clarified following questions from investors that the group addresses freelancers on intellectual services only (they do not plan to address the driver and delivery platforms because the remuneration levels do not allow it). Freelance.com's domain name is a strong asset that enables the group to attract natural leads for free, which we find is a very important competitive advantage. Its legal and IT back office departments that reassure key accounts and talent are also important assets to ensure continued growth. We believe Freelance.com has a solid position with a 370k-expert base that represents a significant source of job leads, and thus potential revenue growth. Integration of Inop's, which had a very few customers in common with freelance.com and a very complementary offering, is now successfully completed. Laurent Levy have left the group as initially planned. The deal with Helvetic Payroll (HP) should be highly synergistic as HP generates €200m in revenue with only 18 employees (all in Switzerland). HP has been able to develop automated tools and processes in a complex and fragmented environment (they had to adapt to the different regulations of the Swiss cantons). e@ We expect they will continue their external growth strategy with an enhanced deal flow now that they have done two deals that have given them some visibility among market players.",Valentin-Paul Jahan,"Valentin-Paul Jahan, CFA",9.45,,Buy,,EUR,0.27,,0.35,,0,0,,,,,M,STIFEL_Non-deal roadshow_FlashCoNote_Dec 08 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Non-deal roadshow_FlashCoNote_Dec 08 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=c4186c67-2153-4df0-820f-b24fc87d4a6a&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
IG IM,IG,Oct 25 2021 01:00AM,Italgas,Utilities,Non-regulated revenues would drive double-digit EPS growth in Q3-21 ,"Italgas is publishing Q3/9M-21 results on 27 October. We expect that the companywould continue the positive trend reported in the previous quarters, consistent with RAB growth. We estimate that EBITDA and net profit would increase on adjusted basis by 7% and 11% respectively. Capex would continue to accelerate. The 6% increase in net debt versus end 2020 would be mainly determined by acceleration in investments, dividend payments in the period and the seasonal increase in working capital in Q3. ","We have a Hold rating on the stock. Our PT offers limited upside versus the current share price. We think that the current share price fairly reflects the difficult progress of the tenders for the renewal of Italian gas distribution concessions, which prevents unlocking the value creation opportunities that would arise for Italgas. We do not expect a penalizing outcome from the ongoing regulatory review for WACC in electricity and gas regulated businesses in Italy. Our detailed estimates for Q3-21 are the following: Revenues would grow by 2% y/y to €339m. We estimate that revenues would benefit from higher contribution from non-regulated businesses than in Q3-20, which would more than offset the €12m one-off recovery of regulated tariffs accounted last year Operating costs in line with the same period of 2020 would result in 2% improvement in EBITDA to €259m. On adjusted basis (net of the tariff recovery in Q3-20) y/y EBITDA growth would be 7%. Higher DD&As driven by capex acceleration would mitigate the impact of EBITDA growth on the bottom line. Reported net profit would increase by 1% y/y €94m. On adjusted basis easy comparison would be double-digit, at 11%. Investments would continue the positive trend reported in the previous quarters, reaching €201m (+7% y/y). Net debt at the end of the period would be 6% higher than at end 2020, reaching €5.04bn. The increase would be mainly due to capex acceleration, dividend payments and the seasonal increase in working capital in Q3, which we expect to normalize by year-end.",Enrico Bartoli,Enrico Bartoli,6.02,,Hold,,EUR,0.45,,0.5,,0.29,0.32,,,,,M,STIFEL_Non-regulated revenues_FlashCoNote_Oct 25 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Non-regulated revenues_FlashCoNote_Oct 25 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=c457d012-161e-4314-98fc-a26d90d55f40&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
DIC GY,DIC,Nov 11 2021 06:31AM,DIC Asset,Real Estate,On track to achieve its 2021 FFO1 earnings guidance ,DIC Asset’s 9M21 results leave the company on track to achieve its 2021 FFO1earnings guidance. It has raised its rental income guidance as a result of a boost from its warehousing activities but confirmed its FFO guidance with the higher rental income offset by higher interest expenses. DIC Asset’s ability to maintain strong momentum in 2021 despite Covid restrictions underlines the benefits of its hybrid business model in our view. We reiterate our Buy rating and target price of €22.0 per share. ,"FFO1 earnings on track. DIC Asset has reported 9M21 FFO1 earnings of €79.6m (9M20: €72.7m). There was no consensus available but the company is on track to achieve its FY21 guidance at this stage of the year. Its FY21 FFO earnings guidance of €106-€110m (consensus: €108m) was reiterated, which was expected but is nevertheless reassuring in the Covid environment. The company increased its gross rental income guidance to €107-€108m (from €98-€102m previously) and confirmed its real estate management fees expectation of €94-€104m. Acquisitions. Covid has not prevented DIC Asset maintaining an active acquisition strategy, particularly for investors in its Institutional business. The company has acquired properties for €214m for the Commercial portfolio since the start of the year. This compares to FY21 guidance of €200-€300m for the Commercial portfolio. In the Institutional business, DIC Asset has signed acquisitions of €212m with another 2 properties held in Warehousing (€586m) compared to guidance of €1.0-€1.5bn for the Institutional business. The company has confirmed its 2021 guidance for acquisitions. Sales. DIC Asset has announced disposals of €25m at 9M21 for the Commercial portfolio and sales of €221m for the Institutional business.

Including earn outs, we assume around €150m in transaction value, which would value VINCORION at 8.6x EV/EBITDA (based on SFe 2021), which is in line with industry multiples. Jenoptik is selling the business to STAR Capital Partnership, a private equity firm. We deem the transaction as highly value accretive since the VINCORION division was dilutive to the story and overall valuation of the group. Closing of the transaction is scheduled for the second half of 2022, however the company will record VINCORION as assets held for sale effective as of now.

DIS IM,DIS,Nov 22 2021 12:59AM,d’Amico International Shipping S.A.,Industrials,One to look for into the winter season ,"What's changed? We have reviewed our three-year estimates post the 9M/3Q21results, including a new reporting methodology following the recently awarded bareboat charter-out contract. We also update our valuation for the mark-to-market of FX and vessel prices, as well as a new fleet profile. We confirm our Buy rating, lifting our PT to €0.16/share (from €0.15/share), based on higher vessel market values. e What's different? Spot market rates have remained below the break-even level in Q3. Nevertheless, according to the latest market data we follow, rates have been improving since the final weeks in October. Meanwhile, asset values, which are still well below cycle peaks, continued to recover in Q2 and Q3 at a time when the overall world fleet is getting older and a pick-up in scrapping is increasing, leading to slow fleet growth. e What to look at? With the oil demand recovery underway and global destocking approaching a trough, we believe we are now very close to an inflection point. Improving spot rates, as well as interesting contracts by charterers looking to secure cover in what is expected to be a stronger market, are an early bullish indicator. On this basis, we expect an improved Q4 and a good run through the winter, where other additional factors may be in play to provide a further boost to tonne-mile demand, such as an “energy crunch"" spill-over in the form of gas-to-oil switching for power generation, and typical winter weather disruptions and supply dislocations. ","Current news flow reflects improved sentiment: While Q3 results reflected very tough prevailing market conditions in the product tankers space, d'Amico still delivered an overall respectable set of results ahead of the crucial Q4. The recently signed agreement to bareboat charter-out the MT Cielo di Londra LR1 vessel to a well-regarded counterparty for five years at a very profitable rate (extendable for another two years at increasing rates) is a clear sign of the improving sentiment in the product tankers space, showing clients' commitment to pay higher prices upfront vis-a-vis still depressed spot rates ahead of a potential rebound in the market. Meanwhile, spot rates have shown some signs of soft improvement since the latest weeks of October. Promising outlook: A recovery in oil demand and refining throughputs is underway, with an acceleration anticipated over November and in particular December, while refined product inventories have rebalanced towards more normalised levels. Near-term demand is inflecting due to increased vehicle miles driven in several large consuming regions, as well as improving trends in jet fuel consumption (DIS’s percentage of jet-fuel transported on total volume increased from 3% in Q1 to 12.5% in Q3), not mentioning the role that oil could play in partially addressing the ongoing energy crunch, driving more volumes of fuel oil transportation during winter. More interestingly, while the demolition increase helps to keep fleet growth under control, asset values, which are still well below cycle peaks, continued to improve in Q2 and Q3 at a time when the overall world fleet is getting older and a pick-up in scrapping is increasing, leading to slow fleet growth. Valuation: We mark to market the EUR/USD FX and vessel prices for newbuild and secondhand, as well as updating the fleet profile, pricing in the cash from the MT High Venture in 4Q-21, and the bareboat charter-out contract on MT Cielo di Londra, coupled with lower operating and financial costs. A progressive normalisation in demand patterns, with the dislocation of oil product refining sites far from consumption hubs in addition to the limited fleet growth, should support a rate recovery over the midterm.",Daniele Alibrandi,Daniele Alibrandi,0.16,0.15,Buy,,USD,-0.02,,0.01,,0,0,,,,,M,STIFEL_One to_CoNote_Nov 22 2021 12-59AM.pdf,STIFEL_One to_CoNote_Nov 22 2021 12-59AM,EARNINGS UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=0fb17f29-5a24-4f14-b41a-f7e1332be093&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
RIEN SW,RIEN,Oct 22 2021 02:33AM,Rieter,Capital Goods,Outstanding order intake momentum continued in Q3-21 and fully supports our FY-22/23 investment case ,"After an extraordinary order intake increase of 290% to CHF 975m in H1-21, ordermomentum increased in Q3 by +301% to CHF 699m (excluding business from the Saurer activities and despite higher comps), which comes as a very positive surprise as the company expected a normalisation after the exceedingly strong H1-21. The increase in orders of 301%/294% in Q3/9M-21 supports our positive investment case that Rieter should experience not only a very strong FY-22, but the same for FY-23. ","The slightly lowered FY-21 sales guidance (about and not above CHF 900m — excluding any sales from the announced takeover of Saurer activities) is linked to the uncertainties in global supply chains and logistics. Our (and consensus) FY-21 sales forecast (SFe 993m) included Saurer activities for four months (SFe CHF 87m). However, Saurer sales will be consolidated for only one month at most. We feel very comfortable with our above-consensus sales assumptions for FY-22E and FY-23E, given today's announced order intake and order backlog of CHF 1,562m. Group 3Q/9M21 order intake amounted to CHF 699m / CHF 1674m (cons. CHF 321m / CHF 1,296m; SFe CHF 301m / CHF 1,276m): Group orders hence increased by 301% y-o-y for the quarter (SFe +72%) and 294% for the first 9 months of the year (SFe +200%). As in the first 6 months of the year, the order increase was based partially on a catch-up effect relating to the years 2019 and 2020. In addition, there is a regional shift in demand, linked to the development of costs in China, leading to increased investments outside the Chinese market. In general, strong orders came primarily from Turkey, Latin America, India, Pakistan and China. Order backlog increased to CHF 1,562m by the end of September: At mid year, the order backlog stood at CHF 1,135m. Machines & Systems with highest order intake growth: Orders went up by 438%/447% to CHF 567m/1,282m in Q3/9M-21 (SFe CHF 188m / CHF 903m). This compares to 453% in H1-21. A key driver of growth in the machinery business has been the demand for innovative complete systems in the areas of ring and compact spinning. Business group Components increased orders by 81%/95% to CHF 72m / CHF 227m in Q3/9M-21 (SFe CHF 77m / CHF 232m), and business group After Sales grew by 104% / 123% to CHF 60m / CHF 165m (SFe CHF 35m / CHF 141m): The successful commercialisation of the compacting devices and the piecing robot ROBOspin, launched in 2019, contributed to the increase in the Business Groups Components and After Sales. Reassuring update on the Saurer transaction: The acquisition of the three businesses from Saurer is proceeding according to plan. Slightly reduced FY-21 sales guidance does not include any Saurer business: So far, Rieter was guiding for sales to be above CHF 900m. The new guidance indicates about CHF 900m, reflecting uncertainties over bottlenecks in material deliveries and freight capacities as well as the ongoing pandemic in countries that are important for Rieter. Furthermore, Rieter again anticipates a normalisation of the demand for new systems in the coming months (actually Rieter expected that already three months ago, which did not happen, as seen in today's announced Q3 order intake). On the positive side, the company assumes now that spinning mills would continue to work not only at high-capacity levels but at full capacity.",Christian Arnold,Christian Arnold,260,,Buy,,CHF,4.76,,21.6,,3,9,,,,,M,STIFEL_Outstanding order_FlashCoNote_Oct 22 2021 02-33AM.pdf,STIFEL_Outstanding order_FlashCoNote_Oct 22 2021 02-33AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=16799c7f-bc6a-430f-919b-a7a2bffc5d80&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
CRH ID,CRH,Nov 18 2021 01:00AM,CRH PLC,Construction,Peer Pressure ,"The trading update next week should provide further upside, when looking atrecent peer results and share price performances. Add to that fairly positive October data in the US and other important markets, then the €50 share price mark, we alluded to earlier in the year, could well be on the cards. Clearly, there are negatives such as higher input costs and supply shortages. But then we expect further pricing upside, while the company is not known for under-managing its operations. At the end of the day, this remains a quality stock, still at a reasonable price. A dividend aristocrat that has performed year in, year out. Not something you can easily argue with. Still a Buy for us, albeit not with the upside potential of a Holcim (Buy, CHF48.45) over the next few years. ","Peer performances point to a strong trading update. CRH's peers in the US and Europe have all reported already (see Figure 3). The global average LFL sales and EBITDA growth on that basis was ~5% and ~3% respectively implying some margin dilution on the back of higher input costs. Taking these US and European LFLs as a reference, we expect CRH to deliver LFL sales and EBITDA growth of +5% and +1% respectively for Q3-21 (see Figure 2). More importantly, we feel quite comfortable with our FY-21 EBITDA estimate of USD5,158m (ex associates) vs Visible Alpha consensus at USD5,166m. Current trading remains positive. The latest US data for October points to further strength in underlying trading (see Figure 4), especially when it comes to pricing. Volumes remain supportive and should recover further into 2022. Clearly, input costs put a strain on margins, but we believe that some significant price increases have occurred recently. The picture in Europe also appears to move in the right direction, especially in the UK. Put these trends in context of its best-in-class operational management, then we remain more than confident with regard to its stock for now. Quality and growth at a reasonable price. At 8.6x 22E EV/EBITDA (pre IFRS16) the stock still trades slightly below its 30-year median of 8.9x (see Figure 6). With strong cash generation and a ND/EBITDA of ~0.5x 22E, this multiple goes down quickly into 2023, the year the US stimulus starts to have a more pronounced impact. The company is a long-term performer with a significant dividend track record going back to its formation in 1970. The Group last cut its dividend in 1983 and since then has delivered thirty-seven consecutive years of stable or increasing dividends (thirty-one of which were increases). Put this in context of a consistently strong balance sheet, then the Group has significant firepower for M&A, more share buy-backs and another rebased dividend. We believe dividend aristocrats may soon make a comeback, especially once overvalued growth stocks face higher discount rates.

ENEL IM,ENEL,Nov 01 2021 02:00AM,Enel,Utilities,Perfect storm for Enel Chile in Q3-21 ,"On Friday, Enel Chile (ENIC US, not rated), Enel's subsidiary operating in theChilean market, reported Q3/9M-21 results. Q3-21 was severely penalized by several exceptionally negative market conditions, which forced the company to lower FY-21 EBITDA guidance to US$0.8-0.9bn from US$1.1-1.2bn. Adjusted EBITDA declined by -71% y/y. EBITDA in the power generation business was 82% lower than in Q3-20 due to: 1) exceptionally low hydro volumes; 2) stoppage of natural gas imports from Argentina; and 3) a sharp rise in international LNG prices. In Q3-21 the company reported a net loss. Net debt increased by 26% versus end 2020, mainly due to capex acceleration, dividend payments in the period and lower FFO than in the same period of 2020. ","Enel Chile's results are consistent with our estimate for Enel's Q3-21 EBITDA in the Latin American business (Enel is publishing Q3/9M-21 results on 4 November, please refer to our note published on 27 October). In our opinion, the exceptionally negative market conditions that materialized in Q3-21 in Chile are not structural. Hydro volumes and gas imports are likely to normalize in 2022. Nevertheless, the reduced guidance for Enel Chile's 2021 EBITDA will have a negative impact on our estimate for Enel's FY-21 EBITDA. In our opinion, Enel's share price has been excessively penalized in the recent months by the increased regulatory risk in Spain. We believe the current share price is not properly reflecting Enel's value creation potential arising from its position as global leader in renewables and its exposure to energy transition. The stock trades at what we view as attractive multiples, and it offers visible dividend yields in excess of 5%. Enel Chile's detailed results in Q3-21 are as follows: Adjusted EBITDA declined by 71% y/y to US$93m. The tough comparison was due to the power generation business, whose EBITDA dropped by 82% y/y to US$51m. Q3-21 was penalized by several negative factors: 1) power generation volumes declined by 8% y/y, mainly due to lower hydro production due to historically low rainfalls; 2) import of low-price natural gas from Argentina was suspended in the period, which had to be replaced by more expensive LNG volumes; and 3) the sharp rise in international gas prices drove surging LNG prices in Chile. EBITDA from the distribution business increased by 7% y/y to US$48m. As a result of the still low level of hydro reservoirs and high gas procurement costs, Enel Chile revised downward its guidance for 2021 EBITDA to US$0.8-09bn from US $1.1-1.2bn. Enel Chile's management anticipates that gas supply from Argentina is expected to restart in Q4-21. Enel Chile reported a net loss of US$13m (versus a net profit of US$142m in Q3-20). On top of the drop in EBITDA, the bottom line was penalized by the accounting for the factoring of regulatory receivables related to the stabilization mechanism. e@ Capex declined by 16% y/y to US$237m. Nevertheless, in 9M-21 it was up by 15% versus the same period of 2020 to US$735m. Capex acceleration is mainly linked to the installation of new renewable capacity. The company anticipates that 1.3GW of new wind and solar plants under construction will start operation by 2023. Those installations would almost double Enel Chile's current 1.7GW capacity in those tect nologies. Net debt incrased by 26% versus end 2020 to US$4.44bn. The increase was mainly due to dividend payments in the period, capex acceleration and increasing working capital due to the new billing system (the latter impact is expected to be reduced by year end).",Enrico Bartoli,Enrico Bartoli,9.2,,Buy,,EUR,0.52,,0.54,,0.38,0.4,,,,,M,STIFEL_Perfect storm_FlashCoNote_Nov 01 2021 02-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Perfect storm_FlashCoNote_Nov 01 2021 02-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=6f9fd336-8b5b-4aa1-b602-803cfa5492f1&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
CEM IM,CEM,Nov 12 2021 06:00AM,Cementir Holding NV,SPONSORED RESEARCH Building Materials,Piling Cash ,"Cementir delivered a solid quarter with Q3-21 results largely in line with our and consensusexpectations, which given the current cost pressures, should be considered more than reassuring. More importantly, cash generation was exceptionally strong, leading to a significant reduction in Net Debt. Management confirmed its FY-21 revenue and EBITDA guidance, as well as on Net Debt. Given the strong cash generation and early conclusion of the buyback, the Net Debt target appears to be within easy reach and could be beaten comfortably, in our view. The fast deleveraging in conjunction with the roll-over of our valuation to 2022 should leave space for more upside from here. ","A solid set of Q3-21 results, in line with expectations. Cementir reported a solid set of Q3-21 results supported by normalising volumes (cement -7.5%, RMC +3.5%, aggregates +6.5%) with sales up +5% YonY to €344m (vs Stifel and consensus estimates at €349m). Q3-21 EBITDA increased +2% YonY to €82m (vs Stifel and consensus estimates at €82m), in line with expectations. The main deviation from the top line came from Turkey, which was impacted by lower volumes in July and September due to bad weather. That said, the underlying market remained solid, particularly the domestic one, driven by strong demand for real estate. We also flag improved trading in Denmark in all business lines and still strong trends for white cement in both domestic and export markets in Egypt. e@ FY-21 guidance was confirmed, but strong cash generation surprised on the upside. Management confirmed its FY-21 guidance for revenues (~€1.35bn), EBITDA (€295-305m), and Net Debt (~€30m). However, we cannot help noting that free cash generation during the 9M has remained exceptionally strong, leading to a reduction of €118m YoY in Net Debt to €100m, and this despite a ~€29m share buyback. In the absence of major disruption in the currency market (namely appreciation of the Turkish Lira), we think the company is on track to possibly exceed its annual targets. Investors should note that the Group generated €96m and €107m of cash during the final quarter in 2020 and 2019 respectively. A healthy balance sheet suggests M&A is still on the cards. Timing remains uncertain, but opportunities could arise with the industry under pressure to reduce its CO? footprint in Europe. Cementir's balance sheet now looks particularly strong, which should increase the Group's optionality around M&A. On the one hand, higher CO costs impact the valuation exercise of some assets, especially in Europe. On the other hand, this could accelerate further divestments from major operators seeking to optimise their portfolios. The latest Spanish divestment of HeidelbergCement (HEI GY, Buy, €65.70, covered by Tobias Woerner) is such an example. Mature markets remain a key focus for the Group, while potential greenfield expansion is under consideration in Asia. Deserving of a re-rating. Today, we believe Cementir is in much better shape than ever and hence deserves a re-rating, in our view. Structurally higher margins and returns should result in higher EV/Sales multiple and EV/IC. Its EV/sales at 1x 22E sit below the long-term median at ~1.1x, with scope for this valuation metric to expand to at least 1.3x. This is far from aggressive, as its EBITDA margin at 20.4% 21E (pre IFRS16) is slightly ahead of its long-term median (at 19.4%). Previous peaks (at >25%) saw this multiple expand to as much as 2x, which would imply share price of >€15. The ROIC at 11.9% 22E vs the long-term median at 5.8% underlines this point.

VOW3 GY,VOW3,Dec 10 2021 02:03AM,Volkswagen AG,Automotive,Planning Round 70: no major surprises but positive wording around current trading ,"The outcomes of the 5 year planning round were announced yesterday. Key pointsare that CEO Diess remains on board (but loses responsibilities for VW brand and China). The FCF targets for 2025/2026 were lifted to >EUR15bn per year. The wording for FCF in Q4 2021 improved. While the personnel decisions seem rather a compromise than a strategy, the commentary around Q4 is encouraging. ","Personnel: CEO Diess remains on board, but loses responsibility for the VW brand (but keeps responsibility for 'Volume Brand Group' - itis complicated). Diess assumes responsibility for 'Cariad', the software division (while VW also appointed a new board member in charge of IT). Ralf Brandstatter becomes head of VW brand from January 2022 and head of the China division from August 2022, both were responsibilities of CEO Diess before. Overall: fewer responsibilities for Diess and Audi CEO Duesmann, more for Ralf Brandstatter, Hildegard Wortmann (new head of Group Sales) and a new contract for head of HR Gunnar Kilian. The new board responsibilities look a bit like a compromise to please all stakeholders. 2025/2026: the strategic margin target of 8-9% has been reiterated. CAPEX and development cost are to be trimmed to 11%. The target for free cash flow was increased from >EUR10bn to EUR>15bn. That was not a major surprise, VW had adjusted the margin targets earlier but had not adjusted FCF targets yet. Still, >EUR15bn in annual FCF is a very ambitious target (and makes it difficult to argue why a Porsche IPO would be needed to fund the transition). Q4 2021: VW confirmed that the upper end of the margin range of 6-7.5% is expected (we assume 7.6%). VW increased the wording for the 2021 FCF outlook (>EUR15bn - that was lowered only recently with the Q3 reporting). This implies that current trading is rather good.

CFR SW,CFR,Nov 12 2021 02:31AM,Richemont,Consumer Goods,Plenty of good news today with impressive 1H22 results and YNAP announcement ,"Richemont reported much better-than-expected 1H21 results powered by the all-important Jewellery Maisons (+39% two-year growth in Q2 and 37.9% margin) and better-than-expected performance across all other divisions and across all regions, resulting in +65% sales growth at CER (vs. 60% consensus) and €1.95bn EBIT more than 30% ahead of consensus thanks to stronger-than-expected margin performance (21.9% margin vs. 17.4% consensus). ","Richemont also announced today that is in advanced talks with Farfetch to create neutral industry-wide platform in which Farfetch will invest directly in YNAP as minority shareholder, YNAP will leverage Farfetch Platform Solutions to support its transition to a hybrid model and Richemont Maisons will join Farfetch marketplace and leverage Farfetch technology for their Maisons. This should be very well-received today as YNAP operating performance in recent years has held back Richemont’s strong hard luxury equity story. Details: The all-important Jewellery Maisons sustained their strong top-line momentum in Q2 (+69% at CER vs. +66% consensus, with +30% y-o-y or +39% two-year growth in Q2 vs. +43% two-year growth in Q1) and operating margin performance was well above consensus (37.9% vs. 33.5% consensus). All other product divisions beat consensus for both sales and margins: Specialist Watchmakers (+47% growth at CER in H1 vs. +44% consensus, +35% in Q2, 22.4% margin), Online Distributors (+39% vs. +37% consensus in H1, +11% in Q2, -€141m loss) and Other Maisons (+74% vs. +55% consensus, +45% in Q2, 3.1% margin). Allregions came better than expected, with Q2 growth driven by continued strength in Americas (+58% at CER), improving trends in Europe (+38%) and sustained double- digit growth in Asia Pacific (+17%) and Japan (+20%). Gross margin better than expected (63.3% vs. 61.4% consensus) thanks to improved manufacturing utilisation, favourable geographical mix and higher share of retail. Operating leverage (opex up 36% vs. sales growth in excess of 60%) drove the opex sales ratio down to 41.4% and contributed to the significant margin beat (21.9% margin vs. 17.4% consensus).

KRN GY,KRN,Nov 16 2021 07:39AM,Krones,Industrials,Popping the cork: new FY-22 and FY-25 targets clearly above ,"Krones hosts its CMD today: initial reaction should be positive. Krones pullsforward its old mid-term targets by one entire year and announces new FY-25 mid-term targets (>EUR 4.5bn in sales, EBITDA margin 10-13%). We see c.10% consensus EBITDA upside pressure in both FY-22 and FY-25. Buy strongly reiterated. Krones is part of our three top picks for 2021: with a much stronger and earlier end-market recovery, we expect focus to shift even more to self-help and margin potential. Note we are delighted to host Krones CFO Norbert Broger as part of our Stifel Industrial fireside chat series on 15 December. ","Key points: #1 Newgroup FY-25 midterm guidance: Krones released new mid-term targets with FY-25 organic sales target of >EUR 4.5bn (implying a >5% organic sales growth CAGR) and an EBITDA margin of 10-13% (we estimate this implies sales of c.EUR 4.7bn and EBITDA of EUR 540m at mid-point). Krones implies this guidance was built with some extra cushioning (sum of segment guidance actually is higher), “would not wait until 2025 if can be achieved earlier’. Krones now also guides to achieve its old mid-term targets one-year earlier. Krones, in its previous mid-term targets at the mid- point in FY 21-23, was aiming for sales of EUR 3.35/3.55/3.85bn and EBITDA of EUR 235/300/400m (margins of 7.0/8.5/10.5%). #2 Consensus EBITDA to see c.10% upside pressure: Bloomberg consensus expects FY-22 sales of EUR 3.92bn and EBITDA of EUR 365m (c.9.5% margin) and FY-25 sales of EUR 4.67bn and EBITDA of EUR 492m (10.5% margin). We see c.10% consensus EBITDA upside pressure in both years. #3 FY-21 outlook unchanged, consensus looks plausible: Krones guides for organic sales growth of 7-9% (we estimate this implies a mid-point of c.EUR 3.59bn, higher-end EUR 3.62bn). EBITDA margin of 7-8% (we estimate the mid-point implies c.EUR 270m, higher-end c.EUR 290m). Krones previously commented it will reach the upper end of sales and margins guidance and it would be well in range for the EUR 4.1bn record order intake in 2019. Consensus expects FY-21 sales of EUR 3.59bn and an EBITDA of EUR 290m (our estimate is EUR 295m).

LXS GY,LXS,Nov 11 2021 08:23AM,Lanxess,Chemicals,Portfolio changes to continue ,"Lanxess has announced it will transfer its High Performance Materials businessunit (HPM) (PA6 and PBT value chain) to an independent legal structure. The company intends to have more flexibility in the dynamically changing market environment. While not specifically mentioned, these carve-out processes usually result in an exit of the business. DSM might consider a similar move for its Engineering Materials division, which is probably the closest peer to Lanxess. HPM is the most cyclical part in the current Lanxess portfolio. While being only c.20% of group sales, it was responsible for c.50% of the y/y EBITDA decline in 2020. The CEO already highlighted on the Q2 conference call that major portfolio changes are ongoing. After two large acquisitions, he also indicated that the next M&A moves might be on the disposal side. With the announcement today, HPM could be one such divestment candidate. We assume that Rheinchemie and ","Inorganic Pigments do not fit with a specialty chemical company either. Note, however, we do not have any knowledge of any specific divestiture plans in this regard. HPM comprises the integrated PA6/PBT value chain. Lanxess has a 240kt caprolactam plant in Antwerp. There is little exposure to the merchant market, as most of it is used as internal supply for the two 100kt plants in Antwerp and Krefeld/Uerdingen. In PBT, Lanxess is backward integrated with a JV with DuPont in Hamm (Germany). The main end-customer industries are automotive in the case of PA6 and electronics for PBT. Over the last decade, Lanxess invested in adding compounding capacities around the globe: US (Gastonia), Porto Felice (Brazil), Wuxi (China) and Jhagadia (India), but by far the largest capacity is in Krefeld/Uerdingen. The internal use for compounding is significantly >50%. In 2021, we estimate sales to be c.EUR 1.3bn with an EBITDA margin of 15%, which is below that of peers, in our view. In out SOTP model, we use 6.4x EV/EBITDA for the valuation, but would assume the disposal multiple to be at >8x, i.e. EUR >1.5bn. Rheinchemie is already a legal independent entity. It comprises the specialty rubber chemical additives and the commodities (accelerators, antioxidants). The more interesting business with colorants (sales c.EUR 100m) were separated from Rheinchemie. We assume sales to be at EUR 0.6bn with a rather low EBITDA margin of 6-7%. We value the business in our SOTP model at c.EUR 0.3bn. As Rheinchemie is already a legal separate entity, we would expect this transaction to be even ahead of potential HPM exit. Inorganic Pigments also does not fit with a specialty chemical company. Lanxess is by far market leader. Sales are close to EUR 500m, in our view. At the peak in 2015/16, the EBITDA margin was probably >20%, but it might be only at 13-14% in 2021, according to our assumptions. The business is strongly affected by the high energy costs and announced several price increases this year to offset the headwind of cost inflation. We assume the business to grow <GDP with limited innovation potential. In our SOTP model, we value the business at EUR 0.5bn. A potential M&A move might come after the two mentioned above. The combined divestiture proceeds of these potential exit candidates could result in an inflow of c.EUR 2.5bn, more than spent for the two recent acquisitions in Consumer Protection, Emerald Kalama and IFF Biocides, of a combined c.EUR 2bn. The potential exit candidates have below group average margins and have higher-than-average cyclicality. The group's earnings profile would therefore greatly improve.",Andreas Heine,Andreas Heine;Isha Sharma,69,,Hold,,EUR,4.43,,5.28,,1.05,1.1,,,,,M,STIFEL_Portfolio changes_FlashCoNote_Nov 11 2021 08-23AM.pdf,STIFEL_Portfolio changes_FlashCoNote_Nov 11 2021 08-23AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=a02f4c4b-51b4-4d85-8a4c-1d39ee1f2405&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
EOAN GY,EOAN,Nov 10 2021 02:34AM,E.ON,Utilities,Positive set of Q3-21 results. More to come at the CMD on November 23 ,"Conclusion: overall positive set of Q3-21 results. Customer Solutions continues to bethe main driver over 9M-21, especially thanks to the restructuring of the U.K business, where FCF of the unit is €232m vs €31m in 9M-20. Leverage is on a good trend, at 4.5x LTM EBITDA. Very simple set of results with no detailed information on the segments, because E.ON holds a CMD on November 23. In our view, two main topics of the CMD should be: 1) risk of margin squeeze in Customer Solutions due to rising electricity and gas prices in Europe, and 2) long-term prospects in Networks. No analyst call today. ","Key KPIs over 9M-21: Adj. EBITDA is in line with consensus at €6,277m (+26% y/ y), adj. EBIT is 1.1% above consensus at €3,928m (+46% y/y) and adj. net income is 5.5% above consensus at €2,200m (+102% y/y). Net debt stands at €37.17bn (FY-20: €40.7bn) or 4.5x LTM EBITDA (FY-20: 5.9x). UK restructuring still on the right path: with an EBIT of €209m vs €-2m in 9M-20, the restructuring of the UK Customer Solutions unit continues to bear fruit. The guidance of £100m in FY-21 looks achievable. The unit is FCF positive at €232m (9M-20: €31m). EBIT drivers by segment: Networks: EBIT up by €85m (+4% y/y) due to normalized weather and the non- recurrence of negative effects from the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as the full- year consolidation of VSEH in CEE & Turkey. Customer Solutions: EBIT up €515m (+133% y/y) mainly due to cooler weather, restructuring benefits in the U.K and synergies in Germany. Non-Core: EBIT up by €562m (+189% y/y) mainly due to legislative approval of nuclear production rights agreement (~€550m). Guidance for 2021 is confirmed: E.ON guides for an EBITDA range of €7.6-7.8bn, an EBIT range of €4.4-4.6bn and an adjusted net income range of €2.2-2.4bn. 2021-2023 targets are confirmed: excluding the effect of the nuclear agreement, E.ON expects an EBITDA CAGR of 2-3%, an EBIT CAGR of 8-10%, an EPS CAGR of 12-14%, dividend growth of up to 5% and a leverage factor (ND/EBITDA) of 4.8-5.2x.

SIX2 GY,SIX2,Nov 15 2021 01:43PM,Sixt SE,Transportation,Positive view maintained on strong pricing ,"Q3 finals on Thursday revealed stronger RPD of 2.3% relative to our forecast,compensating for higher OPEX. Furthermore, depreciation per vehicle was very low. e We think pricing was strong and potentially better across all segments, and that the US lagged our expectations on short vehicle supply. Most likely there is no other structural issue present. The Q3 US corporate EBITDA margin was very strong, at 37%. e Pricing should be the short-term driver, and we now believe that the 2021E outlook could be achieved at the upper end of €450m. Our upgraded EBT 2021-2023E forecasts (raised by 27%/8%/3%) support a higher target price of €177 (€165). We reiterate our Buy rating. ","Q3 review - even higher RPD Recall that on 20 October, management released EBT of €253m for the third quarter, which was a new record due to a strong and unprecedented pricing dynamic. While this figure was confirmed with the finals, our review of the P&L revealed that the company showed a bit higher OPEX, offset by a new all-time-high gross margin of 80.7%. While fleet expenses have not been the reason for it, RPD was actually about €1.25 higher in the quarter than in our forecast (€53.45 vs. €52.27). Surprise factor was Europe Whereas one could argue that the US top line was the fly in the ointment - we expected sales well above €200m while the Q3 actual was 'only' €175.5m - Europe ex Germany surprised substantially with strong sales of €370.5m (SFe: €295.9m). We think that in general, the estimation error was high this time on the unprecedented price dynamic. We think the US deviation was probably on fleet (Sixt does not disclose regional fleet / pricing KPIs), and the upside in the Europe segment was likely on pricing. Recovery of business and pricing likely to stay strong Management spoke of strong demand for mobility that continued into the autumn, particularly in the US and in European markets. Sixt stated that the business travel segment has also shown a clear recovery: global B2B revenues in August and September 2021 were already higher than in the same periods in 2019. EBT forecasts upgraded We increased our EBT 2021-2023E forecasts by 27%/8%/3%. We now believe that Sixt's 2021 EBT outlook could be achieved at the upper-end of the confirmed range of €390m- €450m (implicit 17.0%-21.4% margin, on sales of €2.1bn-€2.3bn). Our new estimates put us 9% ahead of the Street on pretax profit for 2021E, in line with 2023E, but 3.5% below 2022E. Reiterate Buy, TP moves up to €177 (€165) Still, the US business should be the most prominent growth driver and for that reason, special attention is given to the segment. However, we think that the fleet scarcity issue is a temporary one, although it may persist for a couple of quarters. In principle, we do not infer that general market demand is an issue. We think that quite the opposite is the case; in particular, support should be coming from Europe-to-US-travel, just made possible as of 8 November. Our upgraded model assumptions allow for an increase in the TP to €177 from €165. Consequently, we reiterate our Buy rating.",Adrian Pehl,"Adrian Pehl, CFA",177,165,Buy,,EUR,7.19,,6.79,,3.59,3.39,,,,,M,STIFEL_Positive view_CoNote_Nov 15 2021 01-43PM.pdf,STIFEL_Positive view_CoNote_Nov 15 2021 01-43PM,EARNINGS UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=227efc93-e5ff-4c18-a340-589dcd89572d&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
JEN GY,JEN,Nov 11 2021 01:00AM,Jenoptik,Industrials,Post Q3 Update: Light & Optics on track ,Jenoptik reported Q3 results with a significant beat on consensus EBITestimates; Light & Optics continues to be the main driver. e Light & Production picks up momentum again and prints strong earnings on the back of project payments. e We consider Jenoptik to be well on track and reiterate our Hold rating with an increased price target of €34 (previously €29). ,"Light & Optics keeps its stellar position - other divisions gain momentum Jenoptik reported strong Q3 numbers with €220m in revenue and €48m in EBITDA, -0.2% and +29% compared to our estimates, and -0.3% and +17% compared to consensus. Similar to Q2, the main reason for the strong performance was the Light & Optics division, which continues to benefit from (1) increased demand for semiconductor equipment and biophotonics solutions and (2) the Trioptics acquisition last year. This bodes well for the planned acquisition of Berliner Glas Medical and SwissOptic that strengthen the Light & Optics division in the attractive semiconductor and biophotonics industries. On the back of the improved profitability and overall outlook, we increase our 2021E estimates by 0.7% and 19% for revenue and EBITDA, respectively. Going forward, we increase our margin assumptions for Light & Optics and account for the recent acquisitions. This increases 2022E as well as 2023E revenue and EBITDA estimates by 15% and 25%, respectively. We welcome the improved development in Light & Optics and especially the further strengthening of that segment via the latest acquisitions. Still, we believe the most value would be created if the company would fully focus on the Light & Optics business. First and foremost, a VINCORION divestment is mandatory, in our view. We appreciate the recent developments, increase our price target to €34 (from €29) and keep our Hold rating. Conference call with some criticism but overall neutral There has been some criticism on overall margin development after one-offs and the overall amount of one-offs. Besides that, in our view management continues to show confidence amid a clear improvement in profitability. Our key takeaways are: Light & Optics is particularly strong in the semiconductor industry as well as biophotonics, but other areas show strong development across the board. The company faces supply chain issues; however, compared to other companies we see it as rather well manageable. Management is confident Jenoptik can reach €1bn order intake in 2021E. Hold rating confirmed and increased price target of €34 (was €29) We use a 50:50 mix of DCF analysis and peer group multiples to derive our €34.00 price target. In our DCF analysis, we derive a €42.00 implied equity value with a beta of 1.2, 2% terminal growth rate and a 7.5% WACC. The EV/EBIT target multiple for 2022E is derived from the median of a diverse peer group. The 12.3x EV/EBIT multiple for 2022E results in a €27.00 implied equity value.

","Strong Q3, but difficult raw materials and logistics environment va-Q-tec further boosted its business in Q3 and beat our revenue estimate by 2.2%. However, due to still difficult logistics and partly material pricing environment, EBITDA at €4.4m was €0.8m short of our expectations. While the company looks confident into the future in general (and we share that view) we are a little more pessimistic on near- term profitability. We strongly believe that the company will focus on profitability next year, we also believe that current logistic costs headwinds will persists for the time being. Consequently, we adjust our 2021E EBITDA estimate by 8.7% and our 2022E EBITDA estimate by 13%. We believe that our above consensus estimate for revenues and EBITDA estimates will hold true and the company will be able to print long-term high growth rates on the back of its business model. The Services segment, in particular, should come back as the main growth driver for the company going forward. Conference call feedback sparks optimism into 2022E The management team was confident about keeping the current pace and momentum into 2022E. Our key takes: e@ va-Q-tec is able to pass on most of the raw material price increases to its customers and is confident this will offset the logistics headwinds going forward, as well. Vaccine distribution should be a key thriver going forward as now most countries that didn't get vaccines previously see rising shipments. This should support, among other things, the currently somewhat lacklustre development in the Services business that already sees an uptick. Buy recommendation and €46 price target reiterated The investment case is fully intact and the management call following the Q2 results bodes well for very strong momentum in the remainder of the year. We use a 50:50 mix of DCF analysis and peer-group derived 2022E EV/EBITDA multiples to arrive at our new €46 price target.

AIR FP,AIR,Nov 01 2021 02:19AM,Airbus,Aerospace & Defence,Powering Through Headwinds ,"We reiterate our Buy rating on Airbus shares, keep our €155 PT (implying a+25% TSR), and leave EPS estimates unchanged following good Q3-21 Results on Thursday, 28 October. e A7% “EBIT Adjusted” beat vs consensus, driven by Eliminations and margins at Helicopters and Commercial Aircraft, an increase to guidance to a level that whilst it is only in-line for EBIT and 9% below for FCF, still appears to us to be conservative, and a moderate FCF beat in the quarter make a good performance, in our view. It shows the benefit of good cost control and supply chain management, and richening mix (more A320neo Family), as well as Airbus' continued caution as to pacing of deliveries and cashflows in FY-21. e Overall, we see it as a small positive for our thesis that Airbus is a revenue and cashflow recovery story, benefiting from the faster pace of recovery of domestic and narrow-body traffic and its leading market share in that segment. e The modest share price reaction (up +2% on Thursday) illustrates, in our view, that Q3 was perhaps not as weak as feared and the guidance increase surprised positively. We continue to see potential for consensus to rise materially, and for a pick-up in orders or delivery acceleration requests to support its trading multiple. e YTD, Airbus shares are up 23%, vs +23% for the CAC 40 index, and +13% for the Stoxx A&D index. Airbus trades around the upper middle of European A&D on P/ E or EV/FCF, though high vs its history, which we see as justified by the potential for a very strong EPS recovery CAGR of 75% (FY-20 to FY-23), benefiting from a depressed FY-20 base, and low reinvestment requirements in the medium-term (and thus higher cash conversion). ","Key Positives & Negatives The A330 production rate is to rise to ""Almost 3"" per month at the end of 2022 (vs 2/month at present), although this is partly offset, in our view, by a slight delay to the production rate increase on the A350. The inventory of built, but undelivered, aircraft is now ""Slightly below 100"", and on the call, the CFO implied that there was no inventory build in Q3-21. On China, the CEO expects roughly 20% of FY-21 deliveries to go to China, and at some point, Chinese airlines will have to order so that they can get access to delivery slots. There have been production issues with a number of suppliers, although the number of suppliers on watch had not changed significantly since end of Q1, and overall, ""The supply chain is at the rendez-vous"", according to the CEO. Some R&D expenses have moved in their timing to FY-22 from FY-21, so part of the €500m increase to FY-21 ""EBIT Adjusted"" guidance is due to this timing issue. EPS Estimates Unchanged Our “EPS Adjusted” estimates are €4.00 (2021E, unchanged vs €4.00 previously) and €5.30 (2022E, unchanged vs €5.30 previously). These are in-line / +4% above current \/B/E/S median consensus of €4.00 / €5.12 respectively.

EVT GY,EVT,Oct 26 2021 02:55AM,Evotec SE,Biotechnology,Preliminary 9M 2021 results with no surprises ,"Evotec released preliminary 9M 2021 financial results this morning, which arebroadly in line with our as well as market expectations. 9M 2021 group revenue is in the range €425m-435m, representing 24-27% underlying yoy growth. Adj group EBITDA is between €68m to 72m (12-18% underlying yoy growth). ","Today's press release does not mention the FY 2021 guidance.

EBITDA at the lower end of a range between €105m and €120m) is still valid and within reach. In our view, the timing of the pre-release of Q3 results may be related to management's intention for a Nasdaq listing of Evotec shares this year. Evotec filed a registration statement on Form F-1 with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on 11 October relating to a proposed offering and sale in the United States of shares of Evotec represented by American Depositary Shares. e@ We keep our Hold rating and €38.50 PT on Evotec shares.

D6H GR,D6H,Dec 07 2021 11:44AM,DATAGROUP,IT Services,Preliminary FY21 figures confirm the growth path ,"We update our estimates post robust prelims for FY21 (ending in September)that confirm our positive stance on the growth story. Organic growth came in at a record 7.7% due to strong performance across the group. e@ The margin expansion story remains intact: The EBIT margin is 6.5% according to the prelims, and we continue to see potential to reach the 9% target in the next two years. e We leave our sales estimates for 2022 / 2023 broadly unchanged, while our EBIT forecasts increase by 1.1% / 3.7% to reflect higher productivity in a “new normal” environment. e@ We confirm our Buy rating with an increased price target of €96 (was €86) on higher peer multiples and increased mid to long-term estimates. ","Record organic growth in 2021 Datagroup posted a 7.7% organic growth rate, according to the prelims for the FY ending in September. There were numerous drivers: strong operational performance of the large Datagroup entities, a dynamic recovery of the RPA subsidiary Almato, and robust development of newly generated business in the financial services and banking unit. The total share of revenues from these two industries totals ~20% as the restructuring of the former Financial IT Services unit has progressed successfully in 2021. EBITDA came in at €67.3m, after €42m in the previous year, for a margin of 15.1%. As a reminder, last year's earnings were heavily impacted by the pandemic and delayed start-ups in the banking sector. The share of services remains on a high level of 84.4% (last year: 85.1%). Hardware sales were driven by large vaccination centre projects earlier this year, thereby slightly reducing the services share. After the successful past fiscal year, the company intends to return to its historical dividend policy and propose a distribution ratio of c.40% of net profits. Dynamic growth should continue into 2022 Looking into 2022 and beyond, we remain optimistic as all drivers remain intact, in our view: Most importantly, the strong digitisation efforts among German SMEs and public authorities continues. Datagroup's core business with the CORBOX portfolio was further enriched by recent acquisitions (URANO and dna) and enjoys high demand as companies adapt their IT environments in light of rapid change. We recently met the new CFO, Oliver Thome, and view him as a strong addition to the management team (started 1 October). One of the focus areas will be to improve the investment (lower capital intensity) and depreciation ratios. One driver is a “decline in required office space driven by new ways of working that involve more flexible work”. We believe that the split between inorganic and organic growth could move closer to 50/50, after M&A accounted for ~2/3 of growth since the IPO in 2006. Valuation & catalysts We value Datagroup using a blend of DCF and peer group valuation methods. Our DCF analysis (50% weight) yields a value of €95 per share, while the multiple-based analysis implies a value of €97 per share. We expect a continuation of the strong operational performance going into 2022. The main risks include a setback in the restructuring of FIS, integration issues at recent M&A deals, and sluggish pickup of margins in the next quarters.",Yannik Siering,Yannik Siering,96,86,Buy,,EUR,2.52,,3.25,,1,1.15,,,,,M,STIFEL_Preliminary FY21_CoNote_Dec 07 2021 11-44AM.pdf,STIFEL_Preliminary FY21_CoNote_Dec 07 2021 11-44AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=3625c51f-ee0f-4bf6-96ad-83cb4e4aa61b&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
WCH GY,WCH,Nov 02 2021 06:00AM,Wacker Chemie AG,Chemicals,Price target up to €203 ,"New price target of €203 (previously: €193) reflects higher earnings estimates,stronger FCF and lower pension provisions. e Our 2021 EBITDA forecast is at the upper end of guidance of €1.2-1.4bn. 2022 EBITDA might get close to this level. e We expect Polysilicon to have another strong year in 2022. e Including Siltronic proceeds, net cash might be at €>2bn FY-22 as high as the pension provisions. ","Polysilicon margins should stay high in 2022: Our Q4-21 forecast of €200m EBITDA is aligned with the guidance of c.€600m for the full year. However, assuming current prices, costs would have to increase by 50% q/q for the anticipated earnings level. We therefore see some upside risk. According to Wacker, demand is remaining strong even at current elevated prices. Rising global demand and energy shortages in China speak for an ongoing tight market in 2022. It may also put into question whether the announced new capacities will come on-stream on schedule. Currently, solar grades have higher prices than semiconductor grades. Consequently, we expect higher quality semiconductor contract prices to follow solar prices in contracts for 2022. However, Wacker might experience materially higher Si-metal and energy costs, which we do not expect to be offset in full by further price moves resulting in probably lower earnings. We expect Polysilicon EBITDA to come down from €>600m this year to €>400m in 2022. Polymers EBITDA was the positive surprise in Q3 triggering higher earnings estimates: The higher than expected Q3 EBITDA and the guidance of 16% for FY-21 translate to a 20% higher forecast for this year. As 2021 was a tough year with materially higher VAM raw material costs, we do not expect the margin to be lower in 2022. Positive volume and mix effects speak for even higher earnings, which explain our +10% increase for 2022. Silicones with lower forecast for 2021 but higher for 2022: Silicones’ production is materially affected by a shutdown in Nunchritz and planned maintenance in Burghausen and China. The impact might add up to €50m headwind in Q4. This should not happen again in 2022. We expect continuous strong demand in specialty silicones and enough pricing power to deal with cost inflation. The EBITDA margin should stay close to 20%, and we expect EBITDA to increase +10% y/y in 2022. Adjusted for the impact of the plant shutdown in Q4-21, our forecast means flat earnings y/y. Energy prices are hedged on a rolling base. 50% are already hedged for 2022. However, the open position for Q4 alone represents a c.€50m cost increase. In 2021, headwinds will be €>400m (mainly VAM at Polymers), but Wacker might deliver €>700m EBITDA increase. We are hopeful that the next cost wave from higher Si-metal and energy costs (affecting Silicones and Polysilicon) can also be managed. Wacker recently announced +30% price increases for silicones and current polysilicon prices are significantly above 2021 ASP. Valuation benefits from strong FCF and lower provisions: Wacker generated €765m FCF in 9M-21, rising potentially to close to €1bn for the full year. The net cash pile might be €>700m by year-end. Pension provisions fell by €550m YTD and could come down more with rising interest rates. Both balance sheet items plus slightly higher earnings estimates explain the higher price target, which is derived from the average of five different valuation metrics. The different valuation metrics all show significant upside",Andreas Heine,from the current share price;Andreas Heine;Isha Sharma,203,193,Buy,,EUR,14.4,,13.5,,6,5.5,,,,,M,STIFEL_Price target_CoNote_Nov 02 2021 06-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Price target_CoNote_Nov 02 2021 06-00AM,EARNINGS UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=833f84f8-d949-4517-af97-7f3c42dd0d12&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
XTP PW,XTP,Nov 26 2021 06:54AM,XTPL,SPONSORED RESEARCH Technology Hardware,Printer sales are gaining traction and industrial projects progressing well ,"XTPL reported Q3 results on 25 November and held a respective conference callon 26 November. We believe these are further signs of strong cost management and the reliability of management announcements. The company is well on track to deliver further Delta Printer systems in Q4 2021E and upcoming quarters. After one signed contract in Q3, the company could announce another two sales for its Delta Printer in November alone. Without surprises, the company remains on its track towards commercialisation. ","XTPL continues to list nine projects at Stage 2 (out of 5) and three of them in advanced negotiations towards moving at Stage 3 (“Technology Evaluation at Partner”) or Stage (“Industrial Prototype Tool”) over the coming months and quarters. Among the nine Stage 2 projects, management sees three projects in the most advanced stages and likely to move up the earliest: Open Defect Repair (ODR) for OLED displays Advanced Packaging for semiconductors The European Printed Circuit Board (PCB) project Commercialisation of inks and Delta Printers is developing to schedule and gaining momentum. Besides the above mentioned new Delta Printer sales, the company also sees recurring industrial customers for its nanoinks, which help, at small scale, to drive up the revenue from product sales. For next year, management intends, for the first time, to generate more revenue from the sale of products than from grants, which is in line with our expectations. The partner network of XTPL made its first contribution with the recent signing of the contract with the University of Glasgow, proving the company's distribution strategy right, we believe. China and Korea are developing well as well; however, couldn't establish any tangibles yet, due to the long evaluation processes. Management is confident that especially the UK distribution unit will make further contributions to the pipeline over the next months and quarters. Technology and patent applications are developing further. The company has filed further patents, for example in the field of conductive meshes for small scale OLED display production. Overall, we see continued improvement and step-by-step commercialisation with XTPL and its technology and a management team that executes stringently on its promises and projections. We continue to like the story and see an increased likelihood of future success quarter by quarter.

BN FP,BN,Oct 20 2021 12:27PM,Danone,Food & Beverage,Productivity gains mitigate cost increases while we are waiting for the CMD ,"Danone found back on the profitable growth path in Q3-21 as planned by the company.Now ""broadly based"" pricing and support from efficiency gains should help to meet the broad operating margin guidance (~14%) and low market expectations (13.7% based on last company consensus) e Investors‘ interest, however, lies on strategic changes by the new CEO, which will be presented at the CMD on 08 March 2022. e We slightly adjust our EPS by 1.2%/-0.7%/-1.5% for FY-21-23E e Our price target moves from €69 to €70, and we reiterate our Buy rating. ","Investment case update - a solid quarter showing return to profitable growth. Danone posted 3.8% organic growth (beat vs. 3.6% market expectations) in the third quarter, positively supported by all three categories. Waters saw the highest growth (+4.6%) benefitting from a low base and increasing mobility in Europe, as well as Latin America. Specialized Nutrition grew by (2.9% OG) and EDP continued its growth trajectory (+4.1% OG and MSD for plant-based only). As for all the companies, a primary topic is the input cost inflation. Danone narrowed its earlier estimate of 7-9% COGS impact in H2-21 to 9%, reflecting the mounting cost pressure. At the same time, we notice the more aggressive tone regarding pricing actions (""broad based"" vs. ""selective"" pricing actions before). Additionally, further efficiency gains will play a key role in order to deal with these lasting cost effects. For the second half, Danone expects the efficiency gain effect to exceed the 320bps impact achieved in H1-21. As pressure from the cost side won't vanish for the time being, more efficiency improvements will be necessary in FY-22. We think this quarter’s results can be seen as positive and now more broadly based pricing as well as internal operational measures should help to offset the increasing pressure from costs. We believe this will help Danone to meet the rather low market expectations in terms of operating margin (13.7%). Nevertheless, more decisive will be what the new CEO Antoine de Saint-Affrique has in mind with Danone. A strategic update was announced for the 8th of March 2022. Looking into 2022 (aside from potential strategic changes), we believe EDP can further grow by 3% LFL, while SN will show further recovery in H1 (especially infant nutrition in China), which pushes the category's growth up to 3% for the year. Finally, Waters will further recover (we expect 12% for FY-22), but the development will differ between regions (Europe faster than e.g. Indonesia lagging). On a group level, we expect 4.4% LFL growth in FY-22. Looking at the margin, we think operating leverage, pricing actions, and efficiency improvements will outweigh cost pressure and allow Danone to improve the operating margin to 14.2% (vs. 13.7% FY-21E and 15% Danone target). Changes to our numbers. We take into account the slightly higher (lower) than expected EDP (Waters) growth, as well as the development in Specialized Nutrition. Our organic growth estimates for FY-21 slightly decrease by 10bps to 2.8%. We leave our operating margin assumptions of 13.7% for this year and 14.2% for next year unchanged, as we believe the more rapid efficiency improvements counterbalance higher input cost pressure. Valuation and stock action. Our price target bases on 50% DCF (5.9% WACC, 1.2 beta and 1% LTG) and 50% SOTP, which combined sum up to a new price target of €70 (vs. €69 previously). It looks likely that the next share price catalyst will be a strategic update given in March. As we still stay convinced of the inherent value of Danone and its brands, which should justify a re-rating (currently trading at 13.7 EV/EBIT vs. 18.5x sector and 21.7x Nestlé) once operational improvements kick in, we maintain our Buy rating.",Pascal Boll,Pascal Boll,70,69,Buy,,EUR,3.34,,3.59,,1.83,2.16,,,,,M,STIFEL_Productivity gains_CoNote_Oct 20 2021 12-27PM.pdf,STIFEL_Productivity gains_CoNote_Oct 20 2021 12-27PM,EARNINGS UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=738f167c-ebff-4b7e-849e-14c864cad754&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

Wording from management on short-term supply chain pressure will be important during the 3pm CEST conference call. ","Constant exchange rates (CER) sales growth of 20% was driven by the Americas (+31%) and EMEA (+22%) on tough comps while APAC (+2%) suffered from still challenging trading in China that has not yet recovered from the pre-Xinjiang cotton- related boycott issue.

This strong growth over a two-year stack continues to set Puma above the pack and among the quality names with strong brand heat. 3Q21 GM of 47.4% +40bp (vs SFe: flat, cons. +10bp). Low promotional intensity was partially offset by negative regional mix (Asia and China in particular underperforming Americas) and channel mix (direct-to-consumer underperforming wholesale). e@ 3Q21 EBIT of 12.0%, flat (SFe and consensus 11.3%, -70bp). EBIT margin came in above 3Q19 margin of 11%. Inventories: +12% reported (vs. +8% end-June). We usually like to see low inventories but this rise is reassuring in a context of product shortages (Vietnam disruption). We were looking for 5% organic sales growth in 4Q21. Outlook raised (4Q21 is a small seasonal contributor to earnings): Top line: Management raised its FY21 guidance of ""at least 25% at CER"" from at least 20%. Consensus was already at +29% and this target is undemanding. FY21 EBIT: Management narrowed its previous range to the high end, from €400-500m previously to €450-500m.

MTX GY,MTX,Nov 02 2021 02:00AM,MTU Aero Engines,Aerospace & Defence,Pushing Ahead ,"We reiterate our Buy rating on MTU shares, nudge up our PT to €240 (implying a+26% TSR), and leave EPS estimates unchanged following good Q3-21 Results. e They featured a 4% “EBIT Adjusted” beat vs consensus, mainly driven by OEM segment margins, raised the mid-points of EBIT and Free Cashflow (""FCF"") guidance (which whilst it was still 1% below consensus EBIT, and though well above on FCF, is typically conservative), plus a small FCF beat in the quarter. In our view, it shows the benefit of a richening mix (more aftermarket, both civil and military), partly offset by unusually weak Commercial MRO mix that should reverse. e@ Overall, we see it as a small positive for our thesis that MTU is a revenue and cashflow recovery story, with a favourable bias towards the faster narrow- body and short-haul recovery. The revenue story benefits from the clear indications of strong MRO and Spares demand for Q4-21 and beyond, and the cashflow story from the raised guidance and clear targeting of high-double- digit conversion on average. e@ The share price reaction (up +3% on Friday vs a flat DAX index and a flat Stoxx A&D index) reflects, we believe, comments on a strong MRO outlook as well as the guidance increase, especially for FCF. e YTD, MTU shares are down -11%, vs +15% for the DAX index, and +12% for the Stoxx A&D index. MTU shares trade around the top 4 of European A&D on most trading multiples, and they are high vs its history, but we see this as justified by a projected strong EPS recovery CAGR of 23% (FY-20 to FY-23), benefiting from a depressed FY-20 base, and by low reinvestment needs (and rising cash conversion) going forward. ","Key Positives & Negatives Management generally commented that they had good visibility on Q4-21 and high confidence in the new guidance. All of MTU's Maintenance, Repair & Overhaul (""MRO"") shops ""Are seeing steep workload increases"". MTU expects Q4-21 Spares growth to be in the 30% range, implying ~7% for FY-21. Over the next few years, the CFO has high- double-digit Cash Conversion (i.e. Free Cashflow as a % of Adjusted Net Income) as ""Definitely our target"". Overall, Commercial MRO margin in FY-21 is to be 5% to 6%, despite 4.3% in Q3-21, and MTU sees it in a 5% to 6% range going forward, depending on mix, with a return to the historical level of 8% to 9% not expected ""In the next 1 to years"". Broadly the supply chain is not a big concern, with a dual-sourcing strategy and long-term contracts, although it is becoming a bit more difficult, ""But not for the next couple of years"". Price Target Nudged Up Our new PT is €240 (up 4% vs €230 previously). It is derived from our FY-23 EPS estimate of €10.45 (unchanged vs €10.45 previously), plus a DAX consensus market multiple of 14x (unchanged vs 14x previously), plus a target P/E Relative of 162% (vs 158% previously), which is 0.9 standard deviations above its 10-year mean.

VBK GY,VBK,Nov 04 2021 02:00AM,VERBIO,Oil & Gas,"Q1 Preview: our estimates might not be met in the quarter, but H1 will be a beat ","VERBIO will report Q1 results on 11 November. We expect strong results, albeit stillbelow our estimates due to hedging at high levels. However, this should definitely not jeopardise either the company's guidance, nor our full year estimates, let alone a potential guidance increase later in the fiscal year. More importantly, the continuously strong spreads, especially between grain and ethanol (see below), should provide for a very healthy Q2. That being said, we deem our €87m EBITDA estimate for H1 as rather conservative, despite a potential mid- to high single-digit €m miss on EBITDA in Q1. Besides that, execution on the first phase of VERBIO's investment plan continues and further phases are in preparation. We would use any potential weakness on results day as a buying opportunity. Detailed estimate table overleaf. ","We estimate €49m in EBITDA for the group, 40% from Biodiesel, 60% from Bioethanol, however we now assume a stronger shift towards Bioethanol. Key commodities and end product price development, increase (decrease) vs our last update on 23 September (as of 2 November): Biodiesel: ~10% Bioethanol: ~45% Methane: ~20% Rapeseed oil: ~25% Wheat: ~15% As always, some degree of uncertainty is inherent to VERBIO due to the company's opportunistic approach to trading, hedging and procurement. Nevertheless, VERBIO benefits from the strong momentum in all its end markets, including Biomethane due to increased commodity prices and higher GHG-quota levels. We learned that in cases of strong surges in raw material and product prices, the company tends to hedge its position for a few weeks or months. Given the plateau of biodiesel prices in Q3, hedging seems reasonable and prices only started to spike again since the second half of September. Hence, we see some headwinds to our estimates, especially in the Biodiesel segment. However, looking at the current development, and especially the spread between bioethanol and grain, we believe that Q2 will be an exceptionally strong quarter and beat of our €87m EBITDA estimate is quite possible. Besides these short-term impacts, the story is continuously strong, especially with regard to the announced investment plan and further phases of that plan to come over the next quarters. Furthermore, prolonged high commodity spreads should provide further tailwind for guidance and consensus estimate hikes during H2 FY21/22E.",Florian Pfeilschifter,Florian Pfeilschifter,87,,Buy,,EUR,1.36,,1.97,,0.2,0.2,,,,,M,STIFEL_Q1 Preview-_FlashCoNote_Nov 04 2021 02-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Q1 Preview-_FlashCoNote_Nov 04 2021 02-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=dc9f44b0-a266-4cf0-a070-0f7a14978fb6&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
KWS GY,KWS,Nov 18 2021 04:36AM,KWS Saat,Chemicals,Q1 strong in Cereals and Corn in LatAm ,"In the very seasonal business, Q1 (30 September) is mainly important for the Cerealssegment and the LatAm corn business. In these two business lines, KWS delivered strong sales growth and therefore had a solid start to the new fiscal year. Sales were up by 19% y/y and consolidated (excluding the equity JVs) +20%. EBIT improved by +6% and consolidated by +17%. Q1 always posts a loss due to the seasonal character of the business. All the profit is generated in Q3. Therefore, despite the strong start, KWS is not changing the 2021/22 sales outlook of +5-7% and adj. EBIT margin of 11-12%. ","Cereals has its peak season in Q1 and the strong outcome suggests at this early stage in the fiscal year an earnings increase on the full-year base. EBIT increased y/y from +€36m to +€43m. As indicated at the FY-21/21 results, rape seed was the main driver of growth with a remarkable +56% y/y. After a rather sluggish performance over a number of years just getting back to growth last year, this is welcome news. However, the larger and high margin hybrid rye business has retreated by -5%, as in the environment of high wheat prices, farmers switched acreage from rye to wheat. Therefore, segment sales were up by ""only"" +14% y/y. KWS expects a slightly higher EBIT margin. In combination with the strong sales increase, EBIT might be considerably up on the full-year base, potentially getting close to the 2019/20 level, which would translate to an EBIT increase of >+20% despite continuous increases in R&D expenses. Corn has its main season in Q3 with sowing in Europe and the US. However, KWS is making strong inroads in LatAm, where the season falls mainly in H1. Corn seed sales increased by +52% y/y to €71.1m. The growth is driven by an early start of the season (sales pushed from Q2 in Q1), higher acreage, increased prices and the high acceptance of KWS varieties. However, peers have also reported strong growth with Bayer up in corn seed by +60% and Corteva by +40%. Bayer benefited from a very low base and the y/y increase is distorted. KWS outpaced Corteva, which we take as a sign that KWS continues to gain market share. Assuming the price momentum was c.+20%, volume would be up +30%. We assume that potentially 10-15% of that is explained by the phasing effect between Q1 and Q2. Therefore, Q2 might show no growth at all. The strong increase in sales was not reflected in EBIT, which improved by just +€1m. Production costs are also strongly up, especially in LatAm, which highlights that the earnings upside will be less pronounced than the sales increase might suggest. However, compared with the time of the guidance, exchange rates moved in favour of KWS, which might offer some upside to the cautious guidance. Vegetables was again the weak spot. Sales fell again, as channel inventories are still high. While the market started to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (less outside eating), inventories still don't seem to be back to normal levels. EBIT including PPA was -€4.5m (-€3.3m) and adj. €0.4m (€3.1m). However, for FY-21/22, KWS is confident about delivering much higher sales and earnings, suggesting high ambitions in H2. The Corporate segment posted higher expenses due to the lack of positive FX effects in hedging and company loans.

AMP IM,AMP,Oct 27 2021 08:40AM,Amplifon S.p.A.,Medtech,Q2 in line with expectations ,"Amplifon Q3 results excluding Elite are in line with consensus and our estimates.However, we note that consensus both partly includes and excludes Elite. We have excluded Elite from our Americas estimates and therefore refer to the ","sales numbers ex Elite. Q3 results are in line with sell-side revenue estimates (+0.3% SFe/-0.6% cons) but slightly below on EBITDA (+2.9% SFe/-1.7% cons.). Management confirmed guidance and remains positive for FY-21 as it expects an ongoing positive market trend driven by the effectiveness of the vaccination programme and the easing of restrictions in Australia and New Zealand as this progresses. Recurring EBITDA margin in EMEA improved by 20bps vs Q3-20 and a strong 400bps vs Q3-19, driven by greater efficiency post-COVID, improved profitability in Spain and scale reach in core countries. The Americas' EBITDA margin contracted by 100bps vs Q2-20, but still improved by 150bps vs Q3-19 despite the challenging comparison base and larger investments in the business. The APAC margin contracted by 220bps vs Q2-19 and by a stunning 1,350bps vs Q3-20 due to the strong comp. base driven by social support scheme gains in Australia. The acquisition of Bay Audio will contribute c.EUR 15m to the consolidated revenues for FY-21, which is in line with our expectations.

PHIL IM,PHIL,Nov 15 2021 01:00AM,Philogen S.p.A,Biotechnology,"Q3 2021 update: pipeline development on track, solid net cash position ","Philogen’s Q3 2021 update confirmed that all relevant pipeline projects areprogressing as planned, while its financial position remains strong. For its most advanced pipeline drug, Nidlegy, 187 patients have been recruited into a pivotal phase Ill trial, on track to reach the target of 214 patients by mid-2022E. Furthermore, Philogen’s small-molecule targeting OncoFAP platform is delivering encouraging early-stage results as well. Net cash remains comfortable, with c. €91m in the light of an expected annual cash-burn of c.€20m. We reiterate our BUY recommendation and €26.30 PT on Philogen. ","e@ Solid financial position: At the end of Q3 2021, Philogen’s net cash position declined to €90.9m (reflecting a quarterly cash-burn of c.€5.2m), primarily on account of expenses associated with ordinary operations (c.€-5m). Other factors contributing to the change in net financial position include construction of the Rosia plant (c.€-0.8m), partially offset by cash receipts related to ongoing R&D contracts and positive change in fair value of the securities portfolio. Key clinical programmes on track: Philogen noted that its most advanced clinical programmes are progressing on schedule. In the European phase Ill study on Nidlegy as a treatment for advanced melanoma, 187 patients have been treated, as of November 11, 2021 (target is 214 patients). Philogen confirmed that patient recruitment in the European melanoma study is expected to be completed by mid-2022. Nidlegy is also making progress in melanoma in the US, as well as in a trial on non-melanoma skin cancers in Europe. Fibromun is also advancing along expected timelines in soft tissue sarcoma and brain tumours. The company expects to complete patient recruitment in the European sarcoma study by late-2023. In the first treated recurrent glioblastoma patient (with an un-methylated MGMT promoter, where response to conventional therapy is close to zero), the target glioblastoma lesion disappeared just nine months following treatment commencement with Fibromun. Accordingly, management is upbeat about the prospects of Fibromun in last-line glioblastoma, and accordingly, intends to further explore different administration schedules in a new clinical trial (expected start: 2022), including Fibromun’s use as combination therapy. Additionally, Philogen is witnessing “extremely encouraging” results from the targeted small-molecule OncoFAP platform. The company noted that the fast and selective localisation ability of its radio-labelled targeting agent OncoFAP68Ga had been confirmed in patients with various tumour types. These very encouraging pre-clinical results were recently published in the highly recognized peer- reviewed Journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in the US.

BMW GY,BMW,Nov 03 2021 03:42AM,BMW AG,Automotive,"Q3 at first glance: net income higher, Auto margin lower ","Q3 sales and earnings: Revenue was 5.6% ahead of consensus and 2.2% ahead ofour forecast. The beat versus consensus revenue was driven by Automobiles and a less negative 'Eliminations' line. Group EBIT was 11% ahead of consensus. Within that, Automobiles absolute EBIT of €1.756bn was in line, the EBIT margin of 7.8% slightly below consensus of 8.1%. For comparison: the Mercedes EBIT margin in Q2 was 8.5% (however, this includes the contribution from the China JV), Audi's EBIT margin was 7% (excluding Chinese JVs). Financial Services was 14% ahead of consensus expectations. The positive deviation in group EBIT was partially driven by a more positive 'Others/ Elimination’ line. Net income in Q3 was 22% ahead of consensus expectations, driven by a better contribution from China and a better financial result. ","Automobiles FCF: FCF in Q3 was €1.379bn (consensus: €1.2bn, SFe €1.5bn). That included €403m inflow from working capital. In 9m 2021, FCF was €6.3bn, close to full- year guidance of €6.5bn. However, we understand that Q4 is more likely to see an outflow from working capital and that CAPEX and R&D spending is even more backend loaded than usual. Guidance of €6.5bn still looks realistic rather than overly conservative. Outlook: On 30 September, BMW had already increased the EBIT margin outlook for the Automobiles division from a 7-9% corridor to a 9.5-10.5% corridor and the RoE target for Financial Services from 17-20% to 20-23%. BMW also increased the FCF outlook to ‘around €6.5bn'. Guidance remained unchanged. Conclusion: By end-September, BMW had already increased full-year guidance. Mercedes reported a strong Q3.

VOW3 GY,VOW3,Oct 28 2021 02:22AM,Volkswagen AG,Automotive,Q3 at first glance ,"Q3 results: Revenues came in 3% ahead of consensus and 7% ahead of our forecast. Operatingincome before special items was EUR2.8bn, 13% ahead of consensus and 26% ahead of our forecast. The negative contribution from VW brand was slightly better than what we expected and Audi had a solid quarter with some 7% EBIT margin. The R&D capitalization ratio slightly increased to 45.9% from 43.8% in Q3 2020. ","Outlook: VW reduced the guidance for deliveries from considerably higher to noticeably higher (though this is not quantified). On the other side, revenues for the Group and Passenger Cars / Commercial Vehicles are expected to be significantly higher vs. the previous guidance of ‘considerably higher’, a slight increase in wording. The guidance for the return on sales in the range of 6.0-7.5% is unchanged. The guidance for clean FCF has been reduced from >EUR15bn to around EUR15bn. Traton: Scania's 3Q21 unit sales rose c4% y/y and revenues by c9.6%. Scania EBIT margin came in at 7.7% in 3Q21, which is a significant step-down vs. the c12% shown in 1H21 on volatile production and input price inflation. 3Q21 MAN Commercial Vehicles (i.e. MAN Truck & Bus and VWCO) unit sales grew 13.9% y/y, revenues up 14.7% y/y. 3Q21 EBIT came in at €117m and a margin of 3.7%. The 3Q21 EBIT margin is better than we would have thought initially, pointing to improved pricing and first benefits from restructuring. There is no consensus available. Traton will separately report results at 8:30am. Cash flow and net cash position: the underlying free cash flow before M&A and Diesel was EUR33m, below our forecast of EUR1.2bn and consensus of EUR700m. The deviation is mostly due to a build up of inventory, which should mostly be unfinished products (cars that cannot be delivered to customers due to missing chips). The net cash position declines from EUR35bn in Q2 to EUR25.6bn. This reflects the take-over of Navistar (EUR6bn impact) and the dividend payout. From a SotP valuation perspective, the Navistar effect should be neutral, Traton is included with the market capitalization of the 90% stake that VW owns, Traton's net debt should thus be added back to VW's net cash position. View: A difficult Q3 was largely expected. The confirmation of the margin outlook and the EUR15bn FCF outlook should be neutral. Overall, we think the Q3 results should be neutral.

FRA GY,FRA,Nov 09 2021 02:11AM,Fraport AG,Airlines & Airports,"Q3 a 15% beat on Greece and cost cuts, guidance raised ","Fraport reports Q3 EBITDA at €259m excl. one-offs, i.e., a 15% beat (SFe: €220m, cons.:€227m). FY-21 EBITDA guidance is increased to €650-700m (was: €460-610m, SFe: €701m, cons.: €630m) as traffic recovers more, cost cuts materialise quicker and the Greek business outperforms expectations. We model close to the pre-crisis EBITDA level by next year (~€1.2bn, i.e., ~25% above consensus) on only 75% of pre-crisis traffic as the margin transformation continues to unfold with fee increases and cost cuts. We also see mid-term ","FCF prospects being underestimated. The shares trades on ~15% discount to peers (2023 EV/EBITDA). Q3 numbers: e@ On 45% of 2019 traffic levels in Frankfurt, Fraport reports Q3 EBITDA at €289m. This includes €30m of COVID-19 compensation payments (€23m Greece, €5m Slovenia, €2m US), but the underlying €259m still represents a ~15% beat driven by Greece and cost cuts. (SFe: €220m; cons.: €227m). See also table below. e@ Q3 cost performance was again solid with €106m removed from the Frankfurt cost base vs pre-crisis level (-27% vs 2019). e@ Q3 FCF turned positive to +€121m (SFe: +€50m), a solid improvement (Q2: -€260m, Q1: -€495m). This includes the (previously known) German €160m COVID-19 compensation payment. Capex was in line and stable at €287m (SFe: €275m; Q2: €283m). Excl. growth capex and compensation payments, FCF was +€175m. Net debt is down to €6.2bn (Q2: €6.3bn). Gearing is 166% (Q2: 173%). Available liquidity looks comfortable at €4.5bn (Q2: €4.4bn). Outlook & trends: e@ FY-21 passenger guidance for Frankfurt now at ""upper end of €20-25m"", i.e., ~35% of 2019 (SFe: 36%). Preliminary October figures show recovery has further gained momentum to 53% of pre-crisis traffic (September: 46%). The winter schedule indicates 64% of 2019 seats to be operated by the airlines. FY-21 EBITDA guidance is increased to ""between €650m and slightly above €700m"" (was: €460-610m, SFe: €701m, cons.: €630m). FY-21 FCF is now expected below -€1bn (SFe: -€863m). As before this is driven by €1.1-1.2bn capex (SFe: €1.1bn) and ~€200m compensation payments (staff cuts). e@ On FY-22 fees, Fraport continues to plan for a 4.3% increase. We expect no opposition from the regulator, and it remains our understanding that Lufthansa has accepted the fee increase. Cost cuts: A total of 4.3k employees have signed leave agreements (target was 4k). A total of €500m costs are to be removed this year.

SOLB BB,SOLB,Oct 28 2021 02:15AM,Solvay,Chemicals,Q3 beat and higher FCF guidance ,"Q3 clean EBITDA came in ahead of expectations at EUR 599m (+25% y/y, Stifel: EUR 562m,consensus: EUR 570m) and was again above the 2019 level (+6%). The EBITDA beat came largely from Materials, which was able to increase EBITDA q/q. The flat q/q group EBITDA again defies usual seasonality and therefore confirms ongoing favorable trends, in our view. EBITDA margin even improved +80bps q/q. Solvay reiterated its guidance of EUR 2.2-2.3bn (consensus: EUR 2.27bn) despite the expectation of continued energy, raw mat and logistics headwinds. In 9M-21, the company realised EUR 172m of the EUR 200m of its FY cost-saving target, but had to absorb cost inflation headwinds of EUR 145m in Q3-21 alone. Solvay generated FCF of EUR 692m in 9M-21 after EUR 417m in H1-21. The full-year target is raised to around EUR 800m from EUR 750m. Provisions decreased by EUR 262m YTD, helped by ","a higher discount rate. e@ Carbon neutrality by 2050: Solvay announced an ambitious target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 and raised its 2018-2030 reduction target from -26% to -30%. Apart from fully powering the Germany soda ash plant with renewable energy by 2025, the French site will transition to refuse-derived fuel by 2024, reducing group total emissions by -2%. In this regard, Solvay plans to invest €1bn by 2040 in all its businesses excluding soda ash and an additional €1bn exclusively for soda ash by 2050. Solvay raised its internal carbon price to €100 from €50 per metric tonne of COo. e@ Materials showed ongoing strength. The business seems to have been able to decouple from the weak automotive industry, as EBITDA was up q/q. Composites is slowly starting to recover. Strong demand came from battery applications, which were up by +47% y/y, and double-digit growth in electronics. Solutions showed a better oil & gas end-market, which increased by 68% organically y/y and the solid trend in the other segments allowed increasing earnings sequentially despite intense raw material headwinds. Solvay grouped all oil & gas activities together (previously Novecare and Technology Solutions). e@ Chemicals benefited strongly at Coatis from less US competition after the winter storms in H1. We expected a normalisation in Q3. Silica predominantly delivers to the automotive/tyre industry. The slowdown in the OEM business seems not to have had a material impact, as the business in mainly driven by the replacement business.

We also note the encouraging comments in Brazil, with a gradual improvement seen during the quarter. This performance enables the company to raise its FY EBITDA target, implying a c.2% upgrade at the midpoint. The reinstatement of mid-term targets does not constitute a major surprise although it provides visibility to investors despite the still uncertain environment. Overall, we believe this release should be taken positively, especially given the top-line momentum acceleration. ","Conference call 8.30 am CET.

SPIE FP,SPIE,Nov 05 2021 08:27AM,SPIE,Business Services,Q3 conference call feedback ,"Q3 headwinds should ease into Q4 and the group is building a solid backlogfor 2022. We thus expect an underlying organic growth acceleration in 2022. e We cut our sales and EPS by c.2% on average to account for lower than expected revenue in H2-21. e We stand 45% above consensus on 2021E FCF, implying 6% FCF yield. ","The Q3 slowdown was a one-off and sees underlying improvement in Q4. Mgmt. confirmed during the conference call that the slight slowdown in Q3 was driven by temporary phasing effects (e.g. optic fibre in the Netherlands, or datacenters in the UK), or temporary headwinds (e.g. the recovering but still low demand in aeronautics, or the high comp. base in Germany). Mgmt. expects some of the pressure to ease in Q4, with the start of new contracts in optic fibre, the continued recovery of O&G and an easier comp. base. Strong backlog and order intake for 2022. Mgmt. seemed quite confident on prospects for 2022: it sees strong order-intake in terms of volume and profitability. The Netherlands should benefit from the start of new optic fibre roll-out contracts. Prospects for the two main countries, France and Germany, remain solid. The company is beginning to see the initial impact of the stimulus plans through the ongoing tender offers in energy efficiency (notably in France), in e-mobility (notably fast-charging stations) and new hydrogen- related projects. The company continues to expect +0.5% to +1.5% additional organic growth potential from stimulus plans. Solid margin improvements across the group. In Q3, revenue grew +2.9% q/q, while opex grew +2.4%, driving the seasonal step up in EBITA margin. Nevertheless, the margin came in above expectations. The beat was notably driven by the North-Western region and the UK, which continued to improve sequentially, despite a decline in revenue q/q. The UK notably benefited from the implementation of the restructuring plan and reduction of the cost base. More M&A going forward? The group has acquired €252m pro forma revenue YTD. This compares to the usual €200m target. As the company is now reaching 2.0x leverage, mgmt. seems keen to increase its annual M&A target. The company highlights that it remains disciplined and that transaction multiples remain within the usual range (average transaction multiple: 5.7x EV/EBITDA). Little to no impact from supply chain disruptions and wage inflation. The company is broadly unaffected by supply chain disruptions and shortages and reports only anecdotal incidents. Employee and talent scarcity remains true, but is not significantly different vs. the pre-COVID-19 world. Wage inflation remains in the normal 2-3% range, only very slightly above 2020 inflation level. The group passes inflation onto clients either through indexation clauses or the rapid rotation of its short-term contracts. We cut our revenue and EPS by c.2% to account for lower sales in H2. Nevertheless, we remain above consensus on 2021E EBITA and EPS. We believe consensus sales could be cut slightly, but consensus EBITA is already at a floor level (at the low-end of the guidance). In addition, we still stand 45% above consensus on FCF. The company indicated during the call that the NWC was developing as expected and that the 2.0x leverage target was confirmed for Dec-21. We provide our detailed changes in financial estimates vs. consensus on page 3 (Exhibit 1).",Nicolas Tabor,Nicolas Tabor,24,,Buy,,EUR,1.49,,1.67,,0.6,0.67,,,,,M,STIFEL_Q3 conference_CoNote_Nov 05 2021 08-27AM.pdf,STIFEL_Q3 conference_CoNote_Nov 05 2021 08-27AM,EARNINGS UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=514acd20-9768-44ff-a094-2e9ec79f4dc4&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
SMHN GY,SMHN,Nov 11 2021 02:46AM,Suess MicroTec,SPONSORED RESEARCH Technology Hardware,Q3 EBIT margin increased to 13.9% - FCF remained negative on supply chain issues ,"SMHN reported good Q3 results with the exception being FCF (negative EUR 2m inQ3). Order intake and revenues were already pre-announced last month. New today is the EBIT margin at 13.9% in Q3, up nicely from 10.0% in Q2. Full-year guidance was confirmed, despite supply chain issues that caused saw some slippages of tool shipments into Q4 from Q3. We reiterate our Buy rating as we believe the valuation at 18x P/E 2022E is still quite low compared with other semi equipment companies, and we expect 2022 to be a growth year for SMHN. ","Better-than-expected Q3 margin: Order intake of EUR 101m and sales of EUR 70m were already pre-announced in early Oct. Q3 EBIT margin was at 13.9%, above our forecast of 11.9% as the gross margin increased further to 39.1% from 36.6% in Q2. FCF was again negative EUR -2m as SMHN had to invest in the supply chain. Order backlog at end-Q3 stands at EUR 185m, up 47% Y/Y. Order intake in the Photomask division, the highest margin business, increased 38% Q/Q to EUR 29m. Despite supply chain issues full-year guidance confirmed: SMHN sees sales of EUR 270m to 290m with an EBIT margin of 9% to 11%, FCF in a range of EUR 12m to 18m. Q4 still looks back-end loaded with EUR 90m sales needed to meet the midpoint of the guided revenue range. Also, FCF guidance looks ambitious, given the achievements of EUR 0.2m after 9M. However, the margin recovered in Q3 from the low level in H1. This should ease investors' concern over the sustainability of the margin improvements during 2020, where SMHN reported >10% EBIT margin since Q2. High visibility for growth: The book-to-bill ratio in Q3 stands at 1.35x, providing favourable growth outlook for 2022.

DPW GY,DPW,Nov 04 2021 03:01AM,Deutsche Post DHL,Transportation,Q3 FCF strong; new guidance rather unambitious ,"Deutsche Post DHL's final Q3 EBIT (€1.77bn) is in-line with prelims announced four weeksago (see details here). Q3 FCF came in at a strong €1,257m (prelims: "">€1bn""). Incrementally new today is the guidance lift: EBIT is now expected to be "">€7.7bn"" for FY-21 (Cons.: €7.7bn) and ""€>8.0bn"" for FY-23 (Cons.: €7.9bn). This implies only flat EBIT for Q4 and a more moderate growth trajectory until 2023 than before. FCF guidance is lifted to "">€3.6bn"" for FY-21 (Cons.: €3.4bn) and to ~€10bn cumulative for the FY-21 to FY-23 period (Cons.: €10.4bn). While the normalization post COVID-19 becomes now clearer to see, the underlying investment case is highly attractive, in our view. DHL Express is at the beginning of another multiple year cycle of abnormal volume growth as B2B ecommerce unfolds, and improved cash generation means this year's €1bn share buyback will be more than just a one-time event. We thus stick to our Buy, PT €73. ","Q3 EBIT & FCF largely in line with prelims Final Q3 EBIT at €1.77bn (Cons.: €1.7bn, SFe: €1.6bn) is in line with the preliminary figure reported on 7 October. Q3 FCF however looks strong, now reported at €1,257m vs "">€1bn"" at the prelims (Cons.: €876m, SFe: €900m). As a reminder, the highlights of the Q3 numbers were ongoing German parcel volume growth (+4.6%, despite high comps), forwarding benefit from never-ending freight rate strength and a solid Express showing (albeit volume growth decelerated to +1%). See details here and table below. EBIT guidance now reflects the momentum slowing down post COVID... The expected guidance increase is quantified today as follows: EBIT guidance is lifted to "">€7.7bn"" for FY-21 (was: “>€7bn’; Cons.: €7.7bn, SFe: €7.5bn) and to "">€8.0bn"" for FY-23 (was: “>€7.4bn”; Cons.: €7.9bn; SFe: €7.9bn). This guidance implies almost no EBIT growth in Q4 and rather more moderate EBIT growth until 2023 than before. We believe the company still includes potential efficiency headwinds in Q4 in case volumes do not keep up with ramped up capacities for the peak season, and keeps its conservative approach for 2023 as well. But on a bigger picture the guidance framework does increasingly reflect slowed momentum as markets normalize from the COVID periods. ..while FCF guidance shows cash continues to come through. FCF guidance for FY-21 is increased to "">€3.6bn"" (was "">€3.2bn”; Cons.: €3.4bn; SFe: €3.5bn). The three-year cumulative FCF (for FY-21 to FY-23) the company now guides to ""€10bn"" (was: ~€9bn; Cons.: €10.4bn, SFe: €11.3bn). Investment case remains attractive, stick to Buy. It is clear that earnings growth momentum will come down next years after the last two years were boosted by COVID-19, driving B2C eCommerce (benefiting PeP and Express in particular) and the surge in freight rates (benefiting Forwarding). However, at Deutsche Post DHL there is a story beyond COVID-19, and thus we think the company can maintain the new level of EBIT, and - even more importantly - FCF, and grow it further from here: DHL Express is, in our view, at the beginning of another multiple year cycle of abnormal volume growth once B2B ecommerce unfolds, and the group's structural improved cash conversion means this year's FCF and €1bn share buyback will be more than just a one-time event. We stick to Buy, PT €73.

SIX2 GY,SIX2,Nov 11 2021 09:00AM,Sixt SE,Transportation,Q3 finals — Stronger Europe and business travel ,"Recall that Sixt already released preliminary EBT for Q3 21 (€253m, was a 12% beatover consensus and 5% relative to our numbers) and lifted its outlook substantially on 20 October for pretax profit (€390m-€450m up from €300m-€330m). The upgraded FY 21 outlook was confirmed today. Surpise factors for us were the (1) relative strength of Europe vs. the US. Potentially, the fleet in the US was smaller than we thought. (2) The business travel related business has recovered strongly, not only leisure. (3) Management expects to see higher prices/RPD's in 2022 according to the release. Conference call (webcast) today at 12.30pm CET. ","Q3 Headline KPIs — a bit smaller fleet than we expected: Operating revenue in the third quarter came in at €795.2m which compares with our forecast of €812.7m. The corporate EBITDA for the group in the September quarter came in at €288.3m and thus, better than our estimate (€271m). Q3 group EBT came in at €253.2m, in line with prelims. The average fleet was 120,700 vehicles and compares with our projection of 123,000. In Q3, the figure came to 152,000 (SFe: 159,600). Segment split — stronger Europe: The US exhibited Q3 revenue growth of about 29% over 2019 and acorporate EBITDA of €62.3m, which we expected even stronger. However, both the European segment and the domestic business in Germany were ahead of our expectations (€151.8m and €74.2m, respectively). With regard to the US, management has stated that the ten stations acquired from Advantage Rent A Car has been already contributing substantially. Sixt reported 94 stations in the US (two less q/q). Strong recovery in business, not only leisure: Management speaks of strong demand for mobility that continued into the autumn, particularly in the US and in European markets. Sixt stated that the business travel segment has also shown a clear recovery: global B2B revenues in August and September 2021 were already higher again than the revenue in the same periods in 2019. 2021 outlook reiterated, pricing seen increasing further in 2022: Management confirmed the outlook given on 20 October (Sales of €2.1bn-€2.3bn and an EBT of €390m-€450m (implicit 17.0%-21.4% margin). On 2022, management made the qualitative statement that while it assumes market prices will continue to rise next year, supply risks will have to be monitored.",Adrian Pehl,"Adrian Pehl, CFA",165,,Buy,,EUR,5.65,,6.29,,2.83,3.15,,,,,M,STIFEL_Q3 finals_FlashCoNote_Nov 11 2021 09-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Q3 finals_FlashCoNote_Nov 11 2021 09-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=3baac07b-37a2-424b-8c31-330b47de45be&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
LHA GY,LHA,Nov 03 2021 03:30AM,Lufthansa AG,Airlines & Airports,Q3 first take - FCF & EBIT better; capacity guidance unchanged ,"Lufthansa reports a Q3 EBIT profit of +€17m (SFe: +€3m, cons.: -€33m), i.e. slightlybetter (despite higher than expected restructuring expenses), as Eurowings turned profitable. FCF stands at +€13m (SFe: -€550m, Cons.: -€43m), despite high tax payments and clearly better than our cautious expectations driven by working capital management and capex phasing. Q4 capacity guidance is maintained at 60% of 2019 levels (SFe: 68%), slightly disappointing given bookings are back at 80% of pre-crisis levels, but with a focus on yields. We recently upgraded to Hold, but continue to see multiple strategic/structural mid-term imponderables. ","Q3 numbers: Q3 capacity was at 49% of 2019 levels at the Network Airlines (SFe: 50%) and at 62% at Eurowings (SFe: 65%). e@ Q3 unit revenues were down -22% vs 2019 levels at the Network Airlines (SFe: -20%) and -23% at Eurowings (SFe: -15%). Q3 Adj. EBIT stands at +€17m (SFe: +€3m cons.: -€33m). This includes €255m of restructuring expenses (SFe: €130m). Network Airlines fared a bit worse, Eurowings was better (on leisure recovery). Cargo (on yield strength) again delivered a strong, albeit in-line result (see table below for details). Q3 FCF was +€13m (SFe: -€550m, Cons.: -€43m), despite tax repayment at MRO at -€443m (SFe: -€450m). The reason for the much better performance vs our cautious estimate are a) +€280m from working capital management (SFe: -€100m) as paybale were delayed, b) capex at -€340m (SFe: -€450m), and c) +140m from ""changes in other assets & liabilities/tax"" (relating to the restructuring). Liquidity (pro forma) is down to €8.5bn (was €11bn at the end of Q2), after the capital increase (+€2.1bn) and the repayment/termination of state aid (-€5.5bn). Net debt (pro forma) is now €8.4bn (incl. pensions: €15.6bn), down from €10.4bn (incl. pensions €18bn) at the end of Q2. Outlook & trends: The company retains its 2021 capacity guidance of 40% of 2019 levels; SFe: 44%), with 60% in Q4 (SFe: 68%), despite bookings at 80% of pre-crisis levels. For 2022 the company expects 70% (SFe: 76%) For Q4 the company expects positive EBITDA. FY-21 EBIT loss is to be halved. Out of the targeted cost savings of ~€3.5bn, ca. 70% are implemented (was: 60%). Capex guidance remains at €1.5bn in 2021.

AENA SM,AENA,Oct 29 2021 01:35AM,AENA,Airlines & Airports,Q3 first take: 5% below consensus ,"AENA reports Q3 EBITDA at €496m (SFe: €504m, consensus €520m). 9M FCF wasnegative at -€488m, which remains solid compared with peers given limited capex in Spain. The company still does not give an outlook at this stage. We stick to our Buy rating. We believe AENA is the only airport operator to return quickly to reliable and attractive dividend payments given a strong balance sheet (~2.7x net debt/EBITDA), while >90% exposure to short-haul leisure traffic and low capex mean FCFs should recover quickly. AENA trades on ~10x EV/EBITDA (2023), still ~10% below that of peers. See our more details here. ","Q3 numbers Q3 revenue is €897m, down -33% vs pre-crisis levels on passenger traffic down -42% in Spain. As in the quarters before, the revenue decline was dampened by the minimum guarantee rents (MAGs) which were fully booked as revenue in accordance with IFRS 16 (see below). Q3 EBITDA is €496m, i.e., 2% below our €504m and 5% below consensus, (€520m). e@ 9M OpCF was €20.5m. With group Q3 capex at €508.3m, FCF was accordingly negative at -€488m. Net debt has fallen slightly to €7.5bn (was €7.6bn at end-Q2). Cash stands at a comfortable €2.3bn plus €845m undrawn credit line (unch. vs Q2). Outlook & Trends e@ No profit/traffic guidance provided. AENA says, ""Progress in rolling out vaccination programmes both in Spain and in other countries where passengers come from has led to a rise in passenger demand and an increase in the airlines’ offering mainly since May.""

AF FP,AF,Oct 29 2021 02:11AM,Air France - KLM,Airlines & Airports,Q3 first take: a beat on EBIT and FCF ,"Air France-KLM reports a Q3 EBIT beat at +€132m (SFe: +€26m, cons. -€157m), mainly drivenby a strong result of Transavia and continued strength in cargo. Q3 FCF is also better at + €278m (SFe: -€100m) due to the better EBIT, working capital benefits from forward bookings (transatlantic reopening) and lower capex. The company operated 66% of 2019 capacity in Q3 (SFe: 65%) and plans to operate ~70-75% in Q4 (SFe: 78%). While momentum appears to be quite positive, we remain fundamentally cautious. We continue to argue that the company's equity value is nowhere close to the current share price given the accumulation of net debt through the COVID-19 crisis. In fact net debt has grown to >100% of the entire pre- crisis Enterprise Value of the company, illustrating that there is little/no equity value left for shareholders. Accounting equity remains negative as well (-€3.6bn end-Q3), meaning larger balance sheet restructuring is needed. See more details here. ","Q3 numbers: e@ Q3 EBIT of +€132m is clearly better than consensus (-€157m) and also better than our more optimistic expectation (SFe: +€26m). e@ The beat is driven by Transavia benefiting from the recovery in the short-haul leisure market (EBIT €105m vs SFe: €40m) and the Network airlines (EBIT -€67m vs SFe: -€13m) benefiting from ongoing Cargo strength and a solid late summer business. The company operated 66% of 2019's passenger capacity in Q3 (SFe: 65%). Cargo continued to benefit from tight market capacity, resulting in cargo unit revenue up 3% despite tough y/y comps, resulting in Q3 cargo revenue +24% y/y. FCF for Q3 was +€132m (SFe: -€100m). The better outcome, apart from better EBIT result, seems driven by working capital (+€242m vs SFe: ~-€50m) benefiting from solid bookings (transatlantic reopening) and lower capex (€321m vs SFe: ~€500m). e@ Net debt stands at €8.1bn at end-Q3, or €11.1bn including the hybrid (was €8.3bn at end-Q2). Liquidity stands at €10.4bn (was €9.4bn at end-Q2). The equity shortfall in the balance sheet, as of Q3, has increased to -€3.8bn (was -€3.6bn). We estimate that this will widen further to €6bn by end-2022 (or -€9bn excluding the perpetual). Outlook & trends: The company guides for positive Q4 EBITDA and also slightly positive full-year EBITDA (SFe: €506m). The company plans to operate ~70-75% of normal capacity in Q4 (SFe: 78%). 2022 capacity is unkown at this stage due to the uncertainty around the opening of Asia.

QDT FP,QDT,Dec 08 2021 01:00AM,Quadient,Technology Hardware,"Q3 in line, supply chain risk ahead ","Q3-21 revenue came broadly in line with expectations.e@ The group marginally cut its FY revenue and EBITA guidance due to the supply chain disruptions. e Thus, we trim our FY organic revenue growth estimate by -80bps, and our EPS adj. by -3%. We reiterate our Hold rating and €20 PT. ","Q3 revenue came broadly in line with consensus. Revenue came in at €248m, c.1% above consensus median. Organic growth was flat at -0.3%, in line with consensus. The Mail segment remained resilient, down -1.8% organically y/y. On a two-year stacked basis it improved to -8.0% in Q3, vs. -9.5% in H1. However, the growth segments (software and parcel lockers) posted organic growth c.3-4% below consensus expectations. Nevertheless, the softwares continued to perform well, notably as the group shifts from license sales to SaaS (diluting top-line over the short term). The Parcel Lockers faced a tough comp. base due to the Lowe's contract started in Q3-20. The group cuts its FY revenue and EBITA guidance due to the supply chain disruptions. Organic revenue growth is now expected ‘around 4%' vs. 'above 4%' previously, and v. 5.2% consensus. Thus, EBITA organic growth is now expected ‘around 5-6%' vs. ‘above 6%' previously. The company mentions lower availability of components and shipping delays. Nevertheless, the commercial momentum remains solid despite the delays. The company registered a €5m q/q increase in its next 6-months backlog in Q3-21, which would have implied a c.0.5% additional FY organic growth. We cut our FY organic growth from 5.4% to 4.6%. We now expect organic growth of -3.5% in Q4, implying a q/q deterioration on a two-year stacked view. This is notably due to the supply chain disruption impacts. In addition, the parcel locker segment should decline organically (SFe -29%) due to a very high comp. base from one-off hardware sales last year, and with the pipeline today being mostly rental. In addition, the ICA software segment is progressively shifting to a higher SaaS mix, while Q4 historically benefited from license sales. We cut our FY EBITA by -2.6% and our EPS by c.-3%. The change is notably driven by lower top-line, dropping through to the EBITA. We also note the impact from the higher mix of recurring SaaS and rental vs. one-off hardware and license sales. The ICA software segment and the parcel lockers should have a lower contribution to EBITA margin than in the previous years in Q4. In the parcel lockers segment, the rental model implies an initial investment, followed by a ramp up of the utilization rate before reaching normal levels of profitability. Thus, the diversification towards growth and the shift to more recurring streams of revenue is thus dilutive over the short-term.

FPE3 GY,FPE3,Oct 29 2021 02:05AM,Fuchs Petrolub,Chemicals,Q3 in line — guidance unchanged ,"Guidance confirmed: Fuchs Petrolub confirmed its sales guidance to be at the upperend of €2.7-2.8bn and EBIT of €350-360m. Therefore, implied Q4 EBIT should be €71-81m, which compares with consensus of €80m and Stifel €93m. The company also confirmed FCF guidance of around €110m. Fuchs indicates that the sales growth in 9M is mainly volume driven with pricing becoming more important in Q3. We expect more to come in Q4, which should offset the weakness in volumes due to automotive ","production shortages. However, profitability remains under pressure near-term. The inflection point for EBIT margin might not come before Q1-22. We remain confident of our investment case into 2022 based on earnings momentum driven by an improvement in auto production and progressive price increases. Q3-21 in line: Fuchs reported Q3-21 EBIT of €88m, exactly in line with consensus. While volumes came under pressure due to the ongoing chip shortage in the automotive industry, Fuchs was able to raise prices on the back of strong raw material headwinds. As a result sales were flat q/q and there was a slight decline in EBIT margin sequentially (-35bps). Regionally, EMEA was the most impacted on profitability with a margin decline of -130bps q/q while the other regions held up well. FCF reflects the higher NWC and declined significantly over 9M-21 to €44m (-64%). Driven by higher volume and even more by higher prices, NWC increased by +28% y/y and even +9% q/q. It is the third quarter of disproportional increase of NWC and NWC/ sales increased to 23.7%. Higher tax payment came on top. As promised, capex came down significantly and was only half the level of last year with just €45m in 9M-21. Despite the low outcome after 9M, Fuchs reiterates its FCF guidance of €110m for FY-21.

ERF FP,ERF,Oct 21 2021 02:12AM,Eurofins,Business Services,Q3 not as strong as could have been expected ,"Eurofins published Q3 revenue of €1,630m, 3% above consensus expectations.Organic growth stood at 11.7% vs. 10.1% consensus. Core organic growth was 9.0% (or 10% on a two-year stacked view), thus decelerating again q/q. COVID-19 testing revenue came in below our expectations and 6% below the Q2 level due toa negative mix effect, which should have also put pressure on margins. The revised FY-21 revenue guidance remains below current consensus and the EBITDA and FCFF guidance are unchanged. We therefore expect little changes to current ","consensus. Core organic growth came in at 9% in Q3, or 10% ona 2-year stacked view (adjusted for the 2019 cyber-attack impact). This performance remains solid as it implies ERF caught up on its 5% Core organic growth CAGR in 2021. The company states that it ""continues to see strong demand across its markets for the remainder of the year and in the mid-term"". However, the sequential slow down q/q could raise questions from investors in our view, especially as the comp base tightens over the coming quarters. COVID-19 testing revenue came in at €322m, down -6% q/q, driven by higher volumes in the US and in France, but offset by a negative mix effect as the proportion of lower priced antigen tests was greater. The group thus generated €1,050m revenue over 9M from COVID-19 testing, while it was expecting to generate €1.0bn over FY-21 (as of H1 results). The group now guides for €1.2bn over FY-21, implying €150m in Q4-21, declining by c.-50% q/q. This seems a conservative scenario to us, broadly in line with the implied scenario from Synlab's recently revised guidance (SYAB GY, Hold, €21.05). e@ FY-21 guidance: ERF now guides for €6,350m revenue, up from €6,150m previously, yet still below current consensus of €6,406m. Due to uncertainties linked to COVID-19 testing, the adj. EBITDA guidance remains unchanged at €1,700m (vs. €1,800m consensus). Little revisions expected to consensus: The revised FY-21 revenue guidance remains below current consensus, and the EBITDA and FCFF guidance are unchanged.

EBIT margin wasin line with consensus expectations. The outlook is left unchanged and we see implied Q4 performance achievable. A strategy update will be presented before the end of the year. Overall we have a mixed view on the print, with E&l still dragging the group's performance with few signs of improvement, although we do not expect any particular consensus moves following the release. No conference call scheduled. ","Q3 revenue — Organic growth below expectations: (1) Organic growth of +1.9% y/ y, below consensus of +3.9% y/y (SFe +4.5% y/y). It implies 2yr stack organic growth of -6.5%, improving vs. Q2 (c.-10%); (2) Adj. EBIT of €47m (+14% y/y), in line with consensus of €46m (SFe €48m). Adj. EBIT margin was flat y/y at 10%, in line with consensus (SFe 10.4%). Margin stood 110bp below that of Q3-19; (3) FCF of €11m during the quarter vs. €82m Q3-20 (€51m Q3-19), impacted by working capital outflow. Divisional review — E&l, IDIADA and Labs below our expectations: (1) Energy Industry: Q3 organic growth +3.4% y/y, below our expectations (SFe +7% y/y). Organic revenue still 9% below 2019, though improving vs. Q2 (-15%). Oil & gas was stable y/y during the quarter, reflecting growth in opex and continued decline in capex; (2) Automotive: Q3 organic growth -4.5% y/y, broadly in line with our expectations of -5% y/y. This implies 2yr stack organic growth of +2%, in line vs. Q2 (+2%); (3) IDIADA: Q3 organic growth +8.3% y/y, below our expectations (SFe +11% y/y.) This implies 2yr stack organic growth of -7%, in line vs. Q2 ; (4) Laboratories: Q3 organic growth +1.9% y/y, below our expectations (SFe +9% y/y). Organic revenue still 5% below that of 2019 vs. -6% Q2. The division was notably impacted during the quarter by supply chain disruption due to the shortage of semi-conductors. FY21 outlook unchanged: The company continues to look for mid-teen revenue growth ex FX (broadly in line with consensus / SFe) and adj. EBIT margin close to 10% (consensus 10.1%).

BVI FP,BVI,Oct 27 2021 01:00AM,Bureau Veritas,Business Services,Q3 positive - FY21 outlook unchanged ,"Q3 showed solid organic growth (+7.5% y/y), slightly above consensus (c.+6% y/y),and in line with our estimates (buy-side likely closer to us). The underlying trends continue to be well-oriented across the key segments, which should continue to deliver a solid performance over the coming quarters. The FY21 outlook has been confirmed as expected; however, this implies that there should not be upward revisions to consensus this quarter, for the first time this year. We thus do not expect this release to be a particular trigger for the shares, with all eyes on the upcoming CMD (3 December) where we expect to have an update on the mid-term outlook. ","Q3 organic growth slightly above consensus: organic growth of +7.5% y/y during the quarter, slightly above company-compiled consensus of +6.2% (SFe +7.4%). It implies 2-year stacked organic growth of +3.5%, broadly in-line with Q2. We would particularly flag the positive performance in Marine & Offshore, Agri-food & commodities, Industry and Certification. On the other hand, Consumer products was broadly in line with our expectations, while Building & Infrastructure was below (although still showing a good performance). e@ FY21 outlook confirmed, as expected: FY21 targets are left unchanged with ‘strong’ organic growth, adj. operating margin improvement and 'strong' FCF. Consensus currently expect 9.5% organic growth y/y (SFe +10% y/y), implying Q4 organic growth of c.+3% y/y, or c.+1% vs. 2019 (SFe c.+3%). Expectations point to 16.1% margin (SFe in line, c.+280bp y/y and c.20bp below 2019), with H2 margins seen broadly flat y/y at 16.6% (c.60bp below H2-19). Q4-21 to face some phasing effect: underlying trends should remain solid in Q4 although the company flagged two segments with phasing effects. The Certification segment won't benefit any longer from the positive impact of the recertification on ISO schemes (c.1/3 of the portfolio) and it should be a low seasonal quarter for M&O (Marine & Offshore). Nevertheless, we think this seems to be well understood by the market considering the current FY21 consensus. Consumer Products - Reassuring comments: as expected, volumes did not recover to 2019 levels in Q3 (c.-2.5% organically) due to lockdowns in Southeast Asia. Conversely, the momentum has been very positive in China (benefiting, to some extent, from production moving back from Southeast Asian countries under lockdown). Beyond the lockdown effect, the shipping issues looks to have a minor impact on BVI's activities, while chip shortages have no impact, according to management. Marine & Offshore - Positive outlook: management's comments were quite positive with the Q3 order book up 13% YTD, which bodes well for next year. The market is growing and the company is recording some ‘good wins', coupled with good pricing power. Certification - Positive outlook: mid-single digit underlying growth pace seen over the coming quarters, notably driven by an acceleration on second-party audit which will benefit from the ESG tailwinds, in our view. Cost Inflation - no impact seen: wage inflation does not constitute an issue at the group level. Management proactively raised prices starting in Q1-21, allowing the company to protect margins. Pricing is seen to have less than 2% contribution to group organic growth, including a mid-single price increase in North America.",Nicolas Tabor,"Nicolas Tabor;Simon Lechipre, CFA",31.5,,Buy,,EUR,0.97,,1.05,,0.49,0.52,,,,,M,STIFEL_Q3 positive_FlashCoNote_Oct 27 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Q3 positive_FlashCoNote_Oct 27 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=f7972cbc-601d-49dc-a752-85b9673176a8&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
STMN SW,STMN,Oct 25 2021 01:00AM,Straumann,Medtech,Q3 preview: Smile for DD Growth & ESG ,"We expect Q3 to be another strong quarter, with double-digit growthrates, driven by a continuously friendly market environment and favourable competitive dynamics. e@ We raise or PT to CHF 1,820, but reiterate our Hold rating. e With this update we include our ESG framework for Straumann. ","Strong momentum is continuing into Q3 In our last note we were cautious on H2-21, due to a potential spending shift towards travel and leisure. Going into Q3-21 we became more constructive as patient flow remains on a healthy level with a limited impact from shifts in consumer patterns. Therefore, we further upgrade our FY-21 organic revenue growth estimate for Straumann to 35.1% (from 32.6%). For Q3-21, we expect 25.6% organic growth, driven by the following trends: EMEA: The pull out of Implant Direct from the value segment is still positively impacting the placing of Medentika and Anthogyr in the European market. In our last note we estimated that Implant Direct had a 5% market share in EMEA. The TLX launch is largely focusing on EMEA, but is not a meaningful contributor to Q3-21 sales, yet. We expect a more noticeable impact around Q1-22. Dr. Smile is still performing above expectations and is successfully expanding into the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden. We estimate 25.5% organic growth for Q3-21. Furthermore, we model 5.0% acquisition effect in Q3-21 from Dr. Smile. NA: We expect a persistent supportive market environment in North America coupled with ongoing market share gains, driven by the lack of a competitive answer to the premium BLX implant. In our view, the announcement of Dentsply's DS PrimeTaper will increase competition, but should not take substantial market share from Straumann. We also expect further market share gains in the DSO channel, driven by the strong offering of NeoDent. We model 25.3% organic growth for the region. APAC: Straumann is not directly impacted by a possible collapse of Evergande. However, indirectly a change in wealth distribution could become a risk factor longer- term. Clear Aligner approvals in China are now expected in Q4-21. However, China still remains a strong growth distributor. Japan is estimated to show slightly lower revenue than initially expected due to the pandemic. We set our organic growth estimate to 25.0%. Latin America: We forecast another quarter where the company benefits from its superior supply chain and strong offering of NeoDent in Brazil. We set our organic growth estimate to 29.5%, taking the weak comparison base into account. CORE EBIT Margin is normalising We are cutting our FY-21 CORE EBIT margin by 160 bps to 28.0%. This is primarily driven by the materially lower-than-expected H1-21 CORE EBIT margin. However, we still expect to see the return of OPEX in H2-21.

We expect a furthercontinuation of the strong execution we saw in H71. In particular, a pick-up in the Service business with the increasing availability of Covid-19 vaccines is beneficial, in our view. We see some headwinds coming from logistics costs and increased material prices. However, we are confident that the increased utilisation of the rental fleet as well as general operational leverage are capable of offsetting that development at least partly. We continue to believe that the stock needs strong, and at best, quantitative impulses from the company on growth and development beyond 2021 in order to leave its sideways-trajectory. Detailed estimate are in table overleaf. ","We estimate €25.5m revenue, €5.2m EBITDA and €1.7m EBIT in Q3. We model strong YoY pick-ups in Systems and Services with 70% and 62% growth, respectively; however, the latter might be a bit aggressive, given the still rather retained clinical trials business.. e@ Products, on the other hand, is rather flattish at strong levels in Q3, by our forecast. e@ We expect the company to confirm the upper end of its current guidance that is in line with our and consensus expectations for 2021E. We also believe that the company will reiterate its view that there will be ongoing strong growth going forward. Nevertheless, we don't expect a quantitative outlook for 2022E as of now or any mid-term targets; hence, the stock might continue to trade sideways for the time being.

M5Z GY,M5Z,Nov 03 2021 02:03AM,Manz,SPONSORED RESEARCH Capital Goods,"Q3 Preview: Muted quarter, but CMD might point towards a more exciting 2022 ","Without major events in Q3, we believe that Manz core headwind topics (Solar,Electronics restructuring) will dominate results due Tuesday next week (9 November). Besides overall rather muted newsflow around the company, we are not aware of any major projects to be concluded between July and September, hence overall momentum seems to be rather low. Nevertheless, we see any weakness after the publication as a buying opportunity into any EV-related deal announcements after the reporting day. Detailed estimates preview overleaf. ","e@ Despite termination of the Solar contract, we believe this will take some time to conclude. Hence, negotiation and headcount continue to weigh on Manz's P&L, especially before larger EV orders come in. We expect further colour on the termination, but not P&L tailwinds. Electronics is still under restructuring in Asia and shouldn't contribute significantly to profitable growth yet. Besides Solar, we see the Electronics segment as the biggest source of financial headwinds in Q3 results. Energy Storage should continue to contribute positively to results, in our view. However, given the delayed ramp-up in the TWS battery space, this might fall short of initial expectations. We don't expect big announcements for EV-related order intake before or on results day and therefore see lower levels as good entry points to focus these orders into the second half of Q4 and Q1 next year. e@ We don't see particular events in either Contract Manufacturing or Service; however, the former could see a delayed project ramp-up, especially from Asia, given the still tight COVID-19 situation, particularly in China. e@ Manz will hold a CMD on its reporting day as well and will showcase some production lines at its customers site in Tubingen. We do not expect order announcements during the event, but do anticipate a little more colour on how the European battery space and the environment for Manz is developing.

VAR1 GY,VAR1,Nov 04 2021 02:00AM,VARTA AG,Technology Hardware,Q3 Preview: AirPods 3 delay and battery type should weigh on top and bottom line ,"VARTA has collected consensus data from its covering analysts prior to the Q3results, due next Thursday, 11 November. Consensus data for adj. EBITDA for 2021E decreased by 2.7%, for 2022E it decreased by 5.7% and for 2023E by 6.9% compared with consensus collected before the Q2 results (data collected from nine analysts). Our estimates are significantly ahead of consensus as we believed in an earlier ramp-up in the CoinPower business for AirPods 3 and an overall stronger Q3 than Q4, which might shift now. What makes us bearish on Q3 results not only regarding our estimates, but also in view of consensus is the overall delay in AirPods 3, the old battery generation and the limited physical ramp-up in the new plant. In addition, we note the ongoing strong expectation of a guidance raise, especially among retail investors, which we don't share, especially not after the AirPods 3 delay. The below-consensus results and a skipped guidance raise are the main triggers in the Q3 reporting day, in our view. On the EV side, we don't expect further material information on the 21700 battery or new customers. Comparison table overleaf. ","e@ We are 21% ahead of consensus adj. EBITDA estimates, as we believed in an earlier ramp-up of production capacity and overal AirPods 3 production in the CoinPower business. Furthermore, our assumption included the new A4 battery cell to be included in the AirPods 3, which should bear a higher price and margin profile; we think the latter is still underestimated by consensus. The second-biggest headwind besides the miss on consensus we expect into the results is a delay in increasing the guidance, in our view. We note that German retail investors in particular appear to be holding out for a guidance raise, for which we don't see any evidence. Given the delayed launch of AirPods 3 and provided battery, we believe management won't be able to raise guidance in 2021E at all. In addition, news sites and channel checks from Asia suggest that Samsung SDI is eligible for Apple products soon, EVE Energy is shipping first samples to Apple and LG Energy Solutions already announced plans to supply Apple with coin cells going forward. We think it is likely that VARTA will provide an outlook into 2022E, which we argue should lead to consensus downward corrections, similar to last year. On the 21700 battery and its commercialisation, we don't expect major announcements, especially after the limited incremental insights and news from its CMD in early October.

SPIE FP,SPIE,Nov 05 2021 03:45AM,SPIE,Business Services,Q3 results: higher margin offsets slower organic growth ,"Q3 revenue came in at -3.4% below consensus expectations, notably due toFrance and North Western Europe. The market may be worried by the sequential slowdown. Nevertheless, the underlying trends remain well oriented and the group reiterated its 2021 revenue guidance. On the bright side, Q3 EBITA came in +4.1% above consensus at €110m, implying a 6.4% margin (50bps above cons.). The company has thus raised its 2021 EBITA margin guidance from 6.0% to 6.1%. The company also expects further margin expansion in 2022. We believe the Q3 trends highlight the group's selective profitable growth, focusing on the bottom line and cashflow over volume. Overall, we expect consensus to cut its FY-21 revenue estimate by c.-1% but EBITA and EPS to remain stable. In our view, investors should not focus on short-term noise at the top line as we see SPIE as a solid and attractive FCF story, currently trading on a 7%/9% FCF yield 2021/22E. ","Upgraded margin outlook: After a 4% beat in Q3, SPIE now targets a 6.1% EBITA margin in 2021 (up from 6.0%) and sees ""a clear potential for Group margin to increase further in 2022"". We understand mgmt. is targeting a 6.5% margin over the mid-term (the historical peak level and at the very high end of competitors’ profitability range). The improvement in Q3 was notably driven by improvement in the lower margin regions (North Western and Central Europe) towards the high levels of France and Germany. Rest of FY-21 outlook confirmed: SPIE reiterated its guidance for 2021 revenue at or above the 2019 level in absolute terms (consensus is 2.4% above). While overall top-line guidance is unchanged, the bolt-on M&A guidance has been revised upward from €200m to €250m of pro forma revenue acquired at the end of the year. The additional scope effect should mostly impact Q4, thus we expect a limited +0.1% incremental scope effect in FY-21. Finally, leverage is expected at 2.0x, in line with consensus. Sequential organic slowdown: We estimate that, on a two-year stacked basis, organic growth has decelerated. The sequence reported by SPIE (based on 2019 restated figures) was +1.1% in Q1, then in line in H1. Based on our non-restated estimates, the two-year stacked organic growth sequence was +1.2%/-1.3%/-3.3% in Q1/Q2/Q3. North Western Europe (21% of sales / 15% of EBITA) continued to weigh: The region posted a -10% organic decline in Q3, implying continued significant deterioration q/q on a two-year stacked view. The region was notably impacted by a sharp decrease in datacentre activity y/y in the UK and the phase out of some optic fibre rollout contracts in the Netherlands. France also came in below expectations with +1.4% organic growth, vs. +3.5% SFe and +4.1% Visible Alpha consensus. Due to the weight of the region (36% of sales / 35% of EBITA), this deviation explains a significant part of the top-line miss. The company mentions encouraging dynamics on the country and only flags as negative that activity in aeronautics remained under pressure. e@ Conference call at 9:00am CET: +44 33 0551 0200 / SPIE Exhibit 1 - Miss on production, beat on EBITA Q3-21 9M-21 aeAG | CRep.

MOR GY,MOR,Nov 11 2021 02:01AM,MorphoSys AG,Biotechnology,"Q3 results with no major surprises, upcoming pipeline data in focus ","Last night, MorphoSys announced its full Q3 2021 results, after having already pre-announced Monjuvi US sales earlier this month. We note that royalties associated with ex-US sales of Minjuvi, albeit negligible currently, have also started trickling in. The company’s operating loss was narrower than our estimates and its cash and investments balance remains solid (>€1bn). FY 2021E guidance was retained. Management will conduct a conference call today at 2:00pm CET. Despite a disappointing share price performance ytd, we are of the view that MorphoSys’s pipeline continues to buzz and may deliver incremental positives in the coming weeks. Recently, the first patient was dosed in the Phase Il IGNAZ study on felzartamab as a treatment for Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy (IgAN), and separately, encouraging interim results were presented on the same candidate as a potential treatment for membranous nephropathy (M-PLACE study). Near-term catalysts for MorphoSys include upcoming data presentations on tafasitamab and pelabresib at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) meeting next month (December 11 to 14), where ten abstracts will be presented. We reiterate our BUY recommendation and €64.00 PT on MorphoSys. ","Q3 2021 results: Revenue came in at €41.2m (+87% y/y), about 4% below Stifel estimates but nearly 3% above company-provided Vara consensus. Revenue growth was aided primarily by the pre-announced US product sales of Monjuvi (€18.6m vs. €4.4m in 3Q 2020) but also supported by strong contribution from Royalties (€17.0m; +67% y/y), which included first-time contribution of €82k from ex-US sales of Minjuvi. We note that the one-time receipt from Royalty Pharma has been routed through the Cash Flow statement in the company’s report. R&D expenses rose to €-64.4m (+88%), but was lower than Stifel (€-76.0m) as well as consensus numbers. Similarly, although the group operating loss widened to €-82.4m (+33% y/y), it was still significantly better than both our and consensus view. Net loss widened to €-112.8m (+73% y/y). At the end of 3Q 2021, the company’s cash and investments (previously referred to as liquidity) stood at €1,131m (Stifel estimate: €919m). FY 2021 guidance confirmed: MorphoSys reiterated its FY 2021 guidance, as updated in July 2021, calling for revenue of €155m to 180m (Stifel estimate: €159.5m), operating expenses (excluding €-36m in one-time transaction costs) of €-435m to €-465m (Stifel estimate: €-462.9m), and R&D expenses as a proportion of OpEx (including the one-time transaction costs) of 52-57% (Stifel estimate: 53.4%).

On the portfolio development, we note a slightly better pace of openings in Q3. On the other hand, we note the decline in the pipeline, with a slowing pace of signings driven by Greater China and the EMEAA region.

ADP FP,ADP,Oct 22 2021 02:20AM,Aéroports de Paris,Airlines & Airports,"Q3 sales — marginally better, guidance confirmed ","Aéroports de Paris reports Q3 sales at €879m (SFe: €836m; Cons.: €846m), i.e.some 4% above consensus. The 2021 outlook is intact, with 30-40% of the 2019 traffic level still expected in Paris (SFe: 39%) and EBITDA margin at 15-20% (SFe: 17%). Our main concerns on ADP remain: leverage is rising to rather uncomfortable levels by FY-22 (SFe: net debt/EBITDA ~7x) and, consequently, we assume a cut in the pay-out policy to 30% of net profits (from 60%) once dividend payments resume. Furthermore, the company trades on 13.5x EV/EBITDA, vs. its historical average of 9-11x and peers at ~11x. See our last note here. ","Q3 sales: Q3 revenues came in at €879m (SFe: €836m; Cons.: €846m), which is a 75% y/y increase and ~4% above expectations. Compared to 2019 levels it is a decline of -34% with Q3 passenger numbers in Paris 49% lower. 9 month retail sales per pax increased by 13% y/y and 11% vs 2019, which we contribute to the fact that only parts of the terminals have been operational. These are the most attractive from a retail point of view. The main reason for Q3 sales being slightly above expectations is the international segment (mainly TAV and AIG), which continues to recover quicker than the Parisian operations. Here Q3 revenues stand at €267m, up 145% y/y. This is 14% above our estimate and ~77% of 2019 levels. As usual, no profits reported for Q3. Outlook/Trends e@ The company confirms the full traffic guidance at 30-40% of 2019 levels this year in Paris (SFe: 39%). The ytd performance stands at 32% of 2019 levels. No full-year profit guidance provided, but the EBITDA margin is still expected at 15-20% (SFe: 17%). e@ Capex in Paris for 2021 and 2022 is still expected to be €500-550m p.a. (SFe: ~ €500m).

EMSN SW,EMSN,Oct 28 2021 01:18AM,EMS-CHEMIE,Chemicals,Q3 sales slightly below expectations ,"EMS Q3 revenue of CHF 526m falls slightly short of expectations (+16.6% y/y,Stifel: CHF 537m, consensus: CHF 536m) but is still above the pre-pandemic level. Organic growth was +15% y/y and FX shows a small tailwind of 1.5%. Based on 60% automotive exposure, the global car production trend (-20% y/y in Q3) translates to -12% lower sales. In this context, the sales progression is still a solid outcome. The (unspecific) guidance of y/y higher sales and EBIT was reiterated. However, the company highlights that it expects a weakening economy in the coming months due to supply bottlenecks and cost increases hampering demand. EMS mentioned it is prepared to take appropriate actions if necessary. We see these comments as a sign of q/q falling sales in Q4. In Q3, sales were already down by -12% q/q. ","The organic sales y/y increase was stronger in the small segment, Specialty Chemicals (+24.3%), than in the main segment, High Performance Polymers (+14% y/y). However, Specialty Chemicals is more dependent on the automotive industry and therefore shows more pronounced swings, which has become evident again with the -16% q/q decline compared with -12% at High Performance Polymers.

BAYN GY,BAYN,Oct 25 2021 12:03PM,Bayer,Pharmaceuticals,Q3 should show CropScience as positive driver ,2021 sales guidance might be increasede CropScience should make strong progress as of Q3 e Focus at Pharma on momentum of new products @ We keep our PT of EUR 66 unchanged and reiterate our Buy rating. ,"Q3 EBITDA expected to be c. EUR 2.1bn (+15% y/y, +4% to consensus). The driver is CropScience, which should recover strongly from the trough in Q3-20. Management outlined already that the phasing of seed earnings favors this year H2 in y/y comparison. The negative margin impact from higher costs (350bps in Q2) should start to be offset by higher prices for the LatAm season. Crop protections showed 15% growth in herbicides in H1, which was largely driven by higher glyphosate prices. The price momentum even accelerated in Q3 and should move sales and earnings up. On this basis, we expect CropScience to deliver c. EUR 450m EBITDA in Q3, which is still below the Q3-19 level of EUR 527m, mainly explained by FX, in our view. Rising marketing efforts for Nubeqa and Kerendia translate in a falling margin at Pharma, as already indicated by the company. The Market will focus on the sales progression of the new products, which should drive sales of undisclosed sales up (below top 15 products), which we expect to increase by c. +10% q/q. Sales guidance with potential upside risk. At CropScience, Bayer's guidance is based on 7% organic growth y/y and 23% EBITDA margin (24% excluding fx). H1 growth was +8% and we expect +16% in Q3 and +12% in Q4. H2 is driven by double-digit price increase in seed in LatAm and substantially higher glyphosate prices. We therefore see upside to the CropScience sales guidance, but see the margin guidance still as valid. Pharma should grow by 6% organically, according to the guidance. Our forecast is close to +9%, which would also leave some upside. The margin decline is driven by higher R&D and marketing expense and might not change with higher sales, as more resources could be used for higher marketing spent. Our sales forecast of EUR 43.6bn is ahead of the guidance of EUR 43bn. Our group EBITDA margin assumption is 25.6% compared to company guidance of 25%. The slightly higher sales and margin assumptions translates to acore EPS forecast of EUR 6.44, which is above the guidance range of EUR 6.00-6.20 (consensus: EUR 6. 3). Litigation becoming visible in the cash flow. We do not expect an update on the c. 30,000 inventory cases, but assume Bayer to provide more details on the cash outflow in 2021, which the company expects to be EUR 7bn. Low valuation after a series of disappointments, but trust could gradually come back: Bayer outlined that it takes long until CropScience can benefit from the improved agro environment, as prices can only increase once a year and any move is only moderate, but increased prices are sticky. We expect the improving price trend to become visible starting with Q3. Step by step better reporting at CropScience should bring more confidence in the mid-term targets. Still, prospects in Pharma after the patent expires for Xarelto and Eylea are seen with concerns. The progress in revenues of Nubeqa and Kerendia, where we expect the reporting of quarterly sales figures to start next year, should also help to improve the sentiment towards the stock.",Andreas Heine,Andreas Heine;Isha Sharma,66,,Buy,,EUR,6.44,,6.94,,2,2.1,,,,,M,STIFEL_Q3 should_CoNote_Oct 25 2021 12-03PM.pdf,STIFEL_Q3 should_CoNote_Oct 25 2021 12-03PM,EARNINGS UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=8ad88c46-945d-4071-b631-b0873f4544f2&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

The company now expects the headwinds from raw material and energy costs to be >€400m, compared with >€300m a month ago and >€200m at the beginning of the year. e@ Silicones saw double-digit growth in specialties: EBITDA was sequentially +20% higher against the usual seasonal trend. Demand is strong and rising prices continue to more than offset cost inflation. The EBITDA margin continues to be >20% at 23.6%. Guidance is unchanged as Q4 will be affected by a force majeure (NUnchritz) and planned maintenance (China). Polymers surprised with strong earnings increase: Temporary surcharges and underlying price increases worked hand in hand and lifted EBITDA sequentially, which was on par with that of last year. Guidance was raised to €1.6bn sales and 16% margins, i.e., €256m (consensus: €213m) Polysilicon represents >45% of Q3-21 group EBITDA. The company updated guidance on the back of considerable price increases to sales of €1.5bn (+90%) and EBITDA margin >40% (before >+50% and >30% respectively), which translates to at least €600m EBITDA for FY-21. On the back of this forecast, Q4 EBITDA would be on a par with Q3's. The company highlights its market share of nearly 50% for computer chips. Biosolutions progressing: Sales showed good q/q momentum, even without the Curevac contract. The EBITDA margin is 15%. Others expenses were -€24m, but fluctuate strongly quarter by quarter (Q1: +€18m, Q2: -€19m). Net cash: The strong cash generation is reflected in the increase of the net cash position. The cash pile increased to €538m after Q3-21.

STMN SW,STMN,Oct 28 2021 02:07AM,Straumann,Medtech,Q3 strong beat and guidance raise ,"STMN posted very strong Q3 sales this morning, which are 4.9% ahead of ourestimate and an 8.3% beat to V.A. consensus on group level. Organic revenue growth reached 31.6% (SFe: 25.6%; cons.: 21.8%), despite a stronger comparison base. Management raised again its FY21 outlook for organic revenue growth to ""in the high-thirties"" (before: ""above thirty percent""; SFe: 35.1%; cons.: 37.5%) and CORE EBIT margin to ""at least at the 2019 level"" (before: ""nearly reaching the 2019 level""), which was 27.1% (2021 SFe: 28.0%; 2021 cons.: 27.3%). The new guidance implies a noticeable slowdown in Q4 and hence appears conservative, in our view. ","Growth in all regions exceed our estimates and consensus, with a particularly strong performance in EMEA (32.1% organic growth) and LatAm 62.5% organic growth). Growth: Straumann has fully launched the TLX implant in September. In addition, the company has entered into a partnership with Aspen Dental Management, a leading DSO in the U.S. Investments: Straumann acquired a 39% stake in mininavident to enhance its platform for guided surgery. In addition, the company intends to invest about CHF 18m ina new technology and innovation centre in Basel. The company will present its Q3 results at 10.30am CET.

NXI FP,NXI,Oct 27 2021 01:00AM,Nexity,Construction,"Q3 trading update broadly in line, with an uptick in building permits. ","Nexity reported Q3-21 revenue of €1,013m (at the low-end of the consensus range).Q3 revenue was thus up +12% y/y mainly driven by Residential Development. We note that Nexity reported a pick-up in new building permits obtained, but the management's tone remained prudent during the conference call. Thus, the group reiterated its pro forma FY-21 guidance of €4.4bn revenue (vs. €4.5bn consensus) and > €360m current EBIT (vs. €364m consensus). We therefore expect limited upward revisions to FY-21 consensus for now. We believe the main focus from now on should be on the magnitude of the building permits recovery over the following months, and the potential upside on 2022 estimates. Current consensus stands at €4.8bn in 2022E implying a 6%/9% y/y growth vs. 2021 guidance/consensus. ","Reservations on track: NXI signed 4,092 new home reservations in Q3, down -2.2% y/y. Over 9M, new home reservations are down -3.3% y/y. The company thus seems well on track to meet its reiterated guidance c.20,000 reservations in 2021, implying c.-5.5% decline y/y (vs. consensus of -2.5% y/y). Upside could come from the recently obtained building permits, though management's tone remained prudent. Encouraging rebound in building permits, but prudent management tone. Nexity saw a pick-up in building permits granted in September. Thus, as at the end of September, the number of permits obtained by Nexity was up +8% vs. 2019 (while the latest market data available indicates that the market was still -6% below 2019 in August). Overall, this had driven a +6% q/q increase in commercial offer, and it should support growth in the residential real estate development segment. However, during the conference call, management was cautious, arguing that these permits may have been too late to have a significant impact on 2021 revenue. FY-21 guidance reiterated: The group reiterated its guidance of €4.4bn revenue pro forma of the divestments (vs. €4.5bn consensus). It also reiterated its >8% current EBIT margin (vs. 8.1% consensus). The company guides for a double-digit growth in residential development, a high single-digit growth in services, and a decline in commercial development (due to the high comp. base). The high comp. base in Q4 seems well understood by the market: The company guidance of €4.4bn revenue in 2021 implies €1.3bn revenue in Q4-21, down -33% y/y. The high comp. base effect is due to the non-repetition of the one-off c.€400m revenue contribution in Q4-20 from the start of the Engie Eco Campus programme (with initial recognition of the land value through the P&L).

DUFN SW,DUFN,Oct 28 2021 02:09AM,Dufry,Retail,Q3 trading update broadly in-line - Q4 outlook subdued ,"Q3 trading update came broadly in-line with our expectations. As expected, the momentumimproved during the summer, driven by the EMEA and Americas region, although Asia-Pac remains the sweet spot. Limited sequential improvement has been seen in October (still c.40% below 2019), likely implying some consensus downward adjustments for Q4. Eq. FCF scenario has been upgraded, with a solid cash performance had during the summer and additional MAG relief agreements, which should not be a surprise to investors. Net, we see this release as broadly in-line and do not see any reason to turn more constructive. ","Conference call 2.30pm CET. e@ Outlook - 2021 Eq FCF scenario upgrade: 1) revenue scenario is left -55%/-40% vs. 2019, with the low-end still demanding in our view. Consensus currently look for FY21 revenue of CHF4,101m, or 52% below 2019 (SFe -54%). It implies Q4 revenue c.30% below 2019, which look ambitious based on most recent trends (October c.40% below 2019), and we thus expect some downward adjustments; 2) Eq FCF monthly scenario is upgraded from CHF-30m/+2m to CHF-13m/+13m. Additional MAG reliefs have been signed, now amounting to c.CHF1.1bn (vs. c.CHF0.5bn as of July-21), including the Spanish law amendment. Costs savings this year are now expected at c.CHF1.9bn vs. c.CHF1.2bn previously. e@ Q3 revenue and October trading update: organic revenue 44% below Q3-19, broadly in-line with our expectations (-43%). It implies further improvement throughout the quarter compared to the previously communicated July trading of -50%. In October the group expects revenue to be c.40% below 2019 (broadly in-line with September at c.-42%), including EMEA at -38% and the Americas at c.-39% (including -26% in the U.S). Sales capacity reached 84% at the end of September, which is expected to improve to 85% by the end of October. Regional performance: 1) EMEA showed a significant acceleration in Q3, as expected, thanks to the strength of leisure demand, with organic sales c.49% below 2019 (vs. -79% Q2); 2) Asia- Pacific did not show signs of improvement, still 86% below 2019, implying a deterioration vs. Q2 (-82%) with some renewed restrictions in some countries; 3) The Americas also improved sequentially being 40% below 2019 in Q3 vs. -51% Q2, benefiting from the U.S domestic demand and a pick-up in travel into Central America and the Caribbean. e@ Cash performance: Eq. FCF turned positive as expected in Q3, reaching CHF254m (vs. CHF-219m Q1 / CHF-56m Q2), broadly in-line with 2019 levels. July accounted for 40% of the quarterly FCF generation.

EBITDA increasein Nutrition at high single digits (cons. 8.4%, Stifel 9.3%) and group adj. EBITDA growth to be in mid-teens (cons./Stifel 17.6%). In Q3-21, Nutrition organic growth of +8% was better than our expectation of +5%, driven exclusively by Animal Nutrition. Nutrition Adj. EBITDA €366m was in line (cons. €365m, Stifel €367m), however, the margin declined by -130bps y/y and q/q to 20.7%. DSM highlights one-off effects including a lifetime extension project at a vitamin plant, adding up to a negative impact of €10-15m, i.e. 60-80bps in the EBITDA margin. Moreover, strong growth in Animal Nutrition speaks for a negative mix effect in the margin. ","Animal Nutrition: Q3 volume growth at +14% was driven by good development in all species along with strong recovery in aquaculture. DSM also mentions high inventory levels at customers amid ongoing supply chain concerns. Geographically, LatAm was strong while North America saw some softness caused by ongoing labour shortages in the meat packaging industry. Human Nutrition: organic growth was in line with our expectations with continued positive trends at immunity-related products, Pharma and Medical Nutrition.

BAYN GY,BAYN,Nov 09 2021 03:03AM,Bayer,Pharmaceuticals,Q3 with good progress in Crop Science ,"Bayer slightly adjusted its group EBITDA margin guidance by 50bps, which translatesto €200m higher EBITDA guidance. The FCF guidance was increased by €1.5bn, exclusively due to lower litigation payments in 2021, as previously indicated by the company. Crop Science posted +26% y/y organic growth (from a low level) in Q3. Crop Science EBITDA clearly beats expectations. The head of the segment Liam Condon steps down and the COO of Crop Science, Rodrigo Santo will be the new head. We see the change of top management as a good sign for a fresh start. Q3 clean group EBITDA came in at €2.09bn (+16% y/y, Stifel: €2.06bn, consensus: €1.94bn). The beat came from CropScience, which recovered from the trough of last year. ","e@ CropScience achieved a strong EBITDA of €471m (Stifel: €448m, consensus: €353m). Earnings included licence fees, which were already booked in Q2 last year. Crop protection revenue was up +11% y/y (Corteva: +19%, BASF: +8%). Bayer benefited from materially higher prices for glyphosate but had to hold the production site in the US due to Hurricane Ida for five weeks. Herbicide sales were just up by +15% y/y (Corteva: +31%). Bayer was ahead of Corteva in insecticides with +9% versus +3%. However, Corteva gained momentum with +26% in fungicides compared with +4% at Bayer. In seed, Q3 is mainly driven by corn, which was up +60% at Bayer compared with +40% at Corteva. However, this might be distorted due to phasing effects. YTD, corn at Corteva is up +6% and at Bayer +11%. It looks similar with soybean seed, which was up +31% y/y in Q3 at Corteva versus +58% at Bayer and YTD Corteva grew +7% versus Bayer with +19%. e@ Pharma EBITDA below expectations, but guidance confirmed: Earnings are affected by launch and marketing costs in the US, as indicated by the company in advance, and also higher R&D for cell and gene therapy. The Q3 EBITDA margin was 30%. However, after 32.8% in H1, Bayer still feels on track to deliver the 32% margin guidance for the full year. Xarelto and Eylea developed well and met market expectations. Sales of not- disclosed by products increased from €616m in Q3-20 to €722m this year, but did not show a sequential improvement. However, Bayer mentions good momentum at Nubegqa, Verquvo and Kerendia. e@ Consumer Health still with low seasonal sales from allergy+cough+tcold indication. However, Nutritionals are still in high demand with sales up +20% y/y. Pain and Cardio contributed +17% and finally Allergy & Cold started to recover with +7%. The segment is also in line with the margin guidance of 22-23% for FY-21 having achieved 22.9% in Q3 despite a negative impact from the recall of spray products. Q3-21 at a glance Stifel Cons.

SGL increased the FCF guidance significantly from EUR >+20m to significantly higher than FCF of 2020 (EUR 94m). YTD, SGL already generated EUR 123m FCF. The disposal of properties and strong dividend for at-equity participation were higher than capex. Capex will be just EUR 50m in 2021 (previously EUR 60m). Despite much stronger business activities, NWC was virtually flat YTD. Net debt decreased to EUR 192m, which is EUR 95m less than at FY-20. In combination with falling pension provisions, the balance sheet structure has greatly improved. ","Graphite Solutions was the main driver of the y/y earnings improvement. EBITDA exceeded the level of the two preceding quarters. The EBITDA margin achieved a high level of 21% in Q3. The solid revenue performance is driven by the growth end- markets, semiconductor, LED and automotive. These markets represent now 40% of segment sales. We assume that these end-market have also a higher margin, therefore the mix increased the margin despite rising raw material costs. Process Technology did not progress. The business is held back by higher raw material costs and supply restrictions. According to the company, the business will not start to improve before 2022. Carbon Fibres are affected by higher raw material and energy costs, which especially impacts the textile fibre business. However, sales to the automotive industry were flat q/q. (largest customer BMW reported for Q3: volume: i3 retail: -24% y/y, group: -10% y/y). Composite Solutions was the positive surprise in H1 and solid Q3 results show that this was not just a one-time event. Sales were flat q/q and confirms also that the business is robust despite the current headwinds in the automotive industry.

IAG SM,IAG,Nov 05 2021 04:24AM,Int. Airlines Group,Airlines & Airports,"Q3 worse, but prospects better than peers' ","IAG reports a Q3 adj. EBIT loss of -€485m (SFe: -€483m, cons.: -€536m), i.e. slightly aboveexpectations, but —as expected — worse than that of peers (Lufthansa and Air France-KLM). IAG plans to operate ~60% of 2019 capacity levels in Q4 (SFe: ~67%). Furthermore, the company guides for a FY-21 adj. EBIT loss of €3bn (cons. -€2.8bn, SFe: -€3.0bn). Commentary into 2022 signals a substantial recovery of bookings on the back of the opening of the transatlantic market. So while IAG looks to have lagged peers in the initial phase of the recovery, the momentum from here seems increasingly positive. We also believe mid-term fundamentals remain more solid. [AG's home markets will likely benefit from meaningful consolidation (esp. UK-US and Spain-LATAM) and IAG has used the crisis to restructure the BA cost base significantly during the coronavirus crisis. We do not see a risk of another capital raise or significant equity valuation issues from increased net debt. We stick to Buy. ","Q3 numbers: e@ The group operated ~43% of 2019's passenger capacity in Q2 (SFe: 45%) with a load factor at 69%. Q3 adj. EBIT loss stands at -€452m (SFe: -€483m, cons.: -€536m). Albeit slightly better than market expectations, it is worse than peers’: both Lufthansa (+€17m) and Air France-KLM: (+ €132m) returned to profitability in Q3. IAG, as expected, suffered from stricter restrictions in the UK and Ireland that prevailed during Q3. Furthermore, IAG has less offset from cargo profits compared with peers given the smaller size of IAG Cargo. Accordingly, the adj. EBIT loss was driven by BA (-£386m) and Aer Lingus (-€80m), while Iberia was profitable (+€21m) and Vueling at breakeven (€0m). Net debt stands at €12.4bn, slightly up from €12.1bn at the end of Q2. e@ Liquidity (pro forma 1 November) stands at a comfortable €12.1bn (was €10.8bn at the end of Q2), after the £1bn UKEF five-year facility secured by BA recently. Outlook/trends: e@ For FY-21, the company expects an adj. EBIT loss of -€3bn. That compares with our FY-21 adj. EBIT estimate of -€3.0bn and consensus at -€2.8bn. e@ For FY-22, IAG expects to return to profitability (SFe: adj. EBIT of €1.3bn). e@ Q4 capacity is expected at ~60% (SFe: ~67%). IAG sees a ""substantial recovery in bookings after UK and US announcements to loosen travel restrictions"" and plans on ""continued capacity increases during Winter 2021/22 and Summer 2022"". e@ Capex guidance is cut to €1.3bn (from €1.7bn) on aircraft delivery delays.

HEI GY,HEI,Nov 04 2021 02:35PM,HeidelbergCement AG,Building Materials,Q3-21 Conference Call Feedback: Some Important Points to Note ,"The HeidelbergCement conference call has raised a number of important points,which, however, were not fully explored, in our view. As a result, we believe the 2021 EBITDA consensus appears to be at risk by no more than -2-3%, while 2022 could actually be a better year than so far assumed. We also believe that the industry has stronger pricing power than perceived even by management itself. We would hence not be surprised to see the market reconsider its reaction tomorrow. This remains a reflation story that should continue to benefit from stimulus and the indirect benefits of higher commodity prices on demand and pricing. Buy HeidelbergCement with a price target of €85. ","Downside to 2021E consensus should be slightly less bad than what the share price told us today. The FY-21 guidance talks about a strong increase in LFL operating EBITDA (RCOBD) and operating EBIT (RCO). This, in our view, should imply LFL growth >5%. YTD, the group achieved LFL EBITDA growth of +8.4%. This means that Q4-21 LFL EBITDA could decline by -5% and still achieve at least +5% LFL growth. If the group achieved +6% or +7% FY-21 LFL EBITDA growth, then Q4-21 LFL EBITDA growth would decline either by a mere -1% or actually increase marginally by +2-3%. In short, assuming +6% or +7% LFL EBITDA growth for 2021, then consensus would come down -1.7% to -2.6% (Figure 1). The share price was down -3.2% on the day. Figure 1 - Consensus Downside Assuming +5-8% 21E LFL EBITDA Growth LFL Growth 21E 5% 6% 7% 8% In Euro millons Implied LFL EBITDA € 3,892 € 3,929 € 3,966 € 4,004 Scope €29 -€29 -€29 -€29 FX -€60 -€60 -€60 -€60 2021E EBITDA € 3,803 € 3,840 € 3,877 € 3,914 21E Consensus € 3,943 € 3,943 € 3,943 € 3,943 21E EBITDA vs Consensus~ -3.5% -2.6% -1.7% -0.7% Source: Stifel Research & estimates The Commercial Excellence programme and its pricing impact should be more important relative to the cost increases for 2022 than so far set out. The point is that the >€350m target implies only +2% pricing upside, while this year alone the group should have seen ~4% price increases. Energy costs YTD amounted to €1,313m, increasing +17.5% or €196m (€130m in Q3-21 alone). Assuming an additional €150m energy cost inflation in Q4-21, then the FY-21E energy bill could be ~€1,850m (vs €1,506m in 2020). If we then take the H2-21E energy bill and double it for next year we get to ~€2,078m, which is ~€228m ahead of that of 2021. If the Operational and Commercial Excellence programmes deliver >€500m in 2022, then this energy cost increase should be ‘easily’ absorbed. A repeat of this year’s ~4% price increase would imply ~€700-750m on top of the €150m in efficiency gains. Clearly, the impact of volumes, FX and cost inflation elsewhere also need to be taken into account. At +4% cost inflation that could make up ~€500m. Given the above, 2022 could pan out to be a reasonable year after all, as long as the group delivers on its programmes and costs increase in line with current inflation rates. Historically, inflation tends to support higher REAL prices in the industry (Figures 2 & 3). More importantly, the sector seems to perform strongly during inflationary periods (Figure 4, going back to 1916). Management stated that the programme is more of an internal and external signal that more needs to be done on this front because historically the industry was not that good at recovering prices. We would disagree with this statement in as far as REAL cement prices have been particularly strong during inflationary periods (as we note from the US and Indian examples), while REAL aggregates prices are at a 105-year high. Maybe it is simply matter of getting used to inflation and how to run one's pricing policy within such an environment. We put the management's statement on this in context of a 30-40 year low inflation environment.",Tobias Woerner,Tobias Woerner,85,,Buy,,EUR,8.04,,8.81,,2.3,2.51,,,,,M,STIFEL_Q3-21 Conference_FlashCoNote_Nov 04 2021 02-35PM.pdf,STIFEL_Q3-21 Conference_FlashCoNote_Nov 04 2021 02-35PM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=92b341df-0114-4843-8349-f856b35317be&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
BUCN SW,BUCN,Oct 22 2021 04:35PM,Bucher Industries,Capital Goods,Q3-21 preview / Bucher's party still in full swing ,"Ahead of Bucher's upcoming Q3-21 reporting of divisional sales and orderintake figures, we took a closer look at different agricultural market data which continue to look relatively supportive for the coming months (equipment prices on the rise, supportive commodity prices, dealer inventories rather below average). e Nonetheless, the momentum peak seems to have been surpassed already and recent European surveys are also revealing that supply bottlenecks could soon limit nearer-term growth momentum. e Following the release of strong half-year results and recently still solid market data, we have finally also upgraded our overly conservative estimates (EPS 21/22/23E +23%/+15%/+7%). Nonetheless, we stick to our prior price target of CHF 485 as valuation multiples for agricultural equipment operators clearly contracted in the recent weeks. Interestingly, our historical share price correlation analysis revealed that these names typically show the highest correlation between different metrics (84-90% depending on the time frame) for the Bucher share. ","Q3-21 figures / October 26 As shown in the attached overview table, we expect group orders to grow by around +16% yoy and sales by even +22% yoy. In line with prior years, the company will not host an official quarterly conference call. Thus far, no major tractor manufacturer has published figures for the third quarter, which will mostly happen during the course of November. Mixed valuation picture shows limited fundamental downside potential Following the recent share price drop the stock is now only trading at 12.1x EV/EBIT 22E. This compares with the Swiss Industrials market average of 16.5x while the recent double-digit de-rating of other agricultural equipment peers only shows an average level of 11.1x.

SFER IM,SFER,Nov 10 2021 01:00AM,Salvatore Ferragamo,Consumer Goods,Q3-21 results: a relatively strong footing ,"Ferragamo Q3 results were aligned with our expectations, while beatingconsensus thanks to some re-orders and delivery shifts in the wholesale channel and strict opex control. e Commentary on current trading confirmed industry trends of a sequential acceleration of growth in October, while the structural cost savings initiatives, coupled with selective price increases should leave some room for upgrades to consensus earnings estimates. e We confirm our Hold rating and increase our PT to €19.5 (from €19.0) on the back of higher FY-21/22 estimates and better NFP. ","Q3 sales were better than consensus, in line with SFe: Ferragamo reported Q3 sales of €262m, 3% above consensus but in line with our expectations, implying a sequential improvement of the turnover recovery vis-a-vis 2019, from -28% in Q2 to -10% in Q3. As expected this was driven by: Sequential improvement in retail: from -11% in Q2 to -6% in Q3 vis-a-vis 2019, despite the enduring lockdowns in some countries, and restrictions to international traffic. Four areas, namely Greater China, North America, LatAm, and Korea, exceeded pre-Covid levels, while e-commerce continued to grow at a strong, albeit normalising double-digit rate (+24% in Q3 vs +66% in Q2). Wholesale was up +11% at c.FX, benefiting from some delivery shifts and reorders from some US accounts. Sequential acceleration in North America, sustained momentum in China and Korea, improving trends in Europe and LatAm. Still resilient trends in high margin product categories, namely leather goods handbags and shoes. Profitability beat consensus, aligned with SFe: Higher full-price sales, positive geographic mix, channel mix, and product mix all contributed to 6.4ppts gross margin expansion in Q3 to 65.3%. This was slightly below our and consensus expectations and could have been driven by some outlets' activity during the quarter (inventory was down -21% at c.FX) which management flagged during the call. Nevertheless, the continued streamlining of the organisation, coupled with strict control over costs, has offset a lower contribution from one-offs components such as Government subsidies to labour and rent relief, driving EBIT to €19m (vs SFe at €20m and consensus at €12m). Outlook: Management considers the current consensus revenue estimate as feasible (€1.13bn), also thanks to the improving performance recorded in the month of October and selective price increases, while profitability may continue to benefit from ongoing structural cost savings initiatives, implying some upside to the current consensus. Mr Gobbetti confirmed to join early 2022: This is a positive piece of news after the company has recently reinforced its managerial structure in North America and EMEA with the appointment of two new key hires with long-lasting experience in the luxury industry. This should help the company to strengthen its managerial structure and speed up the onboarding process ahead of the arrival of the new CEO.",Daniele Alibrandi,Daniele Alibrandi,19.5,19,Hold,,EUR,0.34,,0.49,,0.2,0.29,,,,,M,STIFEL_Q3-21 results-_CoNote_Nov 10 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Q3-21 results-_CoNote_Nov 10 2021 01-00AM,EARNINGS UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=b8fabcd3-eb08-486d-ab56-521707fd3d96&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
ADEN SW,ADEN,Nov 02 2021 03:24AM,Adecco,Business Services,Q3-21 results first take ,"Overall, Q3 results came broadly in line with what could have been expected inour view. Revenue was slightly below expectations, down -1% q/q, notably due to supply chain disruptions. However, the gross profit margin continued to expand (above consensus), thus driving a slight 4% beat on adj. EBITA as SG&A expenses remained under control. The outlook remains clouded by the current supply-chain uncertainties; therefore we see little upside to consensus estimates for now. ","Revenue came in 1% below consensus at €5,220m, up +9% organically y/y. Revenue was thus down -1% q/q, and the two-year stacked organic growth was -7% (vs. -6% in Q2). Adecco highlights the negative impact of supply chains disruptions (notably in auto), and the under-supply of workforce in the U.S. and Europe for certain sectors. ADEN also mentions ‘legacy issues' in its U.S. activity, such as an adverse sector mix. Overall, Flexible Placement (temps), accounting for 82% of revenue, remained on a steady 2-year stacked organic trend of -10% vs 2019. Permanent Placement (perms) remained a key growth driver, up +74% organically, now 10% above the 2019 level. And, as expected, Career Transition continued to decline. Gross Profit was 1% above consensus at €1,086m. The gross profit margin came in 50bps above consensus at 20.8%, up +120bps y/y and +70bps q/q. The improvement continued to be driven by perms and temps, more than offsetting the decline in counter-cyclical Career Transition services. Adj. EBITA came in 4% above consensus at €250m, implying a 4.8% adj. EBITA margin, up +20bps y/y and +30bps q/q, and 25bps above consensus. SG&A came broadly in line with expectations: up +1% q/q and +14% y/y. The beat was driven by the c.€10m beat on Gross Proft dropping through to the adj. EBITA. Outlook: ADEN highlights the continued supply-chain related uncertainties. Thus, ADEN guides for revenue to grow 'modestly on a sequential basis' in Q4-21, while current consensus implies +9% q/q revenue growth in Q4. The group reiterated its FY-21 target of c.50% drop-down ratio (conversion of incremental gross profit into incremental EBITA). Overall, we would expect consensus to lower its revenue estimates, but lift Gross Profit margin. Thus, we do not expect major changes to EPS for now.

WIE AV,WIE,Nov 09 2021 02:50AM,Wienerberger,Construction Supplier,Q3-21 Results — A Strong End To The Year ,"Wienerberger reported a very strong Q3-21 set of results comfortably beatingconsensus, while at the same time raising EBITDA guidance. The Group really benefited from superior supply chain and energy cost management in what could have been a very challenging quarter. Renovation activity and housing were strong in Europe (especially the UK and Belgium), while Central Eastern European markets (such as Poland and Hungary) showed first signs of recovery. Putting these strong underlying trends, the recovery potential in CEE, in context of the very attractively valued North American and UK acquisitions, the stock should be set to move swiftly towards and possibly beyond our PT of €37. The valuation still remains very attractive, well below its thirty-year average. ","Comfortably beating consensus and raising guidance. Q3-21 LFL EBITDA increased +15% to €200.7m beating consensus by +6.7%. Margins still expanded 78bp to 19.7%, despite the cost pressures during the quarter (see Figure 2). This is quite an achievement, in our view. Piping Solutions did particularly well, beating consensus by +21.5%. This was mainly due to solid infrastructure markets in Europe (especially in CEE), good price, energy cost and supply chain management. LFL EBITDA guidance for FY-21 was raised to €650m (from €620-640m), the second raise this year alone, coming after three increases in 2020. Reported EBITDA consensus sits at €653.8m for 2021 and if adjusted for scope and FX, then this should probably be at ~€638m. So, the raise in guidance would represent an increase of ~2%. Driven by very attractive M&A. The Meridian deal was finally closed on 8 October with a potential EBITDA of USD 120m implying a 4.1x multiple. This was an important deal for the Group making it the market leader in the US. The acquisition of FloPlast and Cork Plastics, with high exposures to the UK and Ireland, should turn the Piping Solutions division into a more value add proposition (from ‘Rain to Drain’). That being said, it is not as an attractive acquisition as was Meridian, in our view, both in terms of valuation and market position. We believe there is much more value to be lifted in the Piping Solutions division. The stock's valuation still looks very attractive to us, especially after the share price decline over the summer. Good years normally come in threes or fours. So, we would expect the valuation to remain above its long-term median for some time (see Figure 3). At 1.3x 21E EV/Sales (pre IFRS16) this multiple drops quickly to 1.1x in 22E once the acquisitions are fully integrated. This is before factoring in a margin of 16.4%, which compares to the long-term median at 15.2%. In terms of EV/EBITDA the stock now sits at ~7.9x 21E (pre IFRS16), which once the deals are included, falls to 6.6x 22E. This still leaves ample upside potential for the stock. Our 22E valuation methodology would imply upside to ~€40 (backed up by our SOTP, see Figure 4). Thus, our €37 PT could prove conservative.

The adjusted Q3-21 EBITDA margin of 27.1% missed both consensus (28.0%) and our (28.4%) forecasts and declined by 310bp y-o-y due to higher raw material, freight and energy costs as well as higher SG&A expenses. ","On the back of the 9M-21 I-f-l organic growth rate of +7.1% (SFe 7.8%), the company confirms FY-21 growth guidance for core revenue growth in local currency of 4-6% and comments that ""the upper half of the 4-6% range remains a possibility"" (cons. +6.4%; SFe 7.4%). However, previous wording of ""strong first-half performance opens up the possibility of growth in the upper half of the range"" perhaps sounds somewhat more optimistic. No change in adj. EBITDA margin guidance of 27-28% (cons. 27.6%, SFe 28.0%). We expect FY-21 consensus estimates to be revised downwards at the top line as well as on the margin level. The company expects a rather weak growth rate in Q4-21. Q3-21 organic growth rate of +4.2% after +5.0% in Q2-21 and +13.4% in Q1-21: Adjusted for the scope effect of the first-time full consolidation of the former MEA joint venture and FX, SIG Combibloc achieved an underlying growth rate of +4.2% in Q3-21 (cons +4.9%, SFe +5.9%), following the I-f-| growth of +8.8% in H1-21. The adjusted EBITDA margin was up 40bp to 27.2% (cons. 27.6%; SFe 27.7%) in 9M21 but down 310bp to 27.1% in Q3-21 (cons. 28.1%, SFe 28.4%) on the back of higher raw material, freight and energy costs as well as higher SG&A.

New Hochwald fillers to come onstream in 2022. First-time consolidation of the former MEA joint venture: Adding €60.5m/161.1m to SIG Combibloc's top line in Q3/9M (SFe €68.4m/169.0m). Sales were -7.1% I-f-I in the seven months consolidated (high comps in Q3, lower out-of-home consumption, drought in South Africa). Solid growth in APAC despite some pandemic headwind: Core revenue growth in local currency of +6.3% in Q3 (to €173.3m; SFe €184.3m), after +2.5% in Q2 and +11.4% in Q1, despite the fact that on-the-go consumption is still affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in South-East Asia. Consumption in China remains strong (white milk). New fillers in South Korea and Taiwan. e@ Ongoing high at-home consumption in Latin America, re-opening of restaurants in the US as growth drivers for the Americas region: After strong core revenue growth in local currency of +18.5% in Q2 and 41.6% in Q1-21 based on strong at- home consumption across the region, Q3-21 growth was still exceptional at +18.6% (SFe +5.6%) and marks the positive surprise in today's reporting (Q3 sales of €94.2m vs. SFe of €83.8m). At-home consumption remained high in Brazil and Mexico, but is now slowing as office working has started to resume. Re-opening of restaurants and re-stocking of foodservice products supported performance in the US. Strong free cash flow generation: Beside the performance in Americas, this is the second positive item in today's reporting, with €141.7m surpassing last year's level of €124.5m. Confirmed FY-21 guidance, but some cautious wording: SIG confirms its 4-% I- f-l core revenue guidance and talks about a possibility to end in the upper half of the 4-6% range (H1-21 wording ""opens up the possibility of growth in the upper half of the range"").

IRE IM,IRE,Oct 29 2021 10:44AM,Iren,Utilities,Q3-21 results should highlight Iren's positive exposure to high power prices ,"lrenis publishing Q3/9M-21 results on 11 November. On the same day the companywill present to the financial community its new business plan. For Q3-21 we expect double-digit growth both at EBITDA level and the bottom line. We estimate that EBITDA would grow by 14% y/y, mainly driven by the positive impact on margins from high power prices in the Italian market. We estimate that net profit would increase by 52% y/y, also thanks to the significant cost of debt reduction versus Q3-20. Net debt would increase by a modest 4% versus end 2021. Strong operating cash flow would offset most of the cash out for dividend payments in the period ","~~ and capex acceleration. We recently upgraded to Buy our rating on the stock. We expect the new business plan to restore investor confidence in Iren's low-risk value creation story while providing visibility on the additional value-creation potential offered by the company in its businesses linked to the circular economy. A convincing value- accretive investment plan in renewable power generation capacity would provide upside to our estimates and valuation. In our opinion, the current share price does not properly reflect the positive exposure of Iren's margins to the new scenario of high power prices in the Italian market. Our detailed estimates for Q3-21 are as follows: EBITDA would increase by 14% y/y to €205m. Main growth drivers would be represented by 1) the power generation business (EBITDA +36% y/y to €37m), and 2) the waste business (EBITDA +53% y/y to €61m). Both divisions would benefit from the sharp increase in power prices in the Italian market in the quarter (they tripled versus Q3-20 to €125/MWh), thanks to the significant portion of Iren's hydro and WTE power generation volumes not hedged in the past months. Growth in those two divisions would be partially offset by lower supply margins. We estimate that EBITDA in the market division would decline by 42% y/y to €11m. EBITDA in the networks business would continue its positive trend, posting 3% y/y growth to €96m, mainly driven by investments in the water sector. Net profit would increase by 52% y/y to €31m. Growth at the bottom line would also benefit from declining interest charges, driven by cost of debt reduction. e@ Capex would continue to accelerate. We expect that it would be 38% higher than in Q3-20, reaching €220m. Net debt would increase by a modest 4% versus end 2021, to €3.05bn.

DIS IM,DIS,Nov 12 2021 01:00AM,d’Amico International Shipping S.A.,Industrials,Q3-21: Improving sentiment ,"While Q3 results reflected very tough prevailing market conditions in theproduct tankers space, d'Amico delivered an in-line set of results compared to expectations ahead of the crucial Q4. With the oil demand recovery underway and global destocking approaching a trough, we believe that we are now very close to an inflection point. Improving spot rates, as well as interesting contracts by charterers looking to secure cover in what is expected to be a stronger market, is an early bullish indicator. This is before mentioning the healthy underlying market fundamentals. We will review our outdated estimates in due course to account for ","lower AVG daily TCE rate for FY-21, as a result of lower assumption on spot rates, a different fleet profile, as well as the new bareboat contract bringing a lower cost profile. d'Amico delivered an overall in-line set of results in Q3-21, with the main deviations vs our expectations being represented by a $5.8m asset impairment booked for the disposal of High venture MR, partially offset by lower than expected financial charges. TCE earnings were down -22% YoY and -9% QoQ, to $42mn in Q3, with a total daily average TCE (Spot and Fixed) of $12,113/day (vs. SFe $12,200). This was driven by a good level of coverage of ~48% and a stable QoQ level of fixed rates ($/15,163day in Q3 vs $15,231/day in Q2), compensating for the still weak product tanker environment, as reflected by spot rates of $9,248/day. As for profitability, EBITDA of €14.9m came in modestly better than expected, while the Adj. Net Loss of -€8m was a clear beat due to lower financial expenses. Net Debt excl. IFRS-16 stood at €452m, or 61% of the overall fleet market value, an improvement vs 65% in H1 thanks to the ongoing recovery in asset values. Current newsflow reflects improved sentiment: The recently signed agreement to bareboat charter-out to a well-regarded counterparty MT Cielo di Londra LR1 vessel for 5 years at a very profitable rate (extendable for a further 2 years at increasing rates) is a clear positive for two reasons. First, it highlights the improving sentiment in the product tankers space, showing clients' commitment to pay higher prices upfront vis- a-vis still depressed spot rates ahead of a potential rebound in the market. Second, this contract should help to improve d'Amico's cost profile, as the whole vessel management is demanded of the charterer, from the operations (voyages costs) to the technical administration (maintenance and repairs). Promising outlook: A recovery in oil demand and refining throughputs is underway, with an acceleration anticipated over November and in particular December, while refined products inventories have rebalanced towards a more normalised levels. Near-term demand is inflecting thanks to increased vehicle miles driven in several large consuming regions, as well as improving trends in jet fuel consumption (DIS’s of jet-fuel transported on total volume increased from 3% in Q1 to 12.5% in Q3), not mentioning the role that oil could play in partially addressing the ongoing energy crunch, driving more volumes of fuel oil transportation during winter. More interestingly, asset values, which are still well below cycle peaks, have continued to improve in Q2 and Q3 at a time when the overall world fleet is getting older and a pick-up in scrapping is increasing, leading to slow fleet growth.",Daniele Alibrandi,Daniele Alibrandi,0.15,,Buy,,USD,-0.02,,0.02,,0,0,,,,,M,STIFEL_Q3-21- Improving_FlashCoNote_Nov 12 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Q3-21- Improving_FlashCoNote_Nov 12 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=3e684295-e2d6-4661-959d-344ea2d89ac1&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
TOD IM,TOD,Nov 11 2021 01:00AM,Tod's,Consumer Goods,"Q3-21: Reassuring, but not out of the woods yet ","Tod's reported a better than expected set of Q3-21 results, with the 7% beat toconsensus implying a low single-digit sales upgrade in FY-21 (2-3% to c.€840m; SFe €841m). Nevertheless, this is unlikely to drive meaningful earnings revisions for FY-21 as management flagged a ramping up of advertising and marketing investments ahead of the crucial Christmas season. Having said that, we are comfortably sitting on a €6m negative EBIT forecast for FY-21, above consensus of around -€15m and €34m for FY-22 (vs consensus €26m). Current trading indications, pointing to no major disruptions seen so far in October/November, are reassuring at this stage, but in the context of the resurgence of Covid-19 in Asia the business environment remains highly fluid and the situation is in focus. ","Tod's Q3-21 sales came in c.7% above our and consensus estimates to €224m (SFe: €212m; consensus: €209m), implying a faster sequential improvement vis-a-vis 2019, from -8% in Q2 to flat in Q3 (vs -5% expected), with organic growth standing at +14% (vs SFe +7%; consensus: +6%). This was driven by a better than expected sales recovery in Europe, particularly in Italy, sequential acceleration in the US, continued momentum in Asia (in particular China and Korea), and outperformance of the retail channel. By channel, retail improved sequentially from -3% in Q2 to +6% in Q3 vis-a-vis 2019, driven by e-commerce and improving trends in bricks-and-mortars, coming c.6% above expectations. Wholesale was down -10% vs Q3-19 (-20% in Q2 vs 2019), reflecting different timing of deliveries and the ongoing structural downsizing, particularly in Europe. By geography, all divisions except Greater China improved sequentially vs 2019. Americas showed the highest sequential improvement, with Q3-21 sales above 2019 levels (vs -15% in Q2). Both Italy and Europe more than halved the declines registered vs 2019 to around mid-teens in Q3. Greater China was up +50% vs Q3-19, in line with Q2, with Mainland and Korea offsetting the softer performance in Japan, hit by the temporary lockdown. By brand, Tod's and Hogan, largely exposed to Europe, recorded the better sequential improvement, albeit the former still in negative territory vs 2019. Roger Vivier, sequentially slowed down, reflecting a normalising trend in the underlying regions. Current trading is reassuring: management did not see any slowdown in China while flagging an early impact on performances in Japan and Korea on the back of some cases of Covid-19 resurgence. The positive exit rate to the quarter in the US and the ongoing resiliency of the business with local clients in Europe should be enough to offset the softer trends elsewhere. In light of the better than expected sales registered in Q3, management sees some €15-20m (2%) sales upgrade for FY-21 as reasonable.

STMN SW,STMN,Dec 23 2021 01:00AM,Straumann,Medtech,Q4 preview and model update post CMD ," On the CMD, management issued a mid-term guidance of CHF5bn sales by 2030 ata CORE EBIT margin corridor of 25-30%. e@ We increased our FY21 estimates in anticipation of a strong Q4. However, we trimmed our CORE EBIT margin progression post CMD. e We reiterate our Hold rating and PT of CHF 1,820 ","Another strong quarter, with double-digit growth ahead We became more constructive on patient flow already in our last note and believe that this momentum is going to continue into Q4. We do not expect any holiday season related weakness in the dental implant market. In addition, year-end digital equipment sales should positively contribute to organic growth in the quarter. Therefore, we further upgrade our FY-21 organic revenue growth estimate for Straumann to 39.7% (from 35.1%). For Q4-21, we expect 15.7% organic growth, driven by the following trends: EMEA: Straumann's Medentika and Anthogyr brands continue to benefit from the pull out of competitor Implant Direct from the European market. The TLX implant launch will only have first noticeable impact in Q1-22. In clear aligners, Dr. Smile is now fully consolidated and continues to take share in a healthy market environment. Market share gains are supported by the ongoing geographic expansion as Dr. Smile is now operating in 10 countries in Europe. We estimate 14.2% organic growth for Q4-21. e@ NA: In our view, Straumann is still positively impacted by a persistent supportive market environment in North America coupled with ongoing market share gains, driven by the lack of a competitive answer to the premium BLX implant. We set our organic growth estimate at 15.4%. e@ APAC: Many companies are confronted with a slowdown in the Chinese market since Q4. We believe Straumann's business in China is mostly withstanding this trend and continues to generate solid growth in the current environment. Given the higher comparison base, we set our organic growth estimate to 17.5% Latin America: We forecast another quarter where the company benefits from its superior supply chain and strong offering of NeoDent in Brazil while COVID related impacts are limited in this quarter. We set our organic growth estimate to 21.4%, taking the weak comparison base into account. CHF 5 bn revenue goal by 2030 with a CORE EBIT margin of 25-30% The announced CHF 5bn revenue target translates into an organic growth CAGR of at least 10%. Although this official revenue guidance implies a push back by c. 2 of the original CHF 5bn sales ""vision"", communicated by the chairman to the press in 2019, we believe this was expected by investors and can be well explained with the corona pandemic. The main reason for the share price drop during the CMD was, in our view, the lower end of the CORE EBIT margin corridor at 25%. Initially, this was read as an indication for the margin level in FY22. Based on our follow-up discussions with the company, we do not expect to see such a strong margin contraction next year, but rather read the corridor as the usual conservative communication style of the company. To achieve its financial mid-term goal, Straumann has identified three key pillars. The company wants to further gain market share in the core implantology business (current market share 29%) through innovation and an expanding geographic presence. Further, management expects over proportioned growth from Clear Aligners up to top-line revenue of CHF 1.3-1.7 bn. Lastly, Straumann is targeting a significant increase in revenue from the APAC region and specifically in China up to the range of 20-30% of group revenue. Reiterate Hold and PT of CHF 1,820 Our DCF-derive PT is CHF 1,820. We increased our short-term growth estimates due stronger momentum in Q4, while cutting our CORE EBIT margin trajectory.

BAS GY,BAS,Dec 10 2021 01:00AM,BASF,Chemicals,R&D event feedback ,"“The transformation towards sustainability starts in research"" is the agenda of thenew CTO (since 02/21), Melanie Maas-Brunner, explained on BASF's R&D event. BASF spent c. EUR 2bn on R&D with 10,000 employees in 2020. The overall goals in BASF's innovations are to support the net zero target by 2050, enhance circular economy and develop sustainable product solutions (growing share of accelerator products). The event focused on sustainability and mobility. ","New R&D organization: As before with the central functions, BASF will move R&D closer to the business units. R&D with high customer proximity (representing c. 6,500 employees), previously part of one of the three central research divisions, will move to the segments. The central research will be bundled in one research division with 3.500 employees. The new organization should make R&D more agile and shorten the time to market. e-mobility Automotive as growth market: According to BASF, the chemical content in EVs is 2.5x by value larger than in ICE cars. The change of the powertrain affects the concept of the entire car. Applying 2.5x metric on BASF and assuming an EV penetration in new vehicles of 30% by 2030 would translate to >50% revenue growth and suggests the automotive share could increase from 20% to 25%. Battery materials: It is the fastest growing automotive business for BASF. From EUR <1bn sales in 2021, revenues should grow to EUR >7bn by 2030 fueled with EUR 3.5-4bn capex. Plastics: Second-fastest growing area: The safe power distribution, thermal management in batteries, handling of high-voltage and new safety concepts increase the plastic content, especially for new high-end solutions. BASF examples are busbar insulation with new TPUs (lower thermal expansion), PU adhesives (thermal conductivity) for the battery pack, PA for high voltage cables (durable orange color) and plastic crash absorbers and battery protection (stiffness). BASF believes it is well positioned with its polymer portfolio and does not see any need to add other materials. Cooling: Coolant volume is 2x larger in EVs. Battery efficiency relies on the thermal management to always keep temperature in optimal conditions (20-40°C). Safety for crash situation requires reduction of electrical conductivity of coolants, otherwise the formation of H2 and O2 could result in self-igniting gas mixture. BASF launched the new coolant Gklysantin, which substantially reduced the electro-conductivity. Coating: At first glance, automotive coatings seems unaffected by the switch to EVs. However, the higher weight of EVs requires thicker metal parts. In the coating curing step under heat, the thicker metal parts require longer heating times. By reducing the temperature required in the curing step from >155 °C to 140 °C and as of 2023 even down to 130 °C, the process time and use of energy can be optimized. Reduction of CO2 emissions e@ COZ2 free hydrogen via methane pyrolysis: natural gas or bio-methane can be converted by using (renewable) energy to H2 and solid (pure) carbon. The process requires 80% less energy than an electrolyzer, according to BASF. The company has already started a test plant in Ludwighshafen this year and can now work on the process technology and control. Chemicals via fermentation: BASF develops with LanzaTech a process using off-gases and H2 to produce the alcohol n-Octanol used in cosmetic and HPC products. Biodegradable products for detergents and HPC: BASF runs R&D projects to fundamentally understand biodegradation. This know-how, the integration of laboratory and field research and using digital tools can speed up the time to create new sustainable formulations.",Andreas Heine,Andreas Heine;Isha Sharma,81,,Buy,,EUR,7.07,,6.6,,3.4,3.5,,,,,M,STIFEL_R&D event_FlashCoNote_Dec 10 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_R&D event_FlashCoNote_Dec 10 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=873c1aef-c23f-45b8-b5fa-f31b0936d9c1&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

","Given Oracle's large footprint and customer base, the company's accelerating cloud application momentum bodes well for cloud spending in the coming years. Looking ahead, ORCL management remained positive at the analyst call and guided to Cloud revenue growth accelerating further to at least mid-20% in 4Q (vs. 22% in 2Q). We remain optimistic on further acceleration in cloud revenues at SAP in 4Q21 on the back of the strong 3Q Current Cloud Backlog (with S/4HANA backlog up 58%), management's optimistic commentary on S/4HANA rev momentum, increasing large deal 'RISE with SAP"" pipeline and easy comps and improving bookings (DD) at Concur. Furthermore, we expect large deals/volumes to move to S/4HANA Cloud in 4Q, resulting in a bounce in S/4HANA Current Cloud Backlog, which should alleviate investor concerns on the pace of business model transition at SAP.

SAP GY,SAP,Nov 19 2021 02:21AM,SAP SE,Software,Read-across from WDAY 3Q22 results ,"Workday, covered by our colleague Brad Reback, reported 3Q22 revenues / non-GAAP EPS of $1.33bn / $1.10 vs consensus at $1.31bn / $0.87. 3Q subscription rev growth continued to sequentially accelerate, up 21.0% y/y in 3Q, vs +19.5% / +17.0% y/y in 2Q / 1Q. 3Q performance was strong globally with North America outperforming in the enterprise segment. In international markets, the UK, Spain and Switzerland were a standout. ","Management noted overall robust demand dynamics and pipeline momentum particularly aided by the current difficult hiring environment. On the back of this optimism, Workday raised its FY22 guidance to revenue of $5.123-5.125bn, (c.19% growth, $5.09-5.10bn previously), the non-GAAP margin to c.22% (c.21% previously). WDAY management also reiterated its goal of 20% subscription growth in FY23. While WDAY 3Q results and management commentary was upbeat, it fell short of heightened expectations post recent sellside commentary / upgrades resulting in then WDAY stock being down 8% after hours. We remain optimistic on further acceleration in cloud revenues at SAP in 4Q21 on the back of the strong 3Q Current Cloud Backlog (with S/4HANA backlog up 58%), management's optimistic commentary on S/4HANA rev momentum, increasing large deal 'RISE with SAP' pipeline, and easy comps and improving bookings (DD) at Concur. Furthermore, we expect large deals/volumes to move to S/4HANA Cloud in 4Q, resulting in a bounce in S/4HANA Current Cloud Backlog, which should alleviate investors’ concerns on the pace of business model transition at SAP. e@ 3Q22 revs grew by 20.0% y/y to $1.33bn, 1% ahead of cons at $1.31bn (2Q22/3Q21 growth of 19% / 18% y/y). Within this 3Q subscription revs grew by 21.0% y/y (2Q: +19.5% y/y). 3Q non-GAAP op. profit was 25.0% resulting in 3Q EPS of $1.10, significantly higher than cons. at $0.87. Note that profitability continued to be aided by the combination of solid top-line momentum and back-end loaded hiring in the quarter. 3Q22 subscription revenue backlog was $11.0bn, up 23.7% y/y (2Q: +23.1% y/y). Subscription revenue backlog that will be recognised within the next 24 months was $7.1bn, up 19.7% (2Q: +19.7% y/y). Management noted that performance was solid globally with North America outperforming in the enterprise market, while the medium enterprise and international market also saw outperformance, especially in the UK, Spain and Switzerland. Workday raised its FY22 guidance. The company now looks for FY22 revenues of $5.123-5.125bn, or growth of 19%, up from $5.09-5.10bn (+18%). Workday also raised its FY22 non-GAAP op. margins guidance to c.22%, up from c.21% previously. The GAAP op. margin is expected to be lower than the non-GAAP op. margins by c.24 percentage points for FY22. Lastly, FY22 operating cash flow is expected to be $1.65bn ($1.5bn, previously). Elsewhere, WDAY management reiterated its goal of 20% subscription growth in FY23 while the company expects FY23 op. margin to drop to c.18% as S&M expenses rebound from Covid lows. Valuation.

GEBN SW,GEBN,Dec 01 2021 01:50AM,Geberit,Construction Supplier,Reassuring roadshow feedback ,"We hosted a Geberit roadshow in Zurich yesterday, with CEO Christian Buhl andCFO Roland Iff (his very last roadshow — all the best again from our side). ","Overall, management is very confident in its 4% to 6% organic growth target over-the-cycle, seeing growth opportunities in its European expansion markets (outside its mature core markets) and emerging markets (like China or India). Shower toilets should return to double-digit growth again after a weaker Q3-21 (high comps). We reiterate our Buy rating. We are convinced that Geberit will achieve above average growth in the future, despite high FY-21 comps, given its up-selling strategy, innovation and price setting power. Growth discussion: CEO Christian Buhl talked about various growth possibilities such as Geberit's up-selling strategy (selling of higher valued products) in mature markets (Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Benelux, Northern Italy), technology-driven growth such as the behind-the-wall installation in European expansion markets (France, the UK, Iberian Peninsula, the Nordics, Eastern Europe) and the introduction of the European bathroom culture in Asia. Touchless solutions are experiencing significant growth. However, it is still quite insignificant compared to total group sales. There is some catch-up potential for new construction in coming years, as building permits declined during the pandemic. Shower toilet discussion: After a weaker Q3-21 with a small top-line decline (mainly driven by high comps — double-digit growth on average in the last 24 months), the company is convinced that double-digit growth rates can be achieved again in the future. The company has launched new products in recent years, now offering not just premium products (price of around CHF 6,000), but also those in the middle price segment (CHF 2,000 to CHF 2,800) and low price segment (CHF 1,500). In terms of marketing, the company now works with ""local heroes"", i.e. some celebrities known in its various end markets (e.g. volleyball players in Germany, ski jumping athlete in Austria, athletic in Switzerland, celebrity chef in Belgium). Wage inflation and workforce discussion: Wage inflation in FY-22 will most likely be higher than in FY-21 (+1.5%), but not quantifiable yet (negotiations with unions are still ongoing). However, the new targeted minimal salary of EUR 12 per hour in Germany does not have an impact (Geberit pays higher salaries). A recently conducted employee attitude survey showed the highest satisfaction among Geberit's employees. Asking employees about how long they would like to work for Geberit, 80% answered more than five years (and 10% each for between one and five years or less than a year). This 80% of employees with a long-term commitment compares with an industry average of 57%. e@ Q4-21 discussion: Sales growth in October was still slightly positive. So far, overall Q3-21 trend continued. Furthermore, CEO Christian Buhl said that it is a fair assumption that some pre-buying effects ahead of the coming extraordinary price increase as of the beginning of next year could occur. Allocation of capital and M&A discussion: There are no M&A transactions in Geberit's pipeline. Geberit continues to pay out between 50% and 70% of its net income (in recent years more in the upper half of this range) and will continue to buy back shares (Geberit will repurchase shares up to a maximum purchase amount of CHF 500m over a maximum period of two years, i.e. September 2022). Lockdown discussion: Geberit assumes that in potential future lockdowns, construction sites will remain open. Furthermore, potential closure of showrooms does not have a significant impact on Geberit's business (as experienced earlier in this pandemic).",Christian Arnold,Christian Arnold,850,,Buy,,CHF,21.8,,22.3,,13,13.5,,,,,M,STIFEL_Reassuring roadshow_FlashCoNote_Dec 01 2021 01-50AM.pdf,STIFEL_Reassuring roadshow_FlashCoNote_Dec 01 2021 01-50AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=99c3d9bf-fb29-4c30-af27-830fbed8fd42&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
ITRK LN,ITRK,Nov 24 2021 02:38AM,Intertek,Business Services,Reassuring trading update — Outlook confirmed ,"Trading update over July-October comes broadly in line with expectations, inour view. We particularly note the positive momentum, with some weak spots showing an inflection over the period (Building & Construction, Transportation Technologies, Caleb Brett). We would also view this performance positively in terms of profitability, confirming our expectations of a solid H2 margins performance. Net, we believe this is a reassuring release which should be taken positively by investors given the recent disappointments. ","Conference call @ 7.45 am UKT (dial-in: +44 (0) 33 0551 0200). Trading update broadly in line: organic growth over July-October at +5% y/y at the group level, broadly in line with consensus of +4.5% y/y (SFe +4.7%). It implies 2-y stacked organic growth of -1.6%, vs. -3.2% over May-June (-2.4% Jan-April). M&A added 1.7% over the period, while FX brought 4.5% negative impact. Products above 2019 levels (85% of adj. EBIT): organic growth of +5.5% (SFe +5.5%). It implies 2-y stacked growth of +1.3%, vs. flat over H1. In terms of sub- segments, softlines, hardlines, electrical & connected world and business assurance showed a continued positive trend. We note an inflection for Building & Construction (stable over the period vs. low-single digit decline in H1) and Transportation technologies (double-digit growth over the period vs. mid-sngle digit decline in H1). Trade — Meaningful improvement (7% of adj. EBIT): organic growth of +3.7% (SFe +1.5%). Itimplies 2-y stacked growth of -6.8%, vs. -11.5% May-June (-8% Jan-April). The rebound was particularly driven by the Caleb Brett unit with mid-single digit growth over the period (vs. low-single digit decline H1), thanks to improving global mobility. Resources — Slowdown over July-October (5% of adj. EBIT): organic growth of +4.7% (SFe +6%). It implies 2-y stacked growth of -5.5%, vs. -2.5% May-June (-4.5% Jan-April).

VALN SW,VALN,Dec 03 2021 10:04AM,Valora,Retail,Recently worsened covid situation weighs on the stock price ,"The Swiss Federal Government today announced tighter Covid restrictions amidrising Covid cases and fears around the new Omicron variant. From Monday 6th of Dec on, working from home is suggested where possible (non-binding) and public life indoors is further restricted. With the measures, the Swiss government wants to reduce interaction between people with decreased mobility as a consequence. For Valora this means less footfall at its outlets, primarily in transit stations. Similar (more restrictive) measures have already been taken by the Austrian (full lockdown since 22nd of Nov) and the German government (2G ruling for gastronomy a.o. since 17th Nov). Though, lower traffic seems a logical consequence of these measures, it is not clear to what extent sales of Valora will suffer. H1-21 has shown that net sales held up rather well despite the fact, that the lockdown period in 2021 was longer than a year earlier. Reasons for this could be (1) differences in restrictions (e.g. no closure of schools vs. 1st lockdown) or (2) lower obeyance to the rules by citizens (corona fatigue). Recent mobility data on the second page of this flash note seem to confirm the latter (mobility remains above last year's level in Germany and Switzerland), which would argue for a limited impact on Valora's sales. ","Number of outlets. 1,056 (retail Switzerland), 985 (retail Germany, Austria and Luxembourg), 639 (foodservice; thereof c.550 outside Switzerland) Net Sales distribution (FY-20). 63% retail Switzerland, 22.0% retail Germany, 14.5% foodservice, 0.5% other H1-21 vs. H1-20 performance (LC). +0.6% y/y retail Switzerland, -4.7% y/y retail Germany, -6.3% y/y foodservice. Mobility data (see page 2 for charts). Google mobility data show a radical decrease in mobility for Austria after the establishment of the full lock-down on 22nd Nov. But even there must be differentiated, as the lack of a WFH policy caused workplace mobility to drop by much less than for retail and recreation. In fact, workplace mobility remains higher than 1 year ago. Higher mobility levels (for all kind of purposes) remain on higher levels y/y in Switzerland and Germany despite spiking Covid cases. View: Despite the fact that illustrated mobility data (see page 2) shows mobility levels above last year's levels, the re-initiated restrictions, for which an end cannot be foreseen, will clearly have a negative impact on Valora's sales. The impact will probably less intense than feared as mobility and on-the-go consumption remains on solid levels. The negative sentiment, however, weighs on the share price, and we don't expect that to change anytime soon. We, therefore, feel comfortable with our hold rating.",Pascal Boll,Pascal Boll,220,,Hold,,CHF,0.81,,7.17,,0,5.7,,,,,M,STIFEL_Recently worsened_FlashCoNote_Dec 03 2021 10-04AM.pdf,STIFEL_Recently worsened_FlashCoNote_Dec 03 2021 10-04AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=47a74505-fce7-4d62-9156-787b3d2c030d&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
NESN SW,NESN,Dec 08 2021 01:42AM,Nestle,Food & Beverage,Reduction in L‘Oréal stake and new share buyback ,"Nestlé has agreed to sell 22.26m of L'Oréal (OR FP, €424.80, Buy) shares at €400/share, which represents a 5.8% discount to the 07/12 closing price and amounts to a total volume of €8.9bn (CHF 9.4bn). The transaction reduces Nestlé's stake from 23.29% to 20.1%, and Nestlé therefore remains L'Oréal's second largest shareholder behind the Bettencourt family (34.7% stake after share cancellation), represented by two board members. Simultaneously, Nestlé announced the replacement of the existing share buyback programme with a new CHF 20bn programme starting 3 Jan 2022. ","Rationale for Nestlé. Nestlé has owned a stake in L'Oréal since 1974, when the company bought shares for CHF 3.39 (v.s. CHF 415 selling price). It's the first time since 2014 that Nestlé has reduced its stake (reduction from 29.4% to 23.3%). The financial investment has constantly generated value for Nestlé shareholders. Realising some of these gains and re-distributing it to shareholders makes sense in our view. Existing share buyback programme (replaced on 31 Dec 2021): started 1 Jan 2020 (until Dec 2022) with a total initial volume of CHF 20bn. As of 7 Dec 2021, Nestlé bought back 120.3m shares worth CHF 12.7bn (CHF 105.61 average price per share). New share buyback programme (3 Jan 2022 to Dec 2024): Nestlé intends to buy back CHF 20bn in share capital (CHF 10bn in 2022). In case of attractive acquisition targets, Nestlé intends to adjust the programme accordingly. EPS accretion: we expect an incremental EPS accretion of roughly 1.6%/3.1% in FY-22/FY-23 (note our FY-22 EPS estimate already includes an accretive effect from the former programme). View: though we expected Nestlé to sell (part of) its L'Oréal stake in case of a larger acquisition, we believe a partial realisation of the capital gains (tax free as the bought back shares will be cancelled) is nothing negative and shareholders benefit from almost record high share price levels of L'Oréal. At the same time the disposal only comprises a small part of the holding and shareholders will continue to participate in L'Oréal, while Nestlé keeps the flexibility to sell more in the future if/when a suitable acquisition target arises.",Pascal Boll,Pascal Boll,130,,Buy,,CHF,4.51,,4.88,,2.9,3.1,,,,,M,STIFEL_Reduction in_FlashCoNote_Dec 08 2021 01-42AM.pdf,STIFEL_Reduction in_FlashCoNote_Dec 08 2021 01-42AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=5bb25541-7291-4792-84fc-af8b3595db37&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
COTN SW,COTN,Dec 21 2021 01:15AM,Comet,Technology Hardware,Relative underperformance creates window of opportunity ,"Comet has lost around 15% from its peak in November 2021 (SPI IndexAG) e The stock has been lagging Swiss peers VAT and Inficon by 19% and 14%, respectively, since 1 October, which we believe is unjustified. e Stifel outlook for WFE spending in 2022 is raised to +10%. e Market seems to underestimate the overproportional spending in RF power where Comet is leading in certain products and entering new markets (generator). e The relative underperformance within the past two months offers a great opportunity to enter a strongly growing story, in our view. e We remain bullish with a Buy rating and PT of CHF 425. ","Underperformance vs peers is unjustified Comet's share price peaked in November and has lost 15% since then (SPI -1%). More interesting is the weakness vs its Swiss peers VAT and Inficon at around 19% and 14%, respectively. There is no clear reason for this underperformance given Comet is valued below both peers and benefits from similar drivers in the semiconductor end-markets. One reason might be the lack of news from the CMD and the profit taking afterwards. Stifel WFE outlook for 2022 positive - Semi stocks should benefit Our US semi-cap research team updated WFE estimates for 2022 in November. Our colleagues now see growth of 10% (vs +5-6% previously), driven by mainly foundry and logic in the advanced and trailing edge nodes. This will definitely support growth for semiconductor names next year. Increasing complexity indicates overproportional growth for RF power In our view, there is still a misperception that Comet is dependent on spending in the memory business. Comet is very well positioned in all areas where RF power is needed and therefore benefits from overall spending and not memory specifically. Additionally, VLSI still expects RF power to outgrow overall WFE capex in the next few years due to the increased complexity of semiconductor production. Comet is set to benefit strongly from this as itis the market leader in RF matchboxes and vacuum capacitors. In addition, we firmly believe that the market would turn more bullish very quickly if Comet were to report any qualification for its new RF generators. Weaker share price performance creates window of opportunity The weak share price performance and mainly the relative underperformance offer a window of opportunity, in our view. There is no reason why Comet should underperform mainly Inficon in a still bullish semiconductor market (Inficon has less exposure). In addition to still bullish semi markets, Comet is set to benefit from an industrial recovery in its X-ray divisions in 2022 as well. While there is more volatility in technology names these days, investors should not forget the opportunities available to Comet. We remain bullish with a Buy and PT of CHF 425 — strong growth ahead We still estimate revenue CAGR of 13.5% until 2027 with an EBITDA margin moving towards 25% within the next 5-6 years (less aggressive than midterm guidance). This growth is not adequately reflected in the valuation, in our view, and we therefore remain bullish. We see the current weakness as a good entry point, and reiterate our Buy rating and PT of CHF 425.",Michael Inauen,Michael Inauen,425,,Buy,,CHF,7.92,,9.9,,1.42,1.48,,,,,M,STIFEL_Relative underperformance_CoNote_Dec 21 2021 01-15AM.pdf,STIFEL_Relative underperformance_CoNote_Dec 21 2021 01-15AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=a3524cfe-857e-4eba-81ce-280ba6e6addb&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
SYAB GY,SYAB,Nov 10 2021 02:53AM,Synlab AG,Healthcare,Results broadly in line with consensus ,"Synlab's Q3 revenue and adj. EBITDA came in below our estimates, due to alower contribution than expected from COVID-19 testing. The rest of the business has delivered broadly in line. We do not see risk to FY-21 consensus revenue or EBITDA. The group had already raised its FY-21 guidance in early October due to higher COVID-19 testing. The new 2021 guidance implied a 12% upside to consensus unlevered FCF. The group also discloses today its 2022 financial targets, which are broadly in line with consensus expectations. ","Revenue and adj. EBITDA came in below our expectations due to lower-than- expected COVID-19 contribution. COVID-19 testing contributed €312m revenue in Q3, i.e., 18% below our expectations. Thus, group sales came in 6% below our Q3 estimate. COVID-19 testing sales thus declined -26% q/q (vs. -10% SFe) and accounted for 37% of group sales in Q3, down from 44% in H1. As COVID-19 testing enjoys a higher profitability, a lower contribution led to a lower margin. Thus, the Q3 EBITDA margin stood at 28.9% (vs. 34.5% in H1 and vs. 32.0% SFe) and Q3 EBITDA came in 15% below our expectations. Core business in line with expectations: Underlying organic growth came in at 12.2% in Q3 (vs. 12.5% SFe). As expected, this was mostly driven by the ramp-up of the South-East London (SEL) hospital outsourcing contract (SFe: 9.5% out of the 12.2% underlying organic growth). We do not expect major changes to consensus revenue or EBITDA: The company guidance had already been lifted in October and is broadly in line with consensus. We also note that the implied Q4 EBITDA of >€92m is quite conservative and we do not expect consensus to adjust downward. Upside to consensus unlevered FCF: The group raised its unlevered FCF guidance (company definition) in October to €700m, implying at least 12% upside to the consensus estimate. We also note that this guidance could look conservative as the group already generated €630m unlevered FCF over 9M-21. New 2022 guidance is broadly in line with consensus: The group now guides for €2.9bn revenue in 2022 and 23-25% EBITDA margin (in line with consensus). At the IPO, Synlab indicated that it would generate €500m revenue from COVID-19 testing in 2022. It also raises its M&A spending guidance to above €200m (as in 2021E) thanks to the higher cash generation and deleveraging in 2021 (thanks to COVID-19 testing).

KGX GY,KGX,Oct 26 2021 02:07AM,KION,Industrials,"Results stronger, new record SCS orders, end-market surprise ","KION reported Q3 results: initial reaction positive. KION beats Q3 expectations onall metrics. Particular highlights are #1 the new record order intake of EUR 1.4bn (!) in warehouse automation and #2 a positive margin surprise in forklift trucks (in context of the heated cost inflation debate). Order intake guidance specified to the upper end of the range and European forklift truck end-market growth of 40% in Q3 (we expected 30%) should be equally well received. Buy strongly reiterated. KION is part of our three top picks for 2021, preferred over Jungheinrich (JUN3 GY, €42.98, Hold): we expect both KION’s higher share in IC-trucks and the nature of the exposure within warehouse automation (natural partner for larger e-commerce customers, regional focus US) to be more beneficial in 2021. We therefore consider both its relative valuation and absolute discount unjustified and unsustainable (KION trades on a c.25% discount on FY-23 EV/EBIT versus its five-year trailing average). ","Key points: #1 Q3 stronger on all metrics: Orders up 34% y/y (13% above consensus). Therein the surprise was driven by the SCS segment (warehouse automation) printing an order intake of EUR 1.4bn (!) that compares with a consensus of EUR 1.07bn. KION comment the verticals of e-commerce, food and textiles to have been particularly strong. Sales up 24% y/y (2% above consensus) with growth driven by both segments. EBIT adjusted up 44% y/y (c.7% above consensus). The absolute EBIT beat was mostly driven by the ITS segment (forklift trucks), and therein on less cost headwinds than anticipated (margin down only 30bps sequentially). #2 FY-21 guidance specified: KION guides for an order intake range of EUR 10.65-11.45bn (mid-point EUR 11.05bn). KION now expects order intake at both group and individual levels to be at the upper end of the range. For sales it guides for a range of EUR 9.7-10.3bn (mid-point EUR 10.0bn), EBIT adjusted EUR 810-890m (mid-point EUR 850m).

NEOEN FP,NEOEN,Nov 10 2021 01:00AM,NEOEN,Utilities,Revenues up by 16% in Q3-21; Management transparent in analyst call ,Main takeaways from the analyst call:,"""What does not kill you makes you stronger"": Management remained confident in their ability to navigate in this challenging environment, and acknowledged that supply chain issues and cost inflation will remain until at least the end of 2022. Once again, the CEO offered the opinion that competitors have been too aggressive in their business plans and that some of them could be out of the market in the near term, resulting in a less competitive environment in the near to long term. At least 50 bps hit on equity IRRs for 1 GW of capacity: Management provided useful update on the magnitude of their exposure to cost inflation. The Group now has 1 GW of projects exposed to cost inflation, versus 500 MW announced in the last call. The previously announced 50 bps hit on equity IRRs ""could be more"", according to management. Again, we like management's transparency on this topic, as Neoen is one of the few firms in the industry that provides precise figures on the value destruction on future projects. Despite being exposed, management indicates that not single project has been cancelled so far due to cost inflation. Update on regulatory environment in Mexico: Management admitted that the current local situation in Mexico is not so favorable for non-government companies like Neoen. Still, the tone remained confident, as management indicated that even if the regulation is adopted, the final impact would not be so damaging. Among other things, the CEO highlighted that their local solar project (El Llano) provides electricity to the government at less than $20/MWh versus current spot prices of around $60/MWh, and that around half of the electricity in the country is provided by non-government em oe ee we eee companles. Risk provision for the lawsuit in Australia to be recorded: Management also provided a useful update on the lawsuit from the Australian Energy Regulator. While the situation looks mostly under control, management admitted that a risk provision of limited amount was recorded in Q3-21, and that the money that was over-received due to the technical issue has been fully reimbursed. >3.2 GW in operation by end-21 and >4.25 GW by end-22 : Managementhinted that around 3.2-3.3 GW could be fully operational by year-end, and that around 85-90% of the 5 GW in operation or under construction by year-end should be operational by end-2022, implying at least 4.25 GW. An overall good quarter of revenues: Revenues up by 16%: total revenues in Q3-21 rose by 16% to €77.7m. Solar revenues declined by 3% mainly due to low irradiation levels in Europe and in Australia in the quarter, which did not fully offset the higher contribution from early-generation revenues at El Llano in Mexico. Onshore wind revenues grew by 13% mainly driven by new capacity in 2020 (Finland, France) and in Q3-21 (France), partly offset by low wind levels in Europe in Q3-21. Storage revenues benefited from new capacity (Finland, Australia) and from the non-recurrence of a negative one-off in Q3-20. Overview of targets: Guidance 2021 is confirmed: the Group confirmed its target of 5 GW in operation or under construction. It stood at 4.8 GW as of September 30. It also confirmed an EBITDA range of €295-310m and an EBITDA margin of around 80%. 5 GW fully operational during 2023 vs end-22: due to supply chain issues, especially regarding solar modules, the Group faced delays in the development of some projects and now expects 5 GW fully operational during 2023 versus at the end of 2022 as Neoen previously anticipated. Capacity target of more than 10 GW in operation or under construction by end-25 is confirmed. EBITDA guidance over 2022-2025 is confirmed: the Group targets EBITDA growth of at least 20% in 2022, and double-digit annual growth over 2023-2025.",Martin Tessier,Martin Tessier,52,,Buy,,EUR,0.28,,0.48,,0,0,,,,,M,STIFEL_Revenues up_FlashCoNote_Nov 10 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Revenues up_FlashCoNote_Nov 10 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=dc95f6e0-8477-44a1-9e2c-0485155354a4&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
SGO FP,SGO,Oct 22 2021 01:00AM,Compagnie de Saint Gobain,Building Materials,Reverse Normalisation vs Structural Upside ,"Saint Gobain benefited quite strongly from COVID-19 in terms of renovation activity.This together with the ISM is now starting to normalise, while inflationary pressures matter. Its Q3-21 sales should largely be a non-event, albeit it might provide further insight into future (2022) trends. e European exposure and its ESG credentials matter in context of value. The good news is that Saint Gobain has an important exposure to Europe, which is still below the pre- GFC highs and should benefit from the EU's Next Generation Recovery Plan. In addition, the Group sits in the value bucket with the other 'sin-bin' stocks. This seems unfair given its ESG credentials (see attached assessment). e With the CMD behind us, the question is what's the upside from here in terms of returns? We are hopeful, but reality is, margins are close to the top end of the range also against its peers, while the ROCE upside won't be delivered immediately. e In short, we would expect the stock to linger or fall back in the near term, also relative to the sector. That said, the current slowdown reminds us of the 2003/04 deceleration, which was short-lived. We raise our PT to €63 (from €56), but maintain our Hold rating. ","Q3-21 Sales - More Insight Into Future (2022) Trends? The Group already updated the market with regard to its Q3-21 volume and price trends (+1% and +8%, respectively) and higher input costs. In that sense, we see the Q3-21 update as a means to better understand where the normalisation trends and the industrial cycle are going into 2022. When looking at our Google Searches for French renovation, DIY vs flights, it appears as if the former two are slowing, while the latter is moving back up again (see Figure 2). Momentum in the ISM (see Figure 1) has also slowed and looks like it could struggle to rebound in the near term. The Group should feel the impact of the chips shortage and Chinese demand slowing in its mobility and industrial businesses. That said, Oct-21 seems to have been a strong month for renovation again. Also, the data out of the US remains strong, especially in housing-related building materials (see Figure 3), bar the energy impact. Overall, we would not be surprised for the current slowing to resemble what happened in 2003/04. What's The Upside From Here? Some Further Qualitative Thoughts Where we see significant upside is the absolute level of output in Western Europe representing ~65% of sales (see Figure 4). French renovation, in particular, is still some -10% below its 2007 peak. With the EU's Next Generation Recovery Plan under way, this is where we are most optimistic for the Group. We should see a pronounced effect from Q2-22 onwards. More importantly, we believe that the Group's ESG credentials are far from recognised. In our view, it doesn't make sense for the stock to correlate negatively with the COz price, while being in the value camp. In that sense, it has the potential to re-rate, while the highly rated 'ESG and growth darlings' may de-rate in line with the value-into-growth rotation. Valuation Upside Largely Depends On Sustainable Higher Returns Future upside and re-rating potential really depends on delivering on the Group's new ROCE target range of 12-15%. Currently, the stock trades on 1.2x EV/CE 21E, which sort of tallies with our ROCE estimate of 10% 21E. In 2007, this valuation yardstick was at 1.4x vs an ROCE of 11.5%. When looking at its margins vs targets (9-11%), history and its peers, there seems limited upside (see Figures 8 & 9). But that doesn't mean more can't be possible given the right strategic and operational execution.",Tobias Woerner,Tobias Woerner,63,56,Hold,,EUR,5.14,,5.3,,2.05,2.12,,,,,M,STIFEL_Reverse Normalisation_CoNote_Oct 22 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Reverse Normalisation_CoNote_Oct 22 2021 01-00AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=69a3a5b3-557d-4bac-943f-9bd6894048bb&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
INS GR,INS,Nov 18 2021 01:50AM,Instone Real Estate Group,Real Estate,Revised 2021 and first time 2022 guidance entails potential for disappointment ,"Instone has provided first time earnings guidance for 2022 of adjusted earningsafter tax (EAT) of €90-€100m (Stifel: €119.1m) which is likely to disappoint the market in our view. There is no consensus available, but we understand that more recent published estimates were ~10% higher. 2022 adjusted revenue outlook of €0.9-€1.0bn (Stifel: €1.1bn) is also below previous indications of >€1.0bn. On the positive side, gross profit margins of c28% are above previous guidance (26-27%) for 2021 and have enabled the company to upgrade its 2021 EAT guidance to €93-€96m (Stifel: €92.3m) from €90-€95m previously. Instone has also grown its portfolio strongly during the quarter, from €6.3bn at H121 to GDV of €7.2bn at 9M21. ","Retail sales ratio remained well above long-term average in Q321, indicating unbroken demand. Concluded sales contracts of €378m at 9M21 are expected to result in sales of >€1,000bn at FY21E, up from previous guidance of €900m. e@ Q3-21 Gross (30.5% vs. 29.4% in H121) and EBIT (16.7% vs. 15.8% in H1-21) adj. margins were both ahead of the half way stage and the company has revised upwards its gross profit margin outlook for 2021 to ~28% from 26%-27% previously. Adjusted EAT guidance has also been upgraded from €90-€95m to €93-€96m (Stifel: €92.3m). Raw material costs and bottlenecks. The company has stated that supply chain bottlenecks remain a management focus and that the delays in building permits for selected projects and construction progress have adversely affected revenue in 2021. Adjusted revenue in 2021 is expected to be €780-€800m compared to €820-€900m previously. The outlook for 2022 of €900-€1,000m is also below previous indications of >€1,000m. Cash flow and balance sheet. Operating cash flow of -€39m in Q321, reflects land purchases of €64.4m. Consequently, Net debt/EBITDA and LTC are at higher levels again (1.6x vs. 1.3x in H1-21 and 15.6% vs. 12.5% in H121). Instone had €203m in corporate and €197m in project financing liquidity at 9M21. GDV: Significant new projects approvals worth €799m in Q321 (618m in H121) helped the project portfolio grow to €7.2bn at 9M21 (and currently) vs €6.3bn in H121. Prospective Net Asset Value per share is up significantly at €37.87 (vs. €33.12 in H121) driven by the step up of the project pipeline during the quarter. e@ View: Today's numbers confirm that the company is not immune to the delays facing developers in Germany and the 2022 outlook is likely to disappoint. Encouragingly margins remain strong and house price inflation momentum is more than offsetting rising material costs (inc. transportation) which remain the key cost driver. The press release refers to a step change in growth for Instone over the next few years, and how the company intends to further expand its project portfolio.",Pascal Boll,Pascal Boll;Tom Carstairs,36,,Buy,,EUR,0.95,,1.96,,0.26,0.6,,,,,M,STIFEL_Revised 2021_FlashCoNote_Nov 18 2021 01-50AM.pdf,STIFEL_Revised 2021_FlashCoNote_Nov 18 2021 01-50AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=ece85c5d-a6fa-4787-bfa0-3868d2a898a2&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
KNIN SW,KNIN,Dec 14 2021 06:11AM,Kuhne + Nagel,Transportation,Rising tide lifts all container vessels - up to Buy ,"We upgrade K+N to Buy from Hold as the share price has dipped significantly belowour target price for reasons that we deem to be unjustified. Also, the price decline puts K+N on pre-pandemic multiples, which we think is unwarranted as we doubt we will return to a pre-pandemic environment. e The decline was triggered at the end of September by reports that spot ocean freight rates had dropped by 50% and prolonged by reports that Maersk will cut off freight forwarders. e Instead, we believe that freight rates will remain higher for longer and large forwarders like K+N are in a good position to expand their share of wallet vs. small freight forwarders and in-house logistics. e@ Subsequently, we are 6% and 9% ahead of consensus EBIT estimates for FY21 and FY22, respectively. ","This note should be read in conjunction with our sector note - European Logistics: No such thing as ""pre-crisis"" margins Upgrade to Buy from Hold: K+N has suffered the largest fall from peak share price levels in our coverage since the start of the fourth quarter. We upgrade our recommendation to Buy from Hold as our price target is now significantly above the current level, and there is no compelling reason to reduce our estimates. As detailed in our sector note, we believe that the notion that spot ocean freight rates have fallen significantly since September is misguided, as it primarily relies on Freightos' assessment, which is skewed by the inclusion of premium rates that are of little relevance to the overall market. In addition, we believe that Maersk's alleged move to restrict access to capacity is aimed at small forwarders, which will ultimately benefit larger ones (K+N is easily the largest ocean forwarder). Thus, we believe the current share price level is an attractive entry point to benefit from an anticipated rebound once the market realises that freight rates will stay higher for longer. Earnings outlook: We slightly raise our FY21 estimates to account for the better-than-expected freight rate environment in air and sea in the fourth quarter. At FY21 EBIT of CHF2.6bn, we are now ~6% ahead of FY21 consensus EBIT estimates and as we only expect a slight dip in profitability in FY22 to CHF2.5bn, we are ~9% ahead of FY22 EBIT estimates of CHF2.3bn. Crucially, FY22 consensus EBIT estimates go as low as CHF1.6bn, which reflects the bearish sentiment on K+N that, in our view, would have only made sense if freight rates had already dropped significantly. Instead, we are about to enter FY22 close to peak levels in air and sea freight rates. Valuation: On our estimates, K+N trades at ~16x FY23e EV/EBIT (or 18x consensus FY23e EV/EBIT), which is roughly in line with the historical average 2-year forward EV/EBIT multiple. We believe K+N should trade at a premium to its pre-pandemic valuation (to the average at least) as ocean freight rates shouldn't return to pre-pandemic levels and in addition the pandemic opened further revenue and profitability growth opportunities as detailed in the sector note. Here, we believe that the pandemic-induced change from Just-in-Time to Just-in-Case supply chain management increases complexity, which helps gross margins and drives market share gains for forwarders vs. in-house logistic operations. Ultimately, we expect K+N's adj. EBIT (ex- Apex) will normalise at CHF1.9bn in FY24e, roughly 30% ahead of the pre-pandemic growth trend.",Marc Zeck,"Marc Zeck, CFA;Johannes Braun, CFA, CIIA",325,,Buy , Hold ,CHF,15.7,,14.7,,10.3,9.24,,,,,M,STIFEL_Rising tide_CoNote_Dec 14 2021 06-11AM.pdf,STIFEL_Rising tide_CoNote_Dec 14 2021 06-11AM,RATINGS CHANGE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=cdddf362-5545-4152-9eba-0ccc084b415f&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
BNR GY,BNR,Dec 03 2021 01:00AM,Brenntag SE,Chemicals,Roadshow feedback ,"We hosted Brenntag's CFO, Georg Miller, and SVP Investor Relations, ThomasAltmann for a continental Europe roadshow. We list below the key takeaways from the roadshow: ","Market conditions: The CFO highlighted that the market continues to be characterized by supply chain disruptions and product unavailability, with no indication of normalisation. For Brenntag, as a large distributor, this offers an opportunity to outshine the smaller players due to its ability to overcome/mitigate shortages, in our view. In this environment there is hardly any price elasticity as availability and reliability become the key buying criteria. Dynamics into 2022: We are reminded that Brenntag in its 20-25 years of financial history has not had a single year of gross profit decline (except a minor decline during the financial crisis). As gross profit per unit and volumes offset each other, gross profit stays on a growth trajectory. With the disclaimer of the current situation being uncharted territory, Brenntag remains cautiously optimistic of growing its gross profit and EBITDA in 2022 not least due to the contribution of Project Brenntag. Brenntag believes that the gross profit per unit, while not sustainable at the current level, should still stay at a higher than pre-pandemic level as customers understand and value the reliable and timely procurement capabilities of a large distributor. Project Brenntag update: The transformation project should have delivered almost half of the cost savings (€100-110m) by the end of 2021 (9M-21: €70m since base year 2019). Therefore, we think there is more to come in 2022. The other aspect of the project, which pertains to the divisional split into Essentials and Specialties, is also proving to be value accretive as the specialties business gets more recognition from suppliers and customers alike. M&A strategy: Geographically, Brenntag wants to increase its market share in Asia and feels confident about its market understanding after being present in the region for >10 years. Specialties also remains a focus for the company, demonstrated by its acquisitions in 2021, that were predominantly in the specialties business. However, Essentials also remains an attractive market in terms of M&A due to more reasonable multiples and growth opportunities. FCF and firepower: As a distributor, chemical prices are the key swing factor in the net working capital that affects FCF in a counter-cyclical way. However, due to Project Brenntag's focus on working capital management, we argue the improvement in working capital turnover should be sustainable. This translates to c. €150-200m of FCF. The company wants to maintain its investment grade rating and hence can leverage up to 2.5x (currently c. 1.5x) in case of attractive M&A opportunities. Digitalization and ESG: Brenntag is making progress in regard to digitalization in terms of service offering (c. €300m annualized revenue) and data analytics. However, there is still scope for digitalization of processes. The company takes this and ESG seriously and is working on developing a road map for both these topics.",Isha Sharma,Isha Sharma;Andreas Heine,90,,Buy,,EUR,4.46,,4.41,,1.4,1.45,,,,,M,STIFEL_Roadshow feedback_FlashCoNote_Dec 03 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Roadshow feedback_FlashCoNote_Dec 03 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=65afcc9a-10a6-4123-95a9-2bebd32db9ed&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
NEOEN FP,NEOEN,Dec 02 2021 01:00AM,NEOEN,Utilities,Second farm-down: value creation competencies again demonstrated ,"Conclusion: Neoen's second disposal shows (again) their ability to develop highlyvaluable assets, which we deem as one of the best in Europe. The transaction indicates an EV/MW of €1.3m, at the high-end of what can be seen for operational PV assets in Europe. Capital gain of €9m is expected. Transaction multiple should not be compared with the one from the first disposal made in September (EV/MW of €2.8m), as solar modules of the two transactions rely on different technologies. Another disposal should be announced by year-end, most likely in onshore wind. ","Neoen's second farm-down: Neoen announced it will sell its entire interest in two solar projects in France for a total capacity of 21.7 MW to an undisclosed buyer. This is the second farm-down executed by the company since management informed the market, in March during the CMD, about their intention to engage in asset disposals to partly finance their growth plan to 2025. Transaction is expected to close by the end of the year. Attractive deal financials: enterprise value of the portfolio stands close to €29m, implying an EV/MW multiple of €1.3m, resulting in a net capital gain of around €9m. We deem financials attractive, as recent transactions for operational solar assets in Europe indicate EV/MW multiples of €0.9-1.3m on average. EV/MW should not be compared with multiple of first transaction: in September, Neoen announced its first disposal ever (First farm-down shows Neoen's value creation competencies), consisting in the sale of two solar projects. The firm locked an extremely high (for solar assets) EV/MW of €2.8m, as projects were partly made of concentrator PV modules, a more efficient (and more expensive) technology than classic crystalline PV modules. Indeed, average yield of assets sold in September stands 19% above the one of the assets disposed yesterday. High price brings light on Neoen’s value creation competencies: this transaction strengthens our belief that Neoen ranks among the best-in-class European developers and operators of renewables assets. While development is the most risky phase in a project lifetime, it’s also the most value creative. This is even more true in France, where the highest value creation is found on projects for which the location has been selected by the developer itself (Neoen is very active on this type of asset), in opposition to projects developed on pre-determined locations in government tenders. We think this ability to develop highly valuable projects is an attractive hedge to the current environment of cost inflation. No impact on EBITDA guidance: net capital gain of €9m will be recognized in 2021 EBITDA, commensurate with the firm’s EBITDA guidance constituents: 1) the volume of projects sold will not exceed 20% of the gross annual growth of the secured portfolio, and 2) the contribution of capital gains to consolidated full-year EBITDA will be less than 20%. Thus, Neoen reiterates its EBITDA guidance for 2021 of €295-310m. YTD, total capital gains stand at €19m, or 6% of the mid-point of the EBITDA guidance. One additional disposal expected by year-end: Neoen indicates that an additional disposal should be announced by year-end. Based on the firm's EBITDA guidance, a maximum of €41.5m further capital gains can be realized by year-end. As indicated by management during last earnings call, we believe the deal could refer to an onshore wind project in France. Description of assets sold: both projects are located in France, in Lugos (Gironde) and Miremont (Haute-Garonne). Assets were commissioned in June 2018 and July 2019, respectively. They were awarded under the CRE 3 (Commission de Régulation de l’Energie) government call for tenders in 2018, and benefit from PPAs running until 2038 at €97/MWh and until 2039 at €90/MWh, respectively.",Martin Tessier,Martin Tessier,48,,Buy,,EUR,0.25,,0.38,,0,0,,,,,M,STIFEL_Second farm-down-_FlashCoNote_Dec 02 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Second farm-down-_FlashCoNote_Dec 02 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=23d34e21-e1cf-448b-959c-085009f226da&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

DOKA SW,DOKA,Nov 19 2021 01:00AM,dormakaba,Capital Goods,"Short-term pain, long-term gain ","We believe that dormakaba's recent CMD with the new management teamhas generally increased investors’ confidence in the company's ability to reach the targeted 16-18% EBITDA margin range, which nonetheless comes in combination with various upfront costs. e Further consensus cuts are still needed, in our view - apart from recent M&A announcements we hardly changed our top-line assumptions but implemented further rising IT harmonization investments for the coming years and also reflected its announced CHF 25m restructuring costs. On a reported level this reduced our 21/22E & 22/23E EBITDA expectations by -17% & -5%, respectively, while we increased our long-term EBITDA margin expectation from 16.5% to 17.0%. e Supported by higher long-term expectations we are raising our price target from CHF 640 to CHF 750. Now trading slightly above the Swiss Industrials average, we think sufficient upside potential can still be found, but only in the mid- term. Our attached ESG analysis currently does not indicate any major tailwind, while we believe the company gradually still has to show 1) a higher structural- growth-like top-line track-record, 2) an improved M&A integration capability and 3) improved free cash flow generation, more in line with sector peers. ","Structural growth component besides M&A deals still hardly visible Dormakaba's newly provided ambition to grow sales organically by 3-5% p.a. looks strong in comparison to its much lower five-year average of only 0.5%. However, we highlight that its old targets were indirectly also looking for comparable levels and that this year's 3-5% projection also seems to include a considerable 3% pricing impact. Accordingly, a significant structural growth component is not yet really visible, in our view. Rising confidence to see higher profitability levels in the mid-term We would generally rather stress relatively strong margin improvement ambitions following initial growth investments. As shown in the attachment, its 16-18% EBITDA margin target should partly benefit from still surprisingly low-hanging fruitme in areas such as procurement, where the company historically progressed much slower than always anticipated (hardly-consolidated supplier basis still seen around 25k). The planned Mesker disposal does not yet seem to be included in the calculation (SFe margin impact around 30-40bp from FY'22/23 onwards) and it surprisingly also does not yet reflect benefits from a realigned production footprint, as typically seen at its biggest peer. Its ROCE target of >30% by FY'23/24 looks achievable, in our view, but only when neglecting the whole goodwill poairion (excluding Dorma's goodwill part we are still calculating a much lower pre-tax ROCE figure of 16.5%). Comprehensive ESG assessment reveals a mixed first picture (E=/S+/G-) It is positive to see the recent data progress and target-setting on the environmental level, but we are stressing that Scope 1+2 emission data are currently not better than those of the Swiss Industrials average and the company's largest sector peer. Apart from some automatic door systems, we are generally seeing a limited green exposure on group level. In our view, the social picture already looks much better when it comes to aspects such as diversity and social megatrends. Corporate Governance still represents an area of concern for many investors. Here, we do not get the impression that critical aspects such as the BOD independence or ownership structures will change anytime soon. Furthermore, we believe that many investors do not really like to see the recent financial reporting / transparency changes in the area of profit adjustments, as they often generally seem to belong to the business model.",Tobias Fahrenholz,Tobias Fahrenholz,750,640,Hold,,CHF,30.3,,30.9,,12.5,14.5,,,,,M,"STIFEL_Short-term pain,_CoNote_Nov 19 2021 01-00AM.pdf","STIFEL_Short-term pain,_CoNote_Nov 19 2021 01-00AM",EVENT FEEDBACK,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=b5a1f3aa-68d8-4fb3-8c05-9a11a8caa1ef&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
FACC AV,FACC,Nov 16 2021 02:13AM,FACC AG,Aerospace & Defence,Slight Turbulence During Climb ,"We update our financial model for FACC (rated Hold) following 9M-21 resultsand our discussions with the company. We cut EPS estimates for FY-21 (due to a charge relating to an arbitration award) and FY-22 (due to margins at Cabin Interiors), and reduce our PT by 6% to €8.50 PT (implying a +1% TSR). We also include an ESG Assessment in this note. e@ Overall, we view the 9M-21 results (and the prior day's news of a charge of ~€30m due to an adverse arbitration award) as being slightly mixed. They featured EBIT and revenues that hit consensus and our estimates, a moderate Free Cashflow (""FCF"") beat vs our estimate, and initial FY-22 guidance that was in line with consensus (though below our estimate, with less revenue upside from higher production rates and lower benefit from operating leverage and 787 contract re-pricing than we had anticipated). The arbitration award, whilst dating to contracts signed in 2009-2011, is a surprise, and, we forecast, a significant subtraction to FCF next year. e The results are a small setback for our thesis that FACC, like other Civil Aero. suppliers, has the potential to be a revenue, margin and cashflow recovery story. What continues to hold our view back is a combination of relatively high leverage, an earnings and cashflow recovery that appears to be slower than we had expected (partly due to the dragging pace of the wide-body recovery), and that FACC's near-term trading multiples are somewhat high amongst European A&D. e@ In 2021 YTD, FACC shares are down 1%, vs +40% for the ATX index, and +16% for the European A&D Sector (as measured by the Stoxx A&D index). FACC is generally trading in the top 5 stocks of European A&D on any trading multiple beyond FY-21 and is high vs its history, which we see as justified by very strong potential EPS and cashflow recovery from a depressed FY-20 base level. ","EPS Estimates Cut Our reported EPS estimates are €-0.60 (2021E, down non-meaningfully vs. €-0.05 previously) and €0.20 (2022E, down 33% vs. €0.30 previously). The cuts are mainly due to a €30m charge in FY-21 for an arbitration award, and to lower Cabin Interiors margins. These estimates are below current I/B/E/S median consensus of €-0.02 and €0.23, respectively, although we believe that consensus is not factoring in the arbitration award, and the percentage difference in EPS is magnified due to the base effect of low absolute EPS levels — at EBIT level, the difference vs consensus is only €-31m in FY-21 and €-3m in FY-22. Price Target Lowered Our new PT is €8.50 (down 6% vs €9.00 previously), due to a lower FY-23 EPS estimate, partly offset by a higher target P/E Relative. Our PT of €8.50 implies that in one year's time, FACC shares trade at 17x FY-23E EPS, which, whilst it implies significant multiple contraction vs their current Forecast Year 2 multiple of 41x FY-22E EPS, is still well above their post-IPO mean (to 18 Jun 2020, for the reason mentioned above) of 13x. Valuation and Next Event FACC shares trade at 41x 2022E EPS, and 17x 2023E EPS (vs the Euro Civil Aero mean of 29x / 19x), which compares with their post-IPO (six-year period to June 2020) mean of 13x Forecast Year 2 EPS. On EV/FCF, they trade at a non-meaningful 2022E multiple (due to negative FCF), falling to 23x 2023E (vs. peers at 33x / 22x).

STLA IM,STLA,Dec 08 2021 01:00AM,Stellantis N.V.,Automotive,Software-derived services: €20bn optionality ,CMD date finally announced: 1 March 2022,"Reasonably positive. Announcements were within reasonable expectations and a fraction of future business should be more recurring with accretive margins. A good catch up exercise from a legacy manufacturer with management enjoying a solid track record in executing plans (on both cost and pricing management). Stellantis contemplates €20bn from software-derived services by 2030 €4bn of software-based revenues by 2024; rising to €20bn in 2030 (vs €0.4bn currently). Stellantis assumptions are based on expected 34m monetisable connected cars on the road in 2030 (the majority of which should be fully OTA updatable) vs 12m today. Back of the envelope calculation suggests that new businesses could account for c.7% of STLA's revenues in 2030 and possibly 15% of the profit pool assuming that pricing discipline still prevails. Five different revenue streams targeted: 1/ Services & subscriptions (inc. entertainment, nav w/ live traffic/travel info etc..), 2/ Features on demand (one-time or monthly), 3/ Data-as-a-service (ex: ""usage-based insurance""), 4/ Vehicle pricing/ Resale-value, and 5/ Conquest services and cross-selling. Rationale and business mix trends. Customers are expected to increasingly ""enhance and update their car"" throughout the entire ownership and not just at the time of the purchase. This is thanks to connectivity and software capabilities. Going forward, the features and subscription services - aka the recurring portion - should be a growing function of the number of monetised connected vehicles on the road. However, until 2026, c. 50% of the software-based services should still be derived from better pricing (at purchase) and accordingly increased resale-value (from enhanced vehicles). Among other technicalities, Stellantis should deploy three Al-powered technology platforms (STLA Brain, STLA Cockpit and STLA Auto Drive) across their four physical EV platforms (Small/Medium/Large/Frame) through 2024. The new developments should be carried out in-house or through dedicated partnerships (Foxcon, BMW or Waymo). Key takeaways from the call New businesses should enjoy a more ""tech-like"" margin drop-through. CFO hinted at profitability being significantly accretive to the confirmed ""double-digit"" one for core business. Capital devoted to software development should account for 15%/20% of planned €30bn capex through 2025 for both EV and Software; that's €1bn+ per annum which the group claim to be +30% more efficient than at its competition. Plan for China re-boot is progressing well and should be detailed during CMD (CEO cryptically referred to possible further announcements as certain ""regulatory hurdles"" are lifted beginning of 2022).",Pierre-Yves Quéméner,Pierre-Yves Quémeéner;Daniel Schwarz,24,,Buy,,EUR,3.67,,4.22,,0.94,1.31,,,,,M,STIFEL_Software-derived services-_FlashCoNote_Dec 08 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Software-derived services-_FlashCoNote_Dec 08 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=f0d3d55d-321e-4dab-adc6-33d5e015a5df&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
NEXI IM,NEXI,Nov 11 2021 04:21PM,Nexi SpA,Payment Services,Solid 3Q21 suggests a sustained recovery ,"3Q21 provided another set of solid quarterly figures, after 1Q and 2Q,confirming a continued recovery in acquiring sales volumes, especially in Italy which saw transaction volumes improve by c.20% on 2019 levels. Elsewhere volumes in the Nordics were above 2019 levels, while the DACH volumes (Germany in particular) was still below 2019 levels due to a lack of recovery in business travel. Lastly, 3Q EBITDA margin remained solid, at 53.9%, with the margin dilution from the Nets acquisition partly compensated by the improving top-line and focus on costs (which were flattish ex. variable costs). e The Nets (consolidated from 3Q21) and SIA (expected to be completed by FY21 year-end) acquisitions should transform Nexi from domestic Italian payments vendors to a pan-European payments leader with operations in >25 countries. We remain optimistic on the medium-term earnings growth at Nexi (2020—2023E rev / EPS CAGR of 53% / 22%). However, our optimism on the growth story at Nexi is balanced by the time lag in seeing the first synergy benefits and the near- term headwinds from increased competition of 'Unified Commerce’ payment vendors. We retain our Hold / €20 PT on Nexi. ","Improving transaction volumes and Merchant Services momentum Growth momentum continued to remain robust in 3Q21 with revenues up 10.1% y/y on like-for-like basis (vs. +22.6% in 2Q21 on very easy comps and +4.1% in 1Q21). This was driven by a sustained underlying recovery in acquiring sales volumes, which were up c.20% on 2019 levels for card transactions in 3Q, while DACH volumes continued to remain jaded by weaker (largely business) travel. Elsewhere, e-commerce also showed continued strength with transaction volumes up 37% y/y in 3Q21 (+35% in 1Q20). We expect transaction volumes and consequently underlying Merchant Services momentum to improve in 4Q and FY22. SIA acquisition expected to close by the end of FY21 The closing of the SIA acquisition has been delayed by a couple of months and is now expected by FY21 year-end. Nexi has already received the approval from the Italian Competition and Danish regulatory authorities. Management expects BAFIN and the Italian Stock Exchange prospectus approvals in the coming weeks and opined that Nexi would consolidate SIA financials from January 1, 2022. FY21 guidance retained, remains achievable Management retained its FY21 guidance at (1) c.10% revenue growth; (2) 11-13% EBITDA growth, with EBITDA margin up 1% point (3% point from FY19 levels) ; (3) broadly stable Capex intensity. Given the 9.6% y/y growth seen in 9M21 and the management commentary of accelerating Merchant Services growth (60% of group revs and +12.2% y/y growth in 3Q), we believe FY21 guidance remains achievable. Valuation and catalysts Nexi is due to report its 4Q21 results in February 2022.

Management again slightly raised FY21 targets that look within reach. @ Stellest lens developments in China are highly encouraging after Essilor managed to turn this low-margin prescription category into a growth driver for the company. e@ 2021-23 EPS estimates raised by 5% on average and our PT to €200 (vs. €190). ,"Solid HSD sales growth, no deceleration in current trading After a slow start to the year with 1Q21 sales up 2% on a 2Y-stack (CER) triggered by EMEA down 7%, EL's growth (2Y-stack) accelerated to 9.2% in 2Q21 driven by North America (+16%) and Europe swinging to positive territory (+4%). The 9.0% 2Y-stack growth reached in 3Q21 beats SFe: +6.3%, cons. +7%e. North America remained strong (+14%) while EMEA further accelerated to +7%. Conversely, Asia-Pacific deteriorated (-7%) driven by Covid-19 related lockdowns. Current trading (October) is consistent with 3Q21 trends. FY21 top line guidance was raised from +MSD to +MSD-to-HSD on a 2Y- stack at CER (9m: +6.8%). Product-mix and merger synergies boding well for margin expansion Decline in store traffic continued, offset by higher conversion rates and average baskets as opticians have more time to explain the benefits of high-end lenses. Essilor's flagship brands such as Varilux, Crizal, Transitions and Eyezen have behaved well again in 3Q21, boding well for full-year margins. Solid and qualitative top-line growth has led management to raise its adjusted EBIT margin guidance from ""higher than 2019"" to ""up- to-100bp progress"" compared to 2019 at constant-excahnge rates (CER). After strong 2Q21 and 3Q21 quarters characterized by 9% top-line growth, with current trading holding at similar levels, and with incremental synergies between Essilor and Luxottica also helping (management confirmed all previous synergy targets between Essilor and Luxottica), we see limited risk to this new guidance. GrandVision (GV) adding fuel to our constructive case EL's FY21 outlook excludes GV. But 3Q21 also compared favourably with 3Q19 at GV, both on top line and margin. GV separately reported Thursday evening 2Y-stack sales growth of 10.0% in 3Q21 versus 3Q19 at CER - when excluding the disposed businesses (to comply with EU anti-trust). GV's adj. EBIT margin of 15.6% in 3Q21 was 300bp above 3Q19's 12.6%, also a trigger for the new EL (that has consolidated GV from 1st July 2021). Capital Market Day confirmed, no date yet Given all the developments underway at EL, a CMD would be most welcome, in our opinion. Investors probably would like to get more clarity on merger achievements so far and on what still needs to be done. With GV adding a new leg to the equity story, we would expect a strategic business plan as well as detailed synergy objectives to be detailed. Management confirmed a CMD with no timing yet. We would expect it to take place in 1H22 after the FY21 earnings report. EPS upped 5%, PT raised to €200 (vs. €190) Top-line beat and raised margin guidance led us to raise our 2021-23 EPS estimates by 5% on average.

ACE IM,ACE,Nov 10 2021 01:18PM,Acea,Utilities,Solid low-risk growth continued in Q3-21 ,"Acea's Q3-21 results confirmed the high single-digit positive trend in EBITDAreported in the previous quarters. EBITDA increased by 7% y/y, in line with our estimate and consensus. Net profit improved by 11%, better than our forecast. All businesses contributed to growth except the supply division, which was affected by negative one-offs. The main growth drivers were represented by the energy infrastructure division (mainly thanks to the positive impact on hydro margins from high power prices in the Italian market), and the water business (thanks to tariff increases linked to accelerating investments and cost efficiency). Net debt rose by 13% versus end 2020, mainly due to dividend payments in the period, capex acceleration and seasonal working capital evolution. The company confirmed the guidance for FY-21 (EBITDA growth >8%, capex €0.9bn, net debt €3.85-3.95bn). In our view, Acea represents a value creation story mainly based on investment opportunities in its regulated businesses (water and electricity distribution). According to our estimates, the company offers 6% average yearly growth potential in EBITDA in 2020-24. Visibility on such growth is, in our opinion, very high when considering the low risk of Acea's business portfolio and the strong delivery of Acea's management. Acea trades at lower multiples versus the other Italian local utilities and at a large discount versus fully regulated utilities. ","Detailed Q3-21 results are as follows: EBITDA increased by 7% y/y to €311m, in line with our €314m estimate. It confirmed the high single-digit growth reported in the previous quarters. All businesses posted positive evolution except the supply division, which was affected by negative one-offs. The main growth drivers were represented by 1) the energy infrastructure division (EBITDA +12% y/y to €112m), which benefited from RAB evolution in the electricity distribution business and strong hydropower generation margins due to high power prices in the Italian market and 2) the water business (EBITDA +6% y/y to €163m), mainly due to tariff increases linked to accelerating investments and cost efficiencies. The waste business (EBITDA +36% y/y to €18m) benefited from the consolidation of the treatment companies acquired in the past quarters, increasing treated volumes and higher achieved power prices for the WTE plants. EBITDA from the trading & supply business declined by 21% y/y to €16m. It was penalized by some negative one-offs, net of which it would have been flat versus Q3-20. e@ Net profit increased by 11% y/y to €83m (higher than our €79m estimate). Growth at the EBITDA level was only partially offset at the bottom line by higher DD&As linked to capex acceleration. Declining cost of debt also contributed to bottom-line growth. Investments slightly declined versus Q3-20 (to €202m). Nevertheless, in 9M-21 they increased 9% y/y. The company confirmed prior guidance of €0.9bn capex in FY-21, in line with 2020. Net debt increased by 13% versus end 2020 to €4.0bn, mainly due to dividend payments in the period, capex acceleration and seasonal working capital evolution. Surging energy prices had a moderate negative impact on working capital in the quarter. This effect is expected to be partially recovered by end 2021. Acea's management confirmed guidance for 2021: 1) EBITDA growth in excess of 8%, 2) investments at €0.9bn, 3) net debt €3.85-3.95bn.

VER AV,VER,Nov 04 2021 04:11AM,Verbund,Utilities,Solid Q3-21 ,"Conclusion: Verbund posted a solid set of Q3-21 results, with EBITDA up by 41% in thequarter (+31% excluding GCA). The Hydro segment was the main driver, mainly driven by higher achieved power prices. Based on the respective mid-points, EBITDA and adjusted Group Result guidances for FY-21 are raised by 13% and 23%, respectively, mainly driven by higher achieved power prices for the hydro segment as well as higher earnings expected in the Grid segment. ","Key KPls over 9M-21: EBITDA up by 16.3% to €1,151m (H1-21: +2.5%), EBIT up by 21.8% to €844m (H1-21: +5.5%) and Group Result up by 23% to €587m (H1-21: +4.5%). Net debt up to €2.78bn (H1-21: €2.6bn), implying 1.9x LTM EBITDA, mostly driven by the consolidation in H1-21 of ~ €650m net debt from GCA. Lower hydro generation in Q3-21: in Q3-21, hydro coefficient in Austria stood at 1.03 versus 1.05 in Q3-20. Over 9M-21, coefficient stands at 0.99 versus 0.98 over 9M-20, resulting in a 2.4% decrease of hydropower production to 23.68 TWh (H1-21: -3%). EBITDA from hydro: over 9M-21, EBITDA from hydro production stands at €842m, y/y increase of 18% (H1-21: stable). The slightly lower generation vs 9M-20 was offset by higher achieved power prices and higher flexibility products. The segment showed exceptional performance in Q3-21 with EBITDA up by 47%, mainly driven by higher achieved power prices. Hedging levels reflect rising power prices: the group has hedged 96/60/21 % of its production volumes for delivery in 2021/22/23 at a price of €51.6/62/60.9 per MWh. This compares with hedging levels in H1-21 of 88/47/13% at €47.3/56.3/55.1 per MWh. Marked-to-market prices as of 26 October reflect even more rising power prices, with hedged prices of €58/88.8/82.1 per MWh in 2021/22/23. e@ Weak Q3 in New Renewables: in Q3-21, the segment suffered from low generation from wind power (-19% vs long-term average) due to low wind speeds in Europe. Over 9M-21, production from wind power for the Group is down by 14%, of which -24% in Germany, -13% in Romania and -6% in Austria. As a result, EBITDA was only €2.4m in Q3-21 vs €8m in Q3-20, implying a 37% decrease over 9M-21 (H1-21: -30%). Grid segment (APG and GCA): EBITDA from grid is up by 17% to €197m (H1-21: +7%), of which €161m (-4% y/y) from APG and €36m from GCA (consolidated from 31 May 2021). Guidance of FY-21 EBITDA (IFRS) is increased from €170m to €210m at APG, and from €60m to €70m at GCA. Unchanged capex plan: capex plan for 2021-23 is unchanged at a total of €2.26bn, of which €1.37bn (60%) of growth capex and €0.88bn (40%) of maintenance capex. FY-21 outlook is raised: Verbund raises the mid-point of the EBITDA guidance range by 13%, which is now €1,490-1,590m, and raises the mid-point of the adjusted Group Result guidance range by 13%, which is now €720-790m.

TRN IM,TRN,Nov 10 2021 01:33PM,Terna,Utilities,"Solid Q3-21 growth, better than expected ","In Q3-21 Terna reported solid single-digit growth both at the top and the bottomline, better than our and consensus estimates. Revenues increased by 8% y/ y, EBITDA by 4%, net profit by 2%. Growth at the top line was mainly driven by regulated revenues, linked to RAB evolution. The increase in net profit was mainly driven by positive EBITDA evolution and declining interest charges. As we anticipated, Q3-21 capex remained flat y/y. Nevertheless, in 9M-21 investments grew by 23% y/y, consistent with the full-year target. Net debt increased by 4% versus end 2020, mainly due to capex acceleration, dividend payments in the period and increasing regulatory working capital. The 2021 interim dividend (to be paid at end of November) increased by 8% versus 2020, in line with Terna's dividend policy. ","Our Buy rating on Terna is mainly based on the high visibility offered by the company on the value-creation potential driven by energy transition and electrification of the economy. We think that such potential is only partially valued in Terna's current share price. We think that the current share price underestimates Terna's RAB growth in excess of 6% per year. Visibility has improved on the potential for the company to continue growing RAB at similar pace also beyond 2025 after the recent 25% increase in Terna's 2021-30 plan for the development of the electricity transmission grid. Detailed Q3-21 results are as follows: Revenues increased by 8% y/y to €643m. They were 2% higher than our €628m estimate. Regulated revenues grew by 6% y/y to €551m (estimate €541m), driven by RAB evolution. Non-regulated revenues increased by 20% y/y to €92m (estimate €87m). e@ Q3-21 EBITDA grew 4% versus Q3-20, at €463m (better than our €452m estimate). Growth at the top line was partially offset by cost increase. EBITDA growth was mainly driven by the regulated business (+4% y/y). Net profit improved by 2% y/y to €196m (6% higher than our €186m estimate). EBITDA growth and lower cost of debt were partially offset by higher DD&As (linked to capex acceleration) and higher tax rate than in Q3-20. Capex in the quarter remained flat y/y at €324m, as we anticipated. Nevertheless, in the 9M-21, investments increased by 23% y/y to €925m, consistent with the €1.4bn target for FY-21. Net debt increased by 4% versus end 2020 to €9.57bn.

Revenue stood at €1,755m, 1% above consensus, driven by organic growth which came in at 20.8% (vs. 19.7% cons.). We estimate that the two-years stacked organic growth adjusted for COVID-19 contracts slightly accelerated from +26% in H1 to +28% in Q3. We estimate that the beat and underlying acceleration were driven by the Specialized Services, for which organic growth stood at +20% (vs. +14% Visible Alpha cons.). The segment notably benefited from the beginning of recovery at TLS (the visa activity). Mgmt. confirmed that it had return to profitability and should be break-even over FY-21. We expect the trend to continue as travel is still significantly below 2019 levels, notably regarding Chinese tourism. The company indicated that the bidding process for the U.S. contracts were still ongoing, but one should not estimate a contribution to TLS's revenue before H2-22 (in line with our estimates). COVID-19 contracts in line in Q3, and should continue beyond. Excluding COVID-19 contracts, organic growth would have been +14-15% in Q3 (and +20% over 9M). We estimate that it implies c.€100m revenue from COVID-19 contracts in Q3, broadly in line with expectations in our view. Mgmt. noted during the call that they expected these contracts’ contribution to diminish, but continue in Q4 and beyond. The EU vaccination rates are already high, but booster shots and child vaccination should drive demand. We raise our Q4/FY-21E revenue by +3%/+1%. Mgmt. confirmed Q4 organic growth should be positive despite the tough comp base (+23% in Q4-20). We now include €50m revenue from COVID-19 contracts in Q4-21 (down -50% q/q). Thus, we now forecast +7.4% organic growth in Q4, up from +4.4% previously. Over FY-21E we now forecast +24% organic growth (vs. +23% previously). We thus expect the consensus of +22.6% to be revised upward as it implies only a low-single digit organic growth in Q4. Overall we raised our 2021 revenue by 1%, o/w 50% from higher underlying organic growth, and 50% from higher COVID-19 contracts estimates. We raise our 2021E EBITA estimate by 4%.

Mgmt. stated during the call that they did not expect a y/y margin contraction in H2 for the Core Services & DIBS segment despite the high comp base. And we expect TLS and Health Advocate to support the Specialized Services' margin. We have thus raised our EBITA margin estimate from 14.9% to 15.3%. We raise our 2022E revenue/EPS by c.3%. We forecast +3.1% organic growth in 2022E (up from +2.6% previously and vs. 5.7% consensus), due to the high comp base. We do not forecast any COVID-19 contract contribution at this stage.

SRG IM,SRG,Nov 04 2021 04:09AM,Snam,Utilities,Solid support to net profit from associates continued in Q3-21 ,Snam's Q3/9M-21 results were in line with our and consensus’ estimates at the,"EBITDA level, better at the bottom line. In Q3-21 revenues increased by 18% y/ y, mainly driven by an accelerating contribution from new businesses linked to energy transition and higher recovery of energy costs than in Q3-20. EBITDA reported a modest 1% y/y decline, mainly due to cost seasonality and still limited contribution from new businesses. Net profit increased by 3% versus Q3-20, supported by a higher-than-expected contribution from associates. Investments remained flat y/y in the quarter, but they increased by 14% in 9M, consistent with Snam's business plan. Net debt increased by 7% versus end 2020 (better than our estimate), mainly due to dividend payments in the period, capex acceleration and the acquisition of the stake in De Nora. Our Hold rating on Snam is mainly based on valuation. Snam trades at a 26% premium to RAB in 2021 declining to 21% in 2024. We think that those multiples are not demanding, but our valuation is in line with the current share price. We expect that strong support to the share price would derive from a fully visible dividend yield growing from 5.2% in 2021 to 5.8% in 2024. Detailed Q3-21 results are as follows: Revenues grew by 18% y/y to €807m. They were higher than our €749m estimate, mainly due to higher recovery of energy costs (which are a pass-through at EBITDA level). The main growth driver was represented by revenues from new businesses linked to energy transition, which more than doubled versus Q3-20 to €88m. Regulated revenues increased by 14% y/y to €711m. EBITDA declined by 1% y/y to €553m (in line with our €552m estimate). The modest tough comparison was mainly due to cost seasonality. New businesses linked to energy transition reported a negative EBITDA at -€4m, being in the ramp-up phase. Net profit increased by 3% y/y to €303m (4% higher than our €292m estimate). The slight decline in EBITDA and rising DD&As were offset by 1) lower interest charges, due to cost of debt reduction and 2) growing associates (€73m versus our €65m estimate), due to the contribution of De Nora, Adnoc and the startup of the TAP pipeline. Investments in the quarter remained flattish y/y (at €300m). In 9M-21 they increased by 14% to €866m, consistent with the FY-21 target. Net debt increased by 7% versus end 2020 to €13.8bn (versus our €14.05bn estimate), mainly due to dividend payments in the period, capex acceleration and the acquisition of the stake in De Nora. In January 2022 Snam will pay a €0.1048 interim dividend on 2021 results.

CRH ID,CRH,Nov 23 2021 02:58AM,CRH PLC,Construction,Standing Its Ground ,"CRH's Q3-21 trading statement this morning was as resilient and good as one could havehoped for, despite the higher input costs. The Group outperformed its peers in terms of margins, while guidance was raised usefully ahead of consensus for 2021. Trading seems to remain resilient, especially when it comes to pricing, while volumes remain supportive. Its US peers' share prices have already broken new highs, and we would expect CRH to follow. The Group remains in robust health with an extremely strong balance sheet allowing for further M&A, share buybacks and another higher dividend. As a matter of fact, the Group announced the continuation of its latest share buyback at the end of September, which underlines the value still on offer here. The shares should remain strong in the short-term, albeit we prefer Holcim (Buy, CHF46.39) with a view to the mid-term. ","Aresilient Q3-21, ahead of its peers in terms of margin performance. LFL sales and EBITDA increased +4% and +4% respectively for the quarter, putting the Group in line with the median performance of its global heavy-side peers at the EBITDA level (see Figure 2). Third quarter and nine-month EBITDA margins were ahead in all Divisions. Overall, margins increased +33bp to 21.8%, which was quite a surprise given the sharp and sudden rise in energy as well as other input costs. America Materials saw LFL sales and EBITDA increase by +4% and +4% respectively, driven by strong pricing in cement, aggregates and RMC (+5%, +4% and +4% respectively). Momentum appears good and more price increases are in the pipeline, helping to offset the impact from higher input costs. Europe Materials saw LFL sales and EBITDA increase by +6% and +7% respectively. The UK was a positive driver here, while France and Ireland benefited from easy comps. Building Products saw LFL sales and EBITDA increase by +1% and +2% respectively. The main driver of this performance was good pricing generally and strong housing markets in North America. Raising guidance ahead of consensus. The Group guides EBITDA in excess of USD5.25bn for the full-year (vs SFe and consensus at USD5,158m vs Visible Alpha at USD5,166m respectively), ~1.6% ahead of expectations. The Group also talks about further margin expansion for the full year. This is pretty impressive given that some other heavy-side companies have seen downgrades. At the end of the day, CRH should see at least +13% headline EBITDA growth in 2021, which is a more than respectable number yet again from this industry stalwart. For 2022, the Group talks about the impact of inflation, but also the encouraging news of the infrastructure stimulus package in the US at USD1.2tr. Still attractively valued, helped by a strong balance sheet. At 8.4x 22E EV/EBITDA the valuation remains attractive against its 30-year median at 8.9x. Cash generation has remained strong with debt now expected at USD6.1bn, despite investments (seventeen acquisitions and organic capex) of USD1.4bn and the continuation of the share buyback adding up to USDO.8bn. We would expect another healthy dividend increase for 2021 on that basis, which would be the thirty-eighth year of uninterrupted progressive or stable dividends. Quite a track-record.

KGX GY,KGX,Nov 15 2021 04:30PM,KION,Industrials,"Stepping up the game, PT EUR 135 (120) ","KION's newly revealed FY-23 EBIT guidance lands c.10% above consensus; thereinthe SCS segment surprise (c.17%) is greatest. We discuss surprise drivers in accelerated end-market growth, market share gains and sustainably higher margins. e KION is now warehouse automation first which is a teen-growth, teen-margin and highly cash-accretive business (negative NWC); we estimate that an increasing EBIT share of SCS (almost half in FY-23) should drive a 1.0x multiple expansion by FY-23. e KION remains a top pick for 2021, preferred over Jungheinrich (JUN3 GY, €45.72, Hold): our new price target of EUR 135 (from EUR 120) implies c.30-35% potential upside and a FY-23 EV/EBIT of 14.4x (five-year trailing average 13.3x, sector c.14.0x), i.e., an expansion of c.1.0x; we strongly reiterate our Buy rating. ","SCS EBIT greatest surprise; warehouse automation now is essential to survive KION at its investor event released new FY-23 targets of >EUR 12bn group sales and an EBIT adjusted margin of 10-12% (this implies EBIT of EUR 1,350m, c.10% above consensus). On a segment level, the EBIT surprise within SCS (warehouse automation, implied EBIT c.17% above) was greater than in ITS (forklift trucks, c.7% above). KION explains that during the pandemic even the best and most sophisticated supply chains are challenged. Companies would now think of automation as essential to survive and not only react to the pandemic but also act to prepare for future challenges in the next 5-10 years. Thus, customer capex needs increase and KION estimates the warehouse automation end-market will grow at a 2021-23 CAGR of c.11%. KION to continue to gain share; margin expansion via scale, mix, cost reduction Enabled by e-commerce as a channel, key warehouse automation verticals continue to see disproportionate strong growth. This includes general merchandise, grocery, food beverage and apparel (c.70% of total). With domain expertise, scale and technology differentiation KION perceives this opportunity and expects to outgrow the market with FY 21-23 CAGR of c.15%. KION also plans to expand margins from c.11.5% in FY-21 to 12-14% in FY-23. Chief drivers would be operating leverage, service share (CAGR c.20%), low-cost country production and engineering (construction of new China plant, hiring of engineers and programmers outside Germany) and standardisation of solutions (from 20% to 40% by FY-23). KION is now warehouse automation first; we estimate c.1.0x multiple expansion We continue to estimate SCS sales doubling from c.EUR 2.4bn in FY-19 to c.4.8bn in FY-23 and EBIT to almost triple. This means SCS generates close to half of KION’s EBIT in FY-23 (FY-19 c.25%). With SCS NWC as a percentage of sales negative (low to mid- single digit), we now estimate a group level of <8% mid-term (c.12% in FY-20, c.8.5-9.5% pre-pandemic). As a teen-growth, teen-margin and highly cash-accretive business SCS should fetch a higher multiple (Dematic acquisition EV/EBIT pre-/post cost synergies 18.1x/16.4x). Assuming Jungheinrich’s five-year trailing EV/EBIT of 12.0x for ITS anda pre-crisis automation multiple of 16.0x for SCS, we estimate the shift in EBIT mix should drive c.1.0x expansion by FY-23. KION remains top idea, fair value implies c.30-35% upside, Buy strongly reiterated KION trades on a FY-23 EV/EBIT of c.11.1x versus the five-year trailing average of c.13.3x. To capture KION’s structurally higher sales and FY 21-23 rebound in profitability, we value the shares using a DCF method that yields a price target of EUR 135 (from EUR 120). We have lowered our WACC to 6.0% (from 6.25%) to reflect higher mid-term visibility after the recent event. This implies c.30-35% potential upside and a FY-23 EV/ EBIT of c.14.4x, i.e., an expansion of c.1.0x.

WLN FP,WLN,Nov 01 2021 02:00AM,Worldline,Payment Services,"Still attractive, now without Terminals ","Worldline raised its organic top-line growth guidance to 9-11% CAGR in 2021-24,ahead of the 5.7% growth seen in 2017-19 (3.1% in 2017-20), driven by Merchant Services growth accelerating to DD. The contribution from online payments should continue to marginally increase in the coming years as more merchants adopt an omni-channel payment strategy. Furthermore, OMDA margins should increase by >400bps in the next three years, in line with its long-term historical average. e As the payment processing industry continues to consolidate over the medium- term, we believe Worldline will be one of the key industry consolidators in Europe, especially of processing arm of European banks, providing upside risks to estimates. e The classification of Terminals as ‘discontinued operations' increases the uncertainty around near-term execution and valuation of the business. We conservatively assumed the EV contribution from the now discontinued Terminals to be c.€2bn, resulting in a DCF-based target price of €70 (from €95). We retain our Buy rating on Worldline. ","FY24 guidance sets a benchmark Worldline initiated its FY24 guidance of — (1) FY21-24 revenue CAGR of 9-11%,, (2) >400bps of OMDA margin improvement in the next three years with FY24 OMDA margins approaching 30%, and (3) c.50% OMDA conversion by 2024 (from c.42% in FY21). More specifically, WLN expects DD growth in Merchant Services (65% of revs) driven by the secular move towards online transactions, SMB market share gains, while Financial Services (25% of revs) should grow by MSD, and Mobility and e-Transactional Services (c.10% of revs) should grow by MSD- HSD. WLN management has historically been laser focussed on profitability improvement and had achieved c.130 bps of underlying OMDA margin improvement on average in the last 9 years. The FY24 OMDA margin guidance continues to look for similar average annual margin expansion on better top-line momentum, achievable in our view. Terminals classification and lack of online push, a drag Worldline's decision to classify Terminals as ‘discontinued operations’ came as a surprise to the market. While this provides a clear signal to the market on WLN's strategic plans wrt the Terminals business, the lack of precise timeline and structure of the deal leads to uncertainty which should in turn affect employee retention/attrition, if it were to persist for long. Elsewhere, online transactions represent c.30% of WLN's Merchant Services revenues. While WLN opined that online transaction growth should continue to outpace in-store payments, the company did not include any medium-term targets on the online payments front, a surprise given the accelerated adoption of online channels through / post the COVID-19 pandemic. M&A to continue to provide upside risks M&A has and remains a core growth driver for Worldline. The company has acquired over 10 companies since its IPO in 2014, with an average annual M&A revenue tailwind of c.20 percentage points. A large fraction of acquiring banks and card-issuing banks still insource their processing business. We believe that the ever-changing regulatory environment is likely to push banks to further focus on their core businesses and divest/outsource their payment- processing activities. Given Worldline's geographic reach, scale and credibility, we expect the company to capitalise on this potential M&A tailwind. Valuation and catalysts Worldline will report its FY21 revenues on 22 February.

IFX GY,IFX,Nov 25 2021 12:16PM,Infineon,Technology Hardware,Still a stock to own for 2022 ,"With investors debating whether the semi cycle has peaked, we reiterate our Buyrating on IFX. In this note, we take a look at the key demand drivers and conclude that structural growth dynamics for IFX remain intact. Also, we analyze near-term inventory data points that suggest to us that the cycle is unlikely to turn in the near term as a potential inventory correction remains postponed well into H2-22 or 2023. e Therefore, going into 2022 we expect that IFX will continue to get margin support from a favourable pricing environment that is driven by low inventories and short supply especially in automotive, the core end market of IFX (44% of group revenue). e Thus, we expect positive earnings momentum to persist for most of next year and expect another guidance raise at the latest with H1 reporting in early May-22. ","Strong catalysts to sustain outperformance into 2022 While we are aware of investors' cycle fears and the risk of a potential inventory correction at some point later in H2-22 or 2023, our analysis suggests that car OEMs and system integrators will operate at higher inventory levels over the next 18+ months, as a result of the painful supply disruptions they have suffered over the past 12 months. In addition, as highlighted in Chart 2 on page 3, we expect the significant car underproduction to reverse in 2022. Thus, we expect positive demand and pricing dynamics in automotive to provide room for upside surprises at IFX's auto division (44% of sales). The second upside catalyst could come from capacity expansions at the right time in Villach and Dresden that will enable IFX to meet growing demand to a greater extent than competitors in an environment of short supply while at the same time freeing up inhouse 200mm capacity for higher-margin industrial products. Pricing power and USD strength support earnings momentum — guidance now conservative Over the coming months, we believe that IFX will continue to see margin benefits from pricing power, resulting from supply tightness and low inventories especially in the company's core market automotive. We have, thus, slightly raised our adj. EPS estimates further by 4%/7% for FY 2022E/2023E. Detailed estimate changes are shown in Chart on page 3. The finetuning of our financial model lifts our price target slightly to €49.00 from €48.00. IFX's 2022 guidance is based on a USD/EUR rate of 1.20 and the company does 3M forward rolling hedging. If the rate stays at the current 1.12, we estimate that our full-year segment profit would increase by another 4%. Thus, IFX's guidance has become conservative and we expect an upgrade to the upper end of the guided revenue range over the coming quarters with a margin uplift to 21.5% vs. 21% at the moment. Valuation and catalysts IFX’s valuation multiples have increased over the past two months as the company has started to execute on pricing power. Nevertheless, the stock is still trading only in line with large cap semiconductor peers, which are valued at 15x EV/EBITDA 2022E (median). Given its overexposure to those end-markets with the highest content growth potential over the long term (auto & industrial), we believe valuation multiples have further room to expand in the course of 2022. We base our price target on 16.5x EV/EBITDA 2022E.

High-time to focus on FY22 FY21 cumulative: 1) Covid-19 lockdowns hurting trading (particularly in Asia-Pacific) and sourcing (Vietnam); 3) Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) leading to a boycott by Chinese consumers of leading international sporting goods' brands. 2021 margins also suffered from the Reebok disposal (negative c€250m EBIT impact or c120bp on EBIT%). We were encouraged by management's confidence that ADS would reach 8-10% sales growth (CER) - at a minimum - in FY22 despite another €600m drag on 1Q22 sales (China/ Vietnam/supply-chain disruptions). Beyond the potential risk of new lockdowns, the main risk applies to China, in our view. Beyond low comps for next year, how long will it take to return to the previous growth pattern? China: not out of the woods yet Greater China was down 15% YOY in 3Q21 and down 19% on a 2-year stack basis, confirming challenging market conditions for the adidas brand in the country. China was also the only region in the quarter where Puma (PUM) trends were not materially different from and above Adidas' trends. PUM sales were down 16% in China in 3Q21 (vs. -15% for ADS) and down 14% on a 2-year stack (vs. -19% for ADS). During the earnings call, ADS management flagged a minor improvement over recent weeks in Greater China but no evidence of any material recovery. Moreover, ADS remains at a competitive disadvantage vs. local competitors (such as Anta or Li Ning) as local athletes and celebrities are still reluctant to cooperate with western brands as they did in the past. Marketing capabilities are not back to normal yet. China accounted for half of the €600m drag on sales in 3Q21 from one-off disruptions. 2025 targets still within reach with China now the main risk Adidas detailed its 2025 ambition to investors on 10 March 2021 (CMD), i.e. two weeks before the BCI derailed leading international sporting goods brands (including Adidas) from their growth trajectories in the country. Management's 2025 targets are still achievable by Adidas, in our view, but require that China returns to its double-digit structural growth path. Note that NKE ($168.26, covered by colleague Jim Duffy), ADS and PUM managements all expect their operations in China to recover +DD sales growth, outperforming companies' average sales growth over the longer term. China is a core driver for organic sales growth and margin expansion. Buy rating and €350 PT confirmed We value ADS with a DCF model with unchanged 8% WACC and 3% perpetuity growth rate).

JUN3 GY,3-Jun,Nov 10 2021 02:37AM,Jungheinrich,Industrials,"""Strategy 2025+"" is a clear positive ","Jungheinrich reported Q3 final results: initial reaction positive. New mid-termoutlook of EUR 5.5bn in sales and a 8-10% EBIT margin by 2025 is c.25% above BBG consensus (sadly three estimates only, c.4% above Stifel). Previously raised FY-21 outlook unchanged, Q3 final results in line. KION (KGX GY, EUR 96.84, Buy) is part of our three top picks for 2021, preferred over Jungheinrich: we expect both KION’s higher share in IC-trucks and the nature of the exposure within warehouse automation (natural partner for larger e-commerce customers, regional focus US) to be more beneficial in 2021. We therefore consider both its relative valuation ","and absolute discount unjustified and unsustainable (KION still trades on a c.20% discount on FY-23 EV/EBIT versus its five-year trailing average). After releasing Q3 prelims on 25 October, Jungheinrich reported final results, key points: #1 New mid-term outlook implies c.25% consensus upside: As expected Jungheinrich released an updated mid-term outlook “strategy 2025+”. Jungheinrich now guides for organic sales to grow to EUR 5.5bn (previous >EUR 4.6bn) and an EBIT margin of 8-10% (from >8%). This would imply a FY-25 EBIT of c.EUR 495m at the mid-point. BBG consensus FY-25 sales EUR 5.14bn, EBIT 394m, 7.7% margin. Stifel estimate EUR 5.25bn sales, EBIT EUR 475m, 9% margin. We see c.25% upside to this BBG consensus (three estimates only). #2 Previous FY-21 guidance raise, consensus more plausible: Jungheinrich now guides for an FY-21 order range of EUR 4.6-4.8bn (mid-point EUR 4.7bn), sales range EUR 4.0-4.2bn (unchanged, mid-point EUR 4.1bn), EBIT reported EUR 340-370m (mid-point EUR 355m). Jungheinrich comments that “production shutdowns have been avoided until now, material price increases were more than offset by price adjustments and efficiency measures”. Consensus now assumes group sales of EUR 4.2bn and EBIT of c.EUR 345m (i.e., c.2% below mid-point, c.5% below higher end). #3 Q3 final results in line with prelims: Orders up 26% y/y (no consensus, 6% above Stifel) likely best explained by strong demand also in warehouse automation. Sales up 12% y/y (in line), EBIT up 62% y/y with a margin of 8.6% (no consensus, in line with Stifel) best explained by operating leverage and structural cost savings.

HOLN SW,HOLN,Nov 18 2021 02:34AM,Holcim Ltd,Building Materials,Strategy 2025: Changing Reality & Perceptions ,"Holcim launched its Strategy 2025 Accelerating Green Growth this morning ahead of itsCMD today. As highlighted before, when it comes to cement and Holcim, we consider the glass not half, but completely empty. So, any change in reality and hence perception should change its rating disproportionally relative to its peers. The targets set out this morning, not only drive growth and raise returns, but also shift the Group further towards a more sustainable future. This will be done via M&A, but more importantly via the use of smart technologies and the move to more sustainable products with clear penetration targets provided. The Group will also spend more capex for this, albeit the uplift appears limited. With the Group having overachieved its 2022 targets one year early, we think that there is a good basis for investors to consider these 2025 targets as credible. At the end of the day the stock’s valuation and management’s achievements don’t match so far. We think with the macro backdrop around emerging markets and commodities moving in the right direction, Holcim represents a solid investment opportunity with a medium-to-longer-term view. 2025 and its new strategy is hence not a bad horizon to consider the stock. ","Raising the bar in terms of financial targets and growth. Having achieved a ROIC of >8%, the Group is now aiming for a 10% return. In terms of cash generation, management is now so comfortable, that it aims for 45% vs the previous >40%. Sales growth LFL is maintained at 3-5%, but now comes with an added target of an over-proportional increase in recurring EBIT LFL. The balance sheet policy remains one of strength with a ND/ EBITDA ratio below 1.5x (vs <2x before). This is something we particularly like for cyclical companies allowing the Group to remain flexible around M&A, share buy-backs and the dividend. Bolt-on acquisitions in mature markets in RMC and aggregates will be an ongoing feature of its capital allocation. Overall, the Group hence targets to accelerate growth across all its markets with innovative products, digitisation and sustainability. Setting the bar in terms of sustainability targets and reinforcing its new culture. 25% of RMC sales are expected to come from ECOPact with a 30-100% lower COo footprint. Recycling should also become a major theme with some 10mt of construction & demolition waste recycled in its products and 75mt of recycled materials overall. This too should reduce the CO2 footprint of its products sold. Green capex is set at CHF 500m, which is probably the one area the Group could have been more realistic. We believe that the adoption of new, smart technology may well be higher than this eventually. Rio Tinto’s budget at USD 7.5bn tells you as much. In terms of financing, the Group also links this with 40% of its funding to sustainability goals. Finally, the Group highlights that these results will be delivered within a high-performance culture while operating at the highest level of ethics and integrity. This should imply that management rewards across the Group are tied to these results, while any misbehaviour such as the Syrian one inherited from the previous management are complete no goes. Accountability has hence been established as a key part of the Group’s performance now. Expanding its Solutions & Products division. Holcim wants to expand this division to 30% of sales (from currently 16%), which will help improve its COz footprint, but also raise growth and returns is pursued in a value creating manner. The Firestone Building Products division is an important platform here, but we would not be surprised to see the Group enter other adjacent light-side, low carbon product areas.",Tobias Woerner,Tobias Woerner,65,,Buy,,CHF,4.15,,4.58,,2,2,,,,,M,STIFEL_Strategy 2025-_FlashCoNote_Nov 18 2021 02-34AM.pdf,STIFEL_Strategy 2025-_FlashCoNote_Nov 18 2021 02-34AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=9d34da8e-8bd7-4745-bcb1-5494747ca3a0&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
SDF GY,SDF,Nov 11 2021 02:08AM,K+S,Chemicals,Strategy update with new financial targets ,"Ahead of today's CMD, K+S provides new financial targets. Over a five-year period(covering one cycle), K+S targets a 20% EBITDA margin and to earn the cost of capital (currently 9.4%). As of 2023, FCF should be at least neutral, even at trough potash prices on a group level but also for each site. The minimum dividend will be EUR 0.15. A higher dividend depends on earnings and balance sheet strength. K+S Q3 EBITDA was EUR 121m (+58% y/y, Stifel: EUR 124m, consensus: EUR 122m). On 26 October, K+S increased the EBITDA guidance to EUR 630m (previously: EUR 500-600m). ","FCF was again considerably negative at EUR -69m in Q3 (H1: EUR -83m), but explained by EUR 50m energy payments for H2 (usually in Q4). In addition, NWC increased due to higher receivables. Restructuring and the bond buyback added another c.EUR 50m cash out. The break-even FCF 2021 guidance takes into account that EUR 50m capex will be postponed to 2022 pushing 2021 capex below EUR 400m. Agriculture volume was 1.76mt in Q3-21 after 1.65mt the year before. ASP increased from EUR 226/t in Q3-20 (trough level) to EUR 301/t, which is also a strong sequentially increase by EUR 50/t. The ASP is EUR 14/t higher than expected, but did not translate into a beat on earnings, as unit costs were also higher than anticipated. Guidance speaks for strong Q4: The 2021 EBITDA guidance of EUR 630m compares with consensus of EUR 620m. The guidance translates to EUR 272m EBITDA for Q4. Due to the early potash volume commitment, Q4 Agriculture ASP represents mainly the Q3 market prices. The recent push in potash prices, especially in K+S' home market Europe will only be reflected in Q1-21, which already lends high confidence in a strong start in 2022. Complete reversal of potash impairment of EUR 1.4bn: The 2020 impairment test based on external potash price assumptions resulted in an impairment of EUR 1.86bn in 2020. EUR 180m was reversed in Q1-21 and EUR 147m in Q2-21. The test for the PPE asset value has to be repeated every quarter. The much better potash price outlook resulted in the complete reversal of the impairment. However, the investigation of DPR (Deutsche Prufstelle fur Rechnungswesen) is still pending, analysing whether the impairment in 2019 should have been taken earlier.

TNXT IM,TNXT,Nov 11 2021 01:00AM,Tinexta,Business Services,"Strong 4Q Ahead, Raising Visibility on FY21 Targets ","Tinexta released an overall solid set of 3Q results, with adj. EBITDA comingbasically in line with our expectations and around +4% ahead of sell-side consensus. As expected, an improving performance by Digital Trust and a positive contribution from Cyber Security were counterbalanced in the quarter by softer results for Credit Information & Management and Innovation & Marketing Services (mostly due to tough comps YoY). Management’s indications on 4Q (high-season) were upbeat for most of the core businesses, raising in our view visibility on FY21 guidance (confirmed). The closing of the agreement with Bregal Milestone (likely by year-end) should pave the way for more M&A deals in the coming months. ","3Q broadly in line with forecasts... Tinexta released 3Q revenues of €83.7m, up by +28.7% YoY, as expected mostly driven by the consolidation of the newly created Cyber Security unit and a +7% organic growth YoY for the Digital Trust division. We would highlight that both the Credit Information & Management and the Innovation & Marketing Services segments had particularly tough comps YoY, as 3Q20 benefitted from strong rebound post-pandemic, additionally boosted by the effects of the Italian Law Decree no. 23 of 8 April 2020 (so-called “Business Liquidity”). 3Q adj. EBITDA reached €21m (from €22m in 3Q20), corresponding to a margin of 25.1% vs. our estimate of 24.7% (factoring in the dilutive effect of the consolidation of the cyber security activities and lower contribution from the Credit Information & Management and the Innovation Marketing Services segments). The net financial position decreased to €192m (from €205m as at the end of 1H21), thanks to a strong quarterly FCF. ...and strong 4Q ahead across all core businesses. Management seemed overall upbeat about achieving a strong 4Q performance (in the most important period of the year given the seasonality of the business), with Digital Trust continuing to grow faster than expected, easier comps YoY for both the Credit Information & Management and the Innovation & Marketing Services segments, and with the integration of Cyber Security activities being well on track. FY21 guidance (pointing to sales of approx. €370m, EBITDA of €96m and net debt/EBITDA ratio of around 2x on a Ifl basis) was confirmed and becomes in our view highly visible. Closing of the agreement with Bregal Milestone (likely by year-end) should pave the way for more M&A over the next months. Following the closing of the recently- announced €100m investment by Bregal Milestone for a 16% stake in InfoCert, we believe that the company may be pursuing more M&A deals in the coming months, likely involving the Digital Trust and the Innovation & Marketing Services sectors (with potential bolt-on acquisitions for the Cyber Security division) while, geographically, Spain, France and Germany could be the top priorities. Assuming a net debt/EBITDA ratio of up to 2.5x, we estimate that the company may have additional M&A firepower of >€400m over the next three years (FY22-24). Buy rating reiterated, price target raised to €52.20 (from €49.50). Update of forecasts to mainly factor in the Bregal Milestone deal. We have fine-tuned our estimates below the EBITDA line and factored in the recently-announced agreement with Bregal Milestone (conservatively assuming its closing at the beginning of next year, with cash-in of €70m at closing and €30m within the following 12 months). We reiterate our positive stance on the stock, with a €52.2 price target (up from €49.50, mainly due to a re-rating of sector multiples since our last update), implying potential upside of c.27% vs. current market valuation. At our target, the shares would trade at FY22 adj.

Q4 profit below mostly explained by Healthineers (that was already released). Tangible positive surprise potential from end-markets now appears increasingly limited. The Energy spin-off as part of the conglomerate dissolution was the chief driver of sustainably higher multiples; to drive these even higher, the end-game in a Healthineers' deconsolidation is likely required which is not imminent.

","Key points: #1 FY-22 guidance released, FY-21 guidance achieved: Siemens guide for FY-22 organic sales growth of mid-single digit (three industrial segments however each 5-8%), b-t-b >1 and EPS pre PPA of EUR 8.70-9.10 (mid-point EUR 8.90, FY-21 EUR 8.32, i.e. 7% increase y/y).

Organic growth was+9.2% yly (vs. 7.9% consensus), notably driven by a better-than-expected performance in Hospitality, and a solid momentum across other segments. e The FY-21 organic growth guidance is revised upward to >6% from 5-6% (vs. 6.2% consensus). We thus raise our revenue estimate by +1.4%. e Elis lifted its adj. EBITDA margin guidance (from c.34.5% to >34.5%) despite the cost inflation. We raise our own estimates, despite remaining prudent on cost inflation risk into 2022. e The investment case developed in our recent note is strengthened in our view by this solid publication. We therefore reiterate our BUY rating and €19.5 PT. ","Faster recovery of the Hospitality segment (27% of 2019 revenue): The activity was -25% below its 2019 level during Q3 vs. an initial guidance of -25% during the summer and -30% in September. In addition, the group now guides for -25% in Q4, vs. -30% initially. The group saw a rebound in leisure demand, as well as solid business demand. We have now aligned our Q4 scenario to Elis', and maintain our 2022-23 scenario broadly stable (c.-15% below 2019 levels in 2022E and close to 2019 levels in 2023E). The group also sees a strong momentum in the rest of the business: Healthcare, Industry, Trade & Services are together back 5% above 2019 levels of activity. FY-21 organic growth guidance lifted: The group now guides for >6% organic growth in 2021, up from 5-6% previously (vs. 6.2% consensus). We deem this new guidance accounts for the better Q3, and revised Hospitality scenario for Q4, while remaining prudent regarding future COVID-19 developments. It should not trigger material revisions to the FY-21 consensus organic growth. However, we believe 2022 consensus organic growth of c.10% should be revised upward, accounting for solid momentum across all end-markets, and expected price increases from Jan-22 due to the current inflationary environment. Reassuring 2021 margin guidance: The group raised its adj. EBITDA margin guidance from c.34.5% to >34.5%, despite current cost inflation. We deem it was driven notably by operating leverage (with higher-than-expected revenue) and by a positive mix effect from the workwear segment. We thus raise our 2021E EBITDA margin from 34.4% to 34.7%. However, we have maintained our 2022E estimate stable at 34.5% as we remain cautious regarding cost inflation. Nevertheless, we have raised our EBITDA by 2%/1% in 2021/22E, thus standing 4% above consensus in 2022E.

GEBN SW,GEBN,Nov 05 2021 02:24AM,Geberit,Construction Supplier,Strong price setting power to lift sales ,"The announced extraordinary price increase in selective markets and productcategories in Q4-21 should result in a positive price impact of 5% at the beginning of FY-22 (and between 3% and 4%, on average, in FY-22E, depending on the normal price increase as of the beginning of Q2). @ We increase our FY-21/22 sales forecasts by +1.1%/+0.7%. Based on the higher FY-21 base, our organic sales growth assumptions are slightly reduced, from +7.0% to +6.3% (but on a higher absolute level), assuming rather stable end- markets (volumes), positive impact from upselling and market share gains (beside the mentioned price impact). e Given the increased FY-21 EBITDA margin guidance and achievable profitability level, Geberit will most likely overachieve its medium-term ROIC target of 25%. We expect Geberit to announce a new medium-term ROIC target next spring. e Based on our unchanged valuation approach, despite higher estimates, our price target is slightly reduced from CHF 875 to CHF 850 due to lower peer group multiples. Nevertheless, we reiterate our Buy rating. Geberit's business model offers high price setting power and stability, as well as low supply-chain and end-market risks. ","Another extraordinary price increase (and further normal price increase if necessary) After the 1.5% normal price increase last spring (end-Q1, beginning of Q2), some extraordinary price increases in countries with weak currencies in Q2 (e.g. Turkey, Russia), the extraordinary price increase of 3.5% as of mid-year for Installation & Flushing Systems and Piping Systems, and the announced extraordinary price increase in selective markets and product groups of 1.5% on average in Q4-21, Geberit will start next year with a positive price impact of +5%. Of course, this impact will fade during the year (we assume a 3% to 4% positive price impact for the full year, assuming a further price increase during the year). Weaker home improvement trend in Q3 explains Bathroom Systems' underperformance but Google Trends shows positive signs in recent weeks Conducting our Google Trends analysis of search queries as an indication of demand and business development, we observe recovery trends for bathroom-related internet search queries in recent weeks. This is somewhat of a counter-argument to Geberit's assessment that there are first signs of a slowdown in the home improvement trend in Q3-21, like the underperformance of its Bathroom Systems' product area, or fewer people in its customer showrooms. Furthermore, the price increases in the other two product areas also helped to outperform the Bathroom System product area (which saw no price increase by mid-year). Over-the-cycle growth target of 4% to 6% and EBITDA margin target of 28% to 30% won't be changed despite overachievement in FY-21E, but ROIC target could be lifted The third medium-term quantitative target is often ignored — return on invested capital (ROIC) — to reach 25% in the medium term. It was set at the time of the Sanitec acquisition and looked to be out of reach for many years. However, given the high profitability to be reached in FY-21E, we expect Geberit to report a ROIC of 26.4% (based on the company definition), or a ROCE of 25.6% (based on our definition). As it is very likely that Geberit's asset base will grow slower than its operating results also in the future, we expect ROIC and ROCE to increase further, and so we expect Geberit to announce a new ROIC target next spring.",Christian Arnold,Christian Arnold,850,875,Buy,,CHF,21.8,,22.3,,13,13.5,,,,,M,STIFEL_Strong price_CoNote_Nov 05 2021 02-24AM.pdf,STIFEL_Strong price_CoNote_Nov 05 2021 02-24AM,EARNINGS UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=f665396f-358c-482e-bd47-3d376dc9c456&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
ELE SM,ELE,Nov 04 2021 02:00AM,Endesa,Utilities,"Strong Q3-21 results, but regulatory risk in Spain is still there ","Endesa reported strong Q3-21 results, better than our and consensusestimates. e Hedging policy more than offset the negative impact from the sharp rise in Iberian power prices. e Guidance for FY-21 EBITDA and net profit was confirmed, while NWC evolution drove a significant increase in net debt guidance. e We confirm our Hold rating on the stock. Regulatory risk for Spanish utilities is still high, in our view, after the recent regulatory changes made by the government. We raised our PT to €21.3 from €20.9. ","Endesa reported strong Q3-21 results in a difficult environment Endesa reported strong Q3 results, when considering the difficult external environment the company faced in the quarter, due to surging power prices in the Iberian market. On reported basis, EBITDA increased by 52% y/ y and net profit by 64%, both higher than our and consensus’ estimates. Endesa's hedging policy on the commodity side allowed it to offset the negative impact on supply margins from high power prices. Net debt evolution represented the negative side of Q3 results Net debt increased by 45% versus year-end 2020, mainly driven by delays in the invoicing process and increasing regulatory receivables. The company anticipated that this effect will continue in Q4-21 and it will be recovered in H1-22. Net debt guidance for end 2021 was increased by 30% to €11bn from €8.5bn. Guidance for FY-21 EBITDA and net profit was confirmed During the conference call, Endesa's management reiterated the FY-21 guidance of €4.0bn EBITDA and €1.7bn ordinary net profit. We understand that Endesa's hedging policy should continue to offset in Q4-21 the negative impact from the scenario of high power prices in the Iberian market. No impact from gas claw-back, lower impact from CO2 claw-back Our estimates for 2021 remained mostly unchanged. We do not expect any significant impact from the gas claw-back measure, as recently amended by the Spanish government. We raised our estimates for 2022-25 on average by 7% per year at EBITDA level and by 16% at the bottom line. We reduced the negative impact expected from the CO2 claw-back to be applied as of 2022, consistent with the new version recently proposed by the Spanish government. We also increased our estimates for integrated margins as of 2023, consistent with the current forward curve of Iberian power prices. We confirm our Hold rating, mainly on the still high regulatory risk for Spanish utilities We confirm our Hold rating on the stock. Our cautious stance is mainly due to the increased regulatory risk for Spanish utilities due to regulatory changes announced by the government in the recent months. We think that the Spanish government's response to the sharp rise in power prices in the international gas market has reduced the level of confidence in regulatory stability. The potential implementation of further unexpected measures, should the current high level of power prices persist longer than currently indicated by the forward curves, cannot be ruled out, in our opinion.

HOLN SW,HOLN,Oct 29 2021 01:34AM,Holcim Ltd,Building Materials,Strong Q3-21 — Setting The Scene For The CMD ,"The Group delivered quite solid Q3-21 results given that these were expected to be onthe weaker side, held back by higher energy costs, weather and comps. In a way, these results were already priced, while continued price increases and the upcoming CMD probably are not. We would also argue that we are only starting to see the benefits many of its commodity driven emerging markets should experience over the coming years. We also expect its businesses on the Sub-Continent to benefit from a significant growth trajectory and real price inflation over the next decade. Finally, the Group is working hard on its ESG performance, which should eventually be recognised, if only in the context of the significant value on offer. Holcim is 'the' stock to go for with regard to these themes, in our view. Any weakness in its share price should hence be used to build a position in this stock, which could outperform for years. We have only recently added the stock to our European Top Ideas List. ","e@ Q3-21 results are pretty solid given the steep rise in energy costs (see Figure 1). Recurring EBIT increased +4.7% to CHF1,534m, some +4.5% above consensus. Margins saw a certain degree of dilution (down -130bps to 21.1%) due to higher energy costs, Firestone Building Products (‘FBP’), challenging comps and weather. The price over cost spread was actually still positive to the tune of -CHF105m in Q3-21, which comes as a positive surprise relative to the sector. Except Asia Pacific, price over cost was positive in all regions, which is quite an achievement. By region the company outperformed consensus in Asia Pacific, Europe and Latin America (by +8.5%, +4.0% and +6.7% respectively). Middle East Africa and North America performed pretty much as expected, albeit the former did slightly better and the latter slightly worse than we expected. North America was held back by supply chain constraints, while Africa Middle East was held back by Algeria and Egypt. Volumes were slightly down for the quarter in cement (-3%), but up for both aggregates and RMC (+1% and +2% respectively). The guidance for recurring EBIT was raised to at least +22% (from +18%) with further price increases probably helping to offset any further cost pressures. This takes the recurring EBIT to ~CHF4,483m, just -2% shy and hence still in reach of consensus. e@ Its exposure to commodity markets, India and an improving ESG picture matters. The upcoming CMD should also drive expectations. The Group has almost 50% capacity exposure to commodity producing countries, which should eventually function like built-in hedge against higher energy costs (See Figure 2). Countries such as Australia, Canada, Mexico, Ecuador, Argentina, Nigeria and South Africa already showed some of these positive effects in Q3-21. The Sub-Continent, which represents ~24% of Group cement capacities should, in our view, also become a major differentiator for the stock. India delivered a solid performance in Q3-21, despite the high cost pressures. We believe the country is ahead of a significant growth trajectory (see Figure 3), while inflationary periods normally see REAL cement prices increase significantly. In terms of ESG, these results point to continued efforts by the Group. For example, Holcim continues to lead its industry’s sustainable transition as the first in its sector with 2050 net-zero targets validated by the Science Based Targets initiative. Also, FBP is seen to have double-digit sales growth in 2021, which should feed nicely through to earnings. The Solutions & Products division should make up 16% of sales vs 9% in 2020. Also, something we would expect to hear more about on the upcoming CMD on 18 November. One should also expect new targets given that the strategy 2022 ones have been practically achieved one year in advance. The stock's valuation fails to reflect this important themes and long-term drivers, in our view. At 5.7x 22E EV/EBITDA (pre IFRS 16), the stock has only once been more lowly valued over the last 30 years (with median valuation sitting at 7.9x for this period). With the reflation theme flowing through, higher commodity prices putting pressure on bond yields, we would not be surprised to see the value and the emerging markets trades gaining ground here. Also, with regard to ESG (see attached assessment), it might be time to put the argument on its head. In other words, what can companies in the 'sin-bin' do to improve their relative performance and perception and close the gap with what are significant valuation discounts vs the ESG '‘darlings'? We are in particular interested in value stocks, which can re-invent themselves, also with the help of new technology, over the next five to seven years.",Tobias Woerner,Tobias Woerner,65,,Buy,,CHF,4.11,,4.57,,2,2,,,,,M,STIFEL_Strong Q3-21_FlashCoNote_Oct 29 2021 01-34AM.pdf,STIFEL_Strong Q3-21_FlashCoNote_Oct 29 2021 01-34AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=5211dc60-cf5a-4e28-9532-df9defbc7ded&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
BAS GY,BAS,Oct 27 2021 02:21AM,BASF,Chemicals,Strong Q3 but with more headwinds ,"Q3 clean EBIT came in as expected at EUR 1.865bn (+221%, Stifel: EUR 2.1bn,consensus: EUR 1.8bn). Provisions at Others were transferred to the segments. Therefore, the segments look worse than the underlying performance really was. BASF increased the clean EBIT guidance again from EUR 7-7.5bn to EUR 7.5-8.0bn (Stifel: EUR 8.5bn, consensus: EUR 7.7bn). The FY guidance translates to EUR 1.0-1.5bn for Q4, which is -10% to +35%% y/y. The CEO expects solid demand until year-end and beyond. We see results as mixed: Chemicals and Surface Technology have seen the peak in margins and 2021 was a lost year for Agro. However, ongoing strong demand speaks for above mid-cycle earnings in 2022. ","Higher energy prices had an impact of EUR 600m for the European sites in 9M-21. Due to the price hike in October, the headwind will increase in Q4, as pricing is predominantly based on spot prices. However, in relation to the size of the company that looks manageable. In part, the headwind is offset by higher earnings at Wintershall DEA. The company outlines that supply is secured through long-term contracts. Volume was up by +6% y/y at the group level, equal to +4% above the pre-crisis level of Q3-19. Chemicals EBIT was -14% q/q. Sales were sequentially up by +8%, but margins were considerably lower than in Q2, as products saw better availability, but demand is still strong. Materials could almost defend the earnings level of the last quarter. BASF mentions production and supply chain disruptions as well as, the hurricane having a negative impact on product availability. However, volume was still +7% y/y. Better availability of products would therefore speak for higher earnings going into next year. Surface Technology saw a material q/q earnings drop by almost -60%, which was even higher than expected. Precious metal prices were down q/q and Catalysts’ and Coatings’ prime customer is the automotive industry. Consequently, it was the only segment with y/y lower volume. Catalysts were still y/y up in earnings, but Coatings down. Against rising raw material costs, Industrial Solutions almost defend the high earnings level from Q2 and was above expectations. Nutrition & Care continued its disappointing trend with -17% EBIT y/y. The reasons are the same as in H1: high base, lower prices and rising costs. The formulation plant at vitamin A for animal nutrition is still not running smoothly, which will take several more months. For Agro 2021 is another lost year. Demand was solid with volume +7% but +1% (Q2: +3%) in prices was clearly not enough to offset higher processing and logistic costs as well as FX headwinds. Regionally, North America was weak due to phasing between the quarters and drought in Canada and US midwest. The season in LatAm started strongly. Due to the high number of employees, the transfer of provisions from Others was felt as well. Wintershall DEA: The at equity earnings represent largely the earnings from the 72.7% stake in Wintershall DEA. Net earnings of the stake after c. EUR 55m PPA were EUR +97m (Q2-21: +11m), not fully reflecting materially higher oil and natural gas prices due to financial hedges. Net debt was EUR 16.8bn at the end of Q3-21 (FY-20: EUR 14.7bn, Q2-21: EUR 16bn). Q3 FCF was at EUR 1.1bn, down from EUR 1.4bn last year.

STM FP,STM,Oct 28 2021 01:42AM,STMicroelectronics,Technology Hardware,Strong Q4 margin guidance evidence of pricing power ,"ST reported solid Q3 results with a 5% beat on operating profit. Q4 guidance is a 3%beat on sales and 7% on gross profit when compared with (Bloomberg) consensus expectations. While a solid set of results has been expected, the high gross margin in Q4 of 43% is still a positive surprise and a reflection of pricing strength. Thus, full year consensus EPS forecasts for 2021 should increase again slightly today. We believe management's wording in today's conference call on mid-term trends (including the 2022 sustainability of the key sockets) will set the tone for share price performance over the coming months. We reiterate our Buy rating. ","Solid Q3 results: Q3 sales and EBIT of USD 3.2bn/605m are 0%/5% ahead of consensus expectations of USD 3.2bn/575m. FCF was at USD 420m. The gross margin reached 41.6.%. Net income of USD 474m is burdened by USD 45m losses on financial instruments. Details are shown in table 1 on this page. ST mentions that strength in smartphones compensated weakness in automotive. e@ Q4 guidance brings a higher than expected gross margin: ST is guiding for sales of USD 3.4bn in Q4-21, 3% ahead of expectations at USD 3.3bn. The gross margin guidance of 43% is surprisingly high and compares to consensus at 41.3%, implying beat of 7% at the gross profit level. This is a sign of pricing strength in our view. Visibility on 2022 demand is improving: We expect the company to comment on next year during the conference call. Last month ST already said that it expects 2022 to be another growth year.

Accordingly, Evotec’s 9M 2021 group revenue came in at €431.0m (+26% y/y like-for-like, +20% y/ y reported; preliminary guidance: €425-435m), as momentum continued in both EVT Execute (€329.0m; +22% y/y) and EVT Innovate (€101.9m; +36% y/y). Positive comps effect include milestone receipts of €36.5m (vs. €18.3m in 9M 2020), primarily from the increasingly successful and productive Bristol-Myers Squibb collaboration. ","Adjusted EBITDA declined to €70.1m (-9% y/y; preliminary guidance: €68-72m), primarily on account of lower contribution from EVT Execute (€70.1m; -9% y/ y) and slightly wider adjusted EBITDA loss recorded by EVT Innovate (€-15.9m vs. €-15.4m in 9M 2020). R&D expenses rose to €-53.5m (+16% y/y %), of which partnered R&D expenses were €-42.6m (preliminary guidance: €-41m to €-44m). SG&A expenses jumped to €-71.0m (+22% y/y). Gains from investments amounted to €245.2m (including €129.0m in 3Q), thereby pulling up the net profit attributable to shareholders to €247.0m in 9M 2021 (vs. a mere €5.8m in 9M 2020). Management pointed to positive business momentum, including the opening of the J.POD 1 facility in the US and several deals in drug discovery and development. This momentum has continued into 4Q as well, particularly on the various programmes being pursued with Bristol- Myers Squibb. Separately, we believe that the IPO of Exscientia in October 2021 likely provides increased visibility to investors on the value of Evotec’s key equity holdings (Exscientia market cap c.$2.5bn, Evotec had a stake of c.20%). Liquidity stood at €417.6m at the end of September 2021 and the successful closing in November 2021 of its ADS offering (c.$500m in anticipated gross proceeds, including underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares) has boosted liquidity notably. FY25E targets were reiterated and FY21E guidance was also retained (group revenue of €550-570m, unpartnered R&D expenses of €-50m to €-60m, and adjusted EBITDA of €105m-120m).

IFX GY,IFX,Nov 11 2021 12:47PM,Infineon,Technology Hardware,Structural growth to outweigh cyclical headwinds ,"We are finetuning our financial model for IFX, post the Q4 conference call. Our EPSestimate increases slightly by 4%/3% for FYs 2022/23. Details in Chart 1. e The IFX share price most recently has started to outperform the sector. Its new fab in Villach gives the company capacity at the right time as content growth in automotive and industrial applications are keeping demand momentum high. Thus, we expect superior revenue growth and margin expansion in 2022 that should sustain share price outperformance over the next quarters. e Our research suggests that structural growth dynamics (electrification of the car, digitalisation) overcompensate cyclical risks going into 2022. e@ We reiterate our Buy rating. ","IFX combines structural growth dynamics with bottom-up support IFX has the highest exposure to the automotive sector in our semiconductor coverage universe and, thus, seems well placed to benefit strongly from rising semiconductor content in the car (xEV, ADAS). We forecast auto semi revenue to grow >10% annually over the next five years, outgrowing the overall semi market by a wide margin. In addition, IFX's outperformance vs. semi peers will get support from (1) the new 300mm fab in Villach that will reduce manufacturing costs and free up inhouse 200mm capacity needed for higher-margin industrial products, (2) the share of value adding system solutions rising more significantly over the medium term (CY adds MCU and memory features), (3) disintermediation of auto system suppliers (i.e., Conti) with direct sourcing at semi companies by car manufacturers structurally raising the profit pool for automotive semi makers over the long term. Cyclical peak fears are set to stay for now IFX has good visibility for 2022 with the order backlog now extending up to two years of revenue. Nevertheless, book-to-bill ratios >2x have historically been a red flag for cycle investors and IFX reported a peak of 2.4x in the June-Q, followed by 2.2x in the Sep-Q. In the Q4 results conference call the company noted that this ratio will decrease further, given double booking that will naturally disappear as supply increases. Thus, cyclical peak fears are likely to stay for the remainder of H2-21, potentially providing better entry points into a 2022 gross margin improvement and growth story. Valuation and catalysts IFX’s valuation multiples have increased recently as the company has started to execute on pricing power. Nevertheless, the stock is still trading only in line with large cap semiconductor peers, which are valued at 15x EV/EBITDA 2022E (median). Given its overexposure to those end-markets with the highest content growth potential over the long term (auto & industrial), we believe valuation multiples have further room to expand in the course of 2022. We base our price target on 16.5x EV/EBITDA 2022E.

That said, Antalya has been a cash cow for Fraport pre-pandemic, and with passenger fees allowed to increase by 13%, a tripling (!) of retail space and a dynamic, leisure-driven recovery from the pandemic, we believe profitability of Antalya will increase further and that attractive dividends will be upstreamed in the future. ","What has happened? Fraport, together with its Turkish JV partner TAV (owned by Aéroports de Paris), has won the tender for the new concession of Antalya airport (2027-2051). The total price tag is €7.25bn (pre VAT), of which 25% is to be paid by the JV upfront in Q2 next year. The remaining 75% will be spread over the concession period as annual fee of €150m to €230m p.a. In addition, there is a €765m capex commitment. TAV will have a 51% stake in the JV, while Fraport will hold 49%. The JV will continue to be “at equity” consolidated, and both (Fraport and TAV) will inject €500m to finance the upfront payment and the capex (rest is debt financed). What is the impact? The overall price tag looks ambitious at first glance. The €7.25bn compares with €2bn paid (pre VAT) in 2007 when the concession was originally acquired. Importantly, however, the JV has its own financing and given the at-equity consolidation, Fraport's net debt will ""only"" be impacted by the €500m equity injection into the JV. Arguably, with leverage already high, this might not be what investors like to see given. We estimate that 2023 net debt/EBITDA of ~5.9x will now increase further to an estimated 6.3x. Why is it positive? Antalya has undoubtedly been a success story so far. Antalya, ina good year, has paid up to €100m in dividends to both FRA and ADP/TAV. The concession agreement includes increasing the fee for international passengers (which represent 80% of traffic volumes) by 13% to €17 and a tripling of retail space. Considering the strong recovery post pandemic so far (passengers have already been close to 100% of 2019 levels this autumn), profitability of this cash cow looks to further increase.",Johannes Braun,"Johannes Braun, CFA, CIIA;Marc Zeck, CFA",80,,Buy,,EUR,0.68,,4.05,,0,0,,,,,M,STIFEL_Success story_FlashCoNote_Dec 02 2021 02-33AM.pdf,STIFEL_Success story_FlashCoNote_Dec 02 2021 02-33AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=cae2f771-986c-404f-90fa-ae20a80df523&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
IFCN SW,IFCN,Oct 26 2021 01:04AM,Inficon,Technology Hardware,Supply chain hurts but semi prospects good ,"2021 set to be a good year for Inficon despite supply chain problems.e Growth outlook in semiconductor end-markets remain bright, also in the longer term. e Inficon is adding 50% more capacity in semi-products for 2022 vs 2020 — margin impact should be marginal as demand remains high. e We change our estimates only slightly and move PT up to CHF 1150. e In a bullish semiconductor environment we prefer Comet (COTN SW, CHF 346.00, Buy) due to a different exposure and more attractive valuation. ","2021 — a strong year that could have been better Inficon published a solid Q3 which was about in line with consensus and slightly below our estimates. However, due to a strong order and demand situation in semiconductor, Inficon was able to raise revenue guidance a notch (from US$480m - 500m to US$490m - 510m) while the EBIT margin guidance (18% - 20%) remains unchanged. The year could have been better as the disruption in the supply chain has held Inficon back. FY 2021 revenues could be US$50m higher (10%) and margin potentially also closer to 20%. The low gross profit margin illustrates that Inficon suffers from supply chain constraints (higher input costs, higher logistics and freight costs). Semi-outlook is bright and added capacity should benefit Inficon According to management and also our in-house US Semiconductor research the market remains very dynamic and demand is still very high. Inficon is struggling with the supply chain but also with its own capacity. As demand is still high and the order book full, Inficon has started to invest in its capacity and will have 50% higher capacity in 2022 (mid-year) compared with 2020. This will help sustain growth and should not weigh too much on margin as the capacity will be used and there is no long ramp-up.

Our newly calculated PT (DCF and peer group) moves to CHF 1150 from CHF 1080 and we reiterate our Hold recommendation. Valuation fair — we prefer Comet for three main reasons Inficon is fairly valued in our view. We still prefer Comet as we see more upside coming from the focus on RF subsystems (stronger growth compared to overall WFE spending) and with the launch of the generator platform that should push growth beyond Comet's current matchbox and capacitor business. Additionally, we still view the opportunities within Comet as more attractive (IXS and IXM with secular growth trends). Comet has started to close the valuation gap to Inficon but is still clearly undervalued vs both Inficon and VAT (covered by our colleague Juergen Wagner, VACN SE, CHF 425.80, Hold).",Michael Inauen,Michael Inauen,1150,1080,Hold,,USD,30.9,,35.4,,20,22,,,,,M,STIFEL_Supply chain_CoNote_Oct 26 2021 01-04AM.pdf,STIFEL_Supply chain_CoNote_Oct 26 2021 01-04AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=da88aeb9-b542-416e-9a13-c181384d3df9&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
DOKA SW,DOKA,Nov 30 2021 02:32AM,dormakaba,Capital Goods,Surprising CEO departure ,"Following the recently announced CFO departure, by April 2022, dormakaba alsoannounced the surprising departure of CEO Sabrina Soussan, who only joined the company at the beginning of the year. The press release refers to a departure by the end of the year in order to join a larger international group (most likely in her home country France). Jim-Heng Lee is set to become the new CEO - joining with a solid internal track record as COO of APAC - but we would nonetheless ","expect a negative share price reaction in view of ongoing management issues and presumably also weakening ESG profile. Surprising CEO departure: Sabrina Soussan joined the company in January 2021 and officially took over from Riet Cadonau in April. Considering private circumstances and a relatively high salary in comparison to other Swiss Industrials, this step comes as a big surprise to us. Mrs Soussan played a major role at the recent CMD, where the company presented its new mid-term strategy. Strategy to be maintained: dormakaba has already presented an internal successor with Jim-Heng Lee. In view of a solid track record in APAC, where the company outperformed its peers, we believe that the market will take his appointment positively. Further ESG headwinds to be expected: We expect that the market will become more negative with regard to diversity aspects (female CEO set to leave) and stay very pessimistic on the governance side.

CLN SW,CLN,Nov 24 2021 01:00AM,Clariant,Chemicals,Targets should be in reach by 2025 ,We reiterate our Hold rating with an unchanged PT of CHF 21. The positive impact ofincreased earnings estimates is offset by lower dividend and higher capex assumptions in the valuation. e@ Target of 4-6% CAGR by 2025 is based on organic growth versus former 6% including M&A. We anticipate double-digit growth in 2022 and assume >5% CAGR until 2025. e@ The margin target of 19-21% represents 100bps increase. Our estimates reflect the lower end of the range by 2025. e@ Capex discipline is a prerequisite to achieve a 40% FCF conversion rate. Capex in 2021 and 2022 represents 8% of sales and the capex guidance is 6%. ,"Clariant was not lagging in ambitious targets but in delivery: The 4-6% growth target is based on a bottom-up approach reduced by a risk discount. Top-down it is based on 2.5% end-market growth plus 1% from innovation driven by sustainability (bio-based, circularity, decarbonisation), 1% from regional growth (especially China going from 10% share to 14%) and 0.75% from the two recent acquisitions. The LTM margin was 16.3% and the gap to the target should be closed by growth (2/3rd) and efficiency (1/3rd, fueled by incremental CHF 60m savings). Our forecast discounts a front-end loaded growth of c. +10% in 2022, but slightly below 4% in 2025. While we see solid growth in consumer care, flame retardants and catalysts, it might be diluted by mature areas like Oil & Mining Services (OMS), foundry, waxes and industrial surfactants. We see the lower end of the margin target in reach, anticipating a recovery in Catalysis margin and progress in OMS. FCF only gradually improving: management expects capex will stay high in 2022 at CHF 350m, before gradually falling to CHF 280-320m in 2025 (Stifel: EUR 320m). The capex plan includes CHF 30m pa for CO2 emission reductions. Assuming the achievement of the margin target and capex/sales of 6%, we see >40% conversion rate (FCF/EBITDA) as realistic. In fact, we expect even 45%, i.e. c. CHF 450m by 2025 by Clariant's definition (before interest and leases). The FCF to shareholders might be CHF 100m lower. Rising dividend trend will start from a lower level: The CFO made clear that there will be a resizing of the dividend given the smaller company after the disposals. The last regular dividend was paid in 2019 at CHF 0.55. We expect 2021 dividends to be at CHF 0.40 and to increase at least CHF 0.05pa thereafter. Earnings forecast increased: Based on strong Q3 results, the Q4 guidance and the promising trends into 2022, we increased our EBITDA forecast for 2021 and 2022 by +3% and +6%, ""respectively; these are +4% and +5% above consensus. Sustainability is core to Clariant: The company ranks highly vs. peers in low energy intensity and having reached already 20% of sales with biobased raw materials. In this respect, the two acquisitions at Care Chemicals Beraca (Brazil) and CISC (India) were important. The VITA surfactant product range is 100% biobased. Catalysts improving the CO2 footprint of customers and for green hydrogen derivatives as well as adsorbents purifying pyroloysis oil are other sustainability examples. The >GDP growth is not least based on sustainability driven innovations contributing to the growth. Clariant set ambitious emission targets of reducing CO2 emissions scope 1+2 by -40% from 2019-30 and scope 3 by -14% (missing at most other companies). Valuation has not changed: The higher earnings estimates lift our SOTP value to CHF 25 and the EV/EBITDA value to CHF 23. However, the lower dividend assumption reduced the value based on the historic dividend to CHF 17 and the higher capex reduced the DCF value to CHF 22.

VOW3 GY,VOW3,Oct 29 2021 01:00AM,Volkswagen AG,Automotive,The CEO has a plan (and a contract) ,"The Q3 results were perceived negatively and the conference call pushedthe shares down further. There were some negatives in the report (reduced FCF outlook) and in the conference call (vague statements about potential bottlenecks other than computer chips). However, the positives outweigh this, in our view: volumes recover strongly in Q4, prices have just been increased again. Order intake remains very strong, especially for BEVs. We interpret the noise around the 5-yr planning round as an indication that management continues to push hard for more efficiency. Diess wanted a new contract until 2025 in order to have a strong mandate in the negotiations with all stakeholders to drive the transition of VW - VW is making progress. e We slightly reduce our estimates for EPS in 2022-2023 by some 2.1% as raw material prices rise. However, our estimates are 7.6% and 7.2% ahead of consensus expectations. With volumes and prices going up we expect margins to recover. Our target price moves from EUR312 to EUR308. This implies a target FCF yield of 9.1% in 2022 - in the middle of the transition. ","The CEO has a plan (and a contract): The announcement of the 5-year planning round has been moved from mid-November to December. We can't remember this ever happened before. CEO Diess mentions Tesla and the Grunheide plant so often that it must be very annoying for his team (and even investors). Diess also says that the Wolfsburg plant must not be refurbished but partially be built new. Over the last 12 months Diess was fighting hard to get his contract extended until 2025. He almost got ousted over this, but the argument was that the mandate was needed to implement change and to be in a strong position in the negotiations with all stakeholders. Eventually, in July 2021 his contract had been extended until 2025. With the backing of the supervisory board Diess now pushes hard to increase efficiency and cut cost. We think the noise around the planning round is partially an outcome from the push to more efficiency.

HOLN SW,HOLN,Nov 17 2021 01:00AM,Holcim Ltd,Building Materials,The CMD - And The Journey Continues ,"The CMD tomorrow brings the first leg of this multi-year change story to a close.More is clearly to come with targets being raised either this week or at the FY-21 results presentation. e We believe the Group is likely to review the journey so far, explain its ESG efforts with a focus on COz emissions, the repositioning of its portfolio via product development, technology and M&A. We would also expect a few pointers with regard to current trading, which should have remained resilient. e@ We believe there is significant value on offer here. In our view, a favourable macro back-drop with its high exposure to commodity countries should highlight the work done so far and accentuate the change going on from an ESG perspective. ","The CMD - What's Been Achieved So Far & Current Trading? Sometimes it's easy to forget what management has achieved so far. Delivering on its targets a year ahead of plan is no mean feat given the COVID-19 impact. We consider the balance sheet (with ND/EBITDA @ 1.0x 22E well below its target of <2x) and ROIC delivery (at >8% in 2021) as the most important targets. Delivering on its FCF conversion target of >40% is also an achievement, but is diluted by the issue of streaming cash to the parent. Clearly, the Group has made strides in its ESG targets and also the repositioning of the Group (via Firestone Building Products), but we would expect much more on that front in the future. In terms of trading, we would expect some kind of update on Q4-21. Generally, our indicators point in the right direction with price hikes feeding through, while volumes remain supportive. The CMD - What Matters Going Forward? 'Green Washing’ Won't Wash. ESG and the Group's carbon footprint are clearly a drag on the stock. It is for this reason that management efforts on this front need to be perceived as genuine rather than 'Green Washing’. Defending the status quo around existing technology and capacities won't do, in our view. Maybe, it is a matter of 'biting the bullet’ of higher capex for decarbonisation (as Rio Tinto has done) as well as closing and writing down less efficient assets. After all, a lower clinker ratio implies the need of fewer assets (before factoring in future growth). Most importantly, we would want to see the genuine will of adapting and introducing new technology and products. Because if one of the world leaders won't go down that route, somebody else or even a new entrant eventually will, in our view. M&A will also matter in context of changing the Group's footprint. But this has to be done with a focus on value and product synergies in mind. Selling off its Emerging Markets assets cheaply ahead of a new commodity cycle does not appear the right way to go. The CMD In Context Of Value ESG is starting to create market dislocations not seen since the dotcom bubble, in our view. Valuations almost don't seem to matter anymore, as long as the ESG perception provides the much-needed tick in the box. Also, the Growth vs Value discussion ignores that the growth and profitability challenges seen post the GFC are abating. At the same time companies in the ESG 'sin-bin' are all tarred with the same brush. All of this appears to be a dangerous game to play, especially if the music suddenly stops for growth stocks with rising bond yields. Perceptions can and have changed and investors should prepare themselves for this scenario, if only to hedge their portfolios. Holcim at 6.0x 22E EV/EBITDA (pre IFRS 16), seems to be very interesting stock in this regard, even when factoring in more capex for decarbonisation.",Tobias Woerner,Tobias Woerner,65,,Buy,,CHF,4.15,,4.58,,2,2,,,,,M,STIFEL_The CMD_CoNote_Nov 17 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_The CMD_CoNote_Nov 17 2021 01-00AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=696c1b8f-0ef8-4276-9a93-69fedf3a1463&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

Buy strongly reiterated. KION is part of our top three picks for 2021, preferred over Jungheinrich (JUN3 GY, €44.54, Hold): we expect both KION’s higher share in IC trucks and the nature of the exposure within warehouse automation (natural partner for larger e-commerce customers, regional focus US) to be more beneficial in 2021.

COTN SW,COTN,Nov 18 2021 04:35PM,Comet,Technology Hardware,The journey is the reward — PT up to CHF 425 ," Comet's CMD did not offer any immediate stock price triggers which the marketmight have expected. However, it did offer a better look into the company's mid- term future. e Notably, Comet's addressable market is set to almost triple until 2025. More specifically, Semiconductor markets offer the greatest opportunity for Comet. This is driven by high market shares with existing and new products. e Guidance to 2025 is now clearer and the journey to CHF 1bn in revenue has just begun. e We increase our estimates for 2025 and beyond and raise our PT to CHF 425. ","Comet's CMD offered no immediate triggers — but mid-term outlook is positive In our view, the market built up high expectations before the CMD on topics including 2021 guidance, mid-term guidance, and potential news on the generator. Since Comet left the 2021 guidance unchanged and has not yet reported design-wins on the generator, this has slightly overshadowed the more precise mid-term guidance for 2025. Given the short-term as well as mid-term outlooks are both very attractive, we are convinced perceptions will change again in the months to come. Addressable market set to triple up to 2025 The current addressable market for Comet is USD 0.9bn, with revenue mainly coming from Semi (56% and the rest split between various other markets). With the new products such as the RF generator and semiconductor packaging inspection, the addressable market is seen at USD 2.5bn in 2025, with the majority of revenue coming from semiconductor markets (73%) and the remainder more evenly split. The addressable market has again increased from the CMD in October (USD 1.9n) and reflects the growth of the end-markets and the opportunities for Comet. Semiconductor will lead the way — global market leadership pays off According to VLSI, the RF Power segment will see growth over the next 4-5 years with potential pause in 2023 and a clear pick-up again in 2024. This makes sense looking at the smaller-node fabs (better RF systems needed) coming online in the next years. Comet has the highest market shares in RF matchboxes (around 40%) and vacuum capacitors (>50%) to benefit from that growth. With the RF generator, growth should even accelerate over the next few years. Clearer 2025 guidance — CHF 1bn in revenue is realistic beyond 2025 In our view, Comet has slightly increased its mid-term guidance. The company sees revenue of CHF >830m in 2025 with an EBITDA margin of 25% and an ROCE of 30%. This is based on a revenue CAGR in the PCT division of 19% and X-ray CAGR of 13% (total CAGR 15%). This is above our estimates and also higher than what was originally guided (15% group revenue CAGR back in 2019), as we understand it. Therefore, Comet is on a good path to become a CHF 1bn revenue company. Estimates increased for 2025 and beyond — new PT CHF 425 We have raised our growth estimates from 2022 to 2025 which leads to an increase in 2025 revenue by 8% and EBITDA by 13.6% (margin up from 23.5% to 24.6%). We calculate a new PT of CHF 425 based on our valuation methodology (DCF, sum-of- the-parts, peer group valuation). Due to a clear increase in the addressable market, we raise our terminal growth rate for Comet from 3% to 3.25%. We would clearly pick up the shares at current levels as they still look undervalued versus Swiss peers (Inficon, IFCN SW, CHF 1156.00, Hold and VAT, VACN SW, CHF 478, Hold, covered by Juergen ~| Wagner), which we consider unjustified.",Michael Inauen,Michael Inauen,425,370,Buy,,CHF,7.92,,9.9,,1.42,1.48,,,,,M,STIFEL_The journey_CoNote_Nov 18 2021 04-35PM.pdf,STIFEL_The journey_CoNote_Nov 18 2021 04-35PM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=d9a03621-8f21-4b9c-8e2c-116c300365ce&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
BOSN SW,BOSN,Nov 04 2021 12:48PM,Bossard,Capital Goods,Time for a breather post share price doubling - down to Hold ,"Following the first-time-ever CMD, we continue to like Bossard's rock-solidinvestment case with its midterm annual 5% sales growth outlook as well as further margin expansion potential (12-15% cycle target range provided instead of 10-13% previously) and typically value-accretive bolt-on M&A deals (still not included in forecasts). @ We have slightly upgraded our 21/22/23 EPS forecasts by 4%/3%/3% - mainly on the back of the recent M&A announcement (Jeveka), and further expanded our long-term EBIT margin expectation from an already high level of 13.5% to 14.3%. Overall, we still believe that FY-22 consensus estimates do not sufficiently factor in considerable one-off pricing benefits in FY-21 (SFe CHF 10m+) as well as temporary rising investment needs related to the new long-term strategy. e Since December 2020, the stock has more than doubled (CHF 159.60 basis). Our updated valuation still includes an unchanged 5% ESG premium, but despite the again increased price target of CHF 365 (CHF 320), it is now only showing limited shorter-term upside potential. We therefore take a breather and downgrade the stock to Hold. ","Unchanged rock-solid investment case Following the presentation of new mid-term targets with a slightly increased sales growth target of >5% p.a. (not considered a short-term given), and EBIT margin target range of 12-15% vs 10-13% previously (upper end seen as a long-term and not mid-term perspective), we only see limited gradual changes to Bossard's well-diversified and further consolidating business model. In order to achieve more top-line growth, a higher operational efficiency and cooperation within the group, it will have to invest above average in the shorter run, e.g. into a combined ERP/CRM system (around CHF 55-60m investments seen for the next six years) and additional personnel (SFe +5% 22E). ESG picture remains favourable but no game-changing new facts out Looking at the company's new long-term Strategy 200, sustainability will also play an important role representing 1/7 initiatives. Here, the company commented that more data points need to be collected before coming up with further concrete targets such as carbon-neutrality for its own Scope 1+2 emission data. It also highlighted that the dual share structure is highly unlikely to be changed. As a general productivity enhancer, the company continues to be well positioned, in our view, but it remains tricky to quantify this without any own production activities and Scope 3 data for its entire value chain. We have re-attached our unchanged ESG assessment for further information. Promising long-term story but time to take a breather Less than a year ago, we upgraded the stock to Buy, expecting a clear end-market momentum recovery as well as a rising focus on an underlying good ESG picture. As shown in the updated comprehensive valuation overview table, even our upgraded long-term considerations with an EBIT margin of 14%(+) do not offer sufficient upside potential anymore. We now believe that investors need to look some years out, while recent management share transactions post the CMD have indicated some profit taking. Accordingly, we downgrade the stock to Hold, despite an increased price target of CHF 365 on valuation, which already gives an implied above-average EV/EBIT target multiple of 22.8x.

SRG IM,SRG,Nov 30 2021 01:00AM,Snam,Utilities,Too early for including 2030 vision in our estimates and valuation ,"Snam increased its 5-year capex by 9% versus the previous business plan,mainly due to accelerating investments in new businesses. e Snam's management provided a vision on additional growth opportunities expected to arise in 2026-30, mainly from the development of a hydrogen value chain. We found this vision very interesting, but dependent upon many moving parts and still offering limited visibility. e We confirm our Hold rating. We think it is too early to include in our estimates and valuation Snam's vision for medium-term accelerating growth. ","Acceleration in investments in energy transition businesses in 2021-25 Within the new 2021-25 business plan, Snam raised its 5-year capex by 9% versus the previous plan to €8.1bn. Total regulated capex remained almost unchanged, but with a larger contribution from gas storage, and lower contribution from gas transport. The main driver for capex growth was represented by new businesses linked to energy transition (biomethane, energy efficiency, hydrogen), whose investments almost doubled versus the previous plan. Growth targets have been increased versus the previous plan In 2022-25, EBITDA is expected to grow on average by 4.5% per year, net profit by 3.0% per year. Targets are higher than in the previous plan. They assume unchanged allowed returns in the period versus the 2021 level. RAB is expected to grow on average by more 2.5% per year, in line with the previous plan. Potential growth acceleration expected in 2026-30... Snam's management provided a vision on opportunities that would arise for the company from decarbonization of the economy and development of a hydrogen value chain. Technological developments indicating that Snam's assets would be fit for hydrogen transport and storage, along with the expected drop in hydrogen production cost, lead the company to anticipate investments amounting to €23bn in 2021-30 and accelerating RAB and EBITDA growth in 2026-30. ..but the growth depends on several moving parts We found the scenario indicated by Snam's management for 2026-30 very interesting, particularly in relation to the investment and growth opportunities that would arise for Snam from the development of a hydrogen value chain. Nevertheless, in our opinion, the medium-term outlook still depends on several moving parts in terms of regulation, technical evolution and development of hydrogen demand. Consequently, we think that it is too early to include such growth acceleration in our estimates and valuation. We confirm our Hold rating on the stock As anticipated, in our view, it is too early to include in our estimates and valuation the possible value creation that would arise from the growth acceleration indicated by Snam's management for 2026-30. Its amount and possible timing depend on several moving parts, at the moment offering limited visibility. We think it is reasonable to update our SOTP consistent with the details of the new 2021-25 business plan. We raised our price target to €5.35 from €5.25, mainly due to higher valuation of the new businesses linked to energy transition.

DAI GY,DAI,Nov 12 2021 06:00AM,Daimler AG,Automotive,Truck CMD: a lot of potential — but Daimler needs to deliver first ,"On 10 December Daimler will spin-off the Truck business. Yesterday, Truckmanagement hosted a CMD, providing 2025 targets for the divisions and a group outlook for 2022. Our key take is that there is a lot of potential, in light of electrification and digitisation, Daimler's scale and global reach should become an even bigger asset. In particular, the European business offers upside. However, Daimler Trucks has been a market leader for a long time, while profitability constantly remained below benchmark levels. We would therefore expect the market to remain cautious until Daimler delivers real progress. We would expect the market to place a discount on Daimler Truck relative to peers like Volvo, once it is a separately listed entity. For the Daimler case in general, we continue to think that the spin-off makes a lot of sense: the cases are very different, they should attract different investors and synergies are small. ","Targets for 2025: The Group EBIT margin target of >10% by 2025 in a strong market environment was already known. Management provided divisional targets for the first time: Daimler Trucks North America is the best performing business within Daimler Trucks. The divisions aims for 12% margin by 2025, up from 11.5% in 2019 and from 10.8% in YTD September. Daimler expects lower volumes compared to the peak year in 2019 — but aims to compensate this with fixed cost savings and a mix shift towards off-highway vocational trucks (which seems in contrast to the strategy in Europe, where complexity of the offering will be reduced). Mercedes-Benz (which includes is the European business and South America) offers the biggest upside. The division targets 10% margin by 2025, up from 0.4% in 2019 and 4.5% YTD September. This will be crucial for the Daimler Truck investment case. Karin Radstrém heads up the business, she joined from Scania earlier this year. The turn around plan mostly relies on fixed cost reductions and mix shifts — only 2%-points of the targets 9.6%-points improvement is supposed to come from higher volumes. Some 50% of the fixed cost reduction is to be achieved by 2021, i.e. the plan is not back-end loaded, which we believe makes it credible. Trucks Asia aims for a 9% EBIT margin. That compares with 2.3% in 2019 and 7.2% YTD September. As for Mercedes-Benz, most of the improvement is supposed to be independent of Truck markets, i.e. from cost savings and mix improvements. Targets for 2022: Daimler expects the markets for heavy trucks in Europe and the US to remain flat. That is in stark contrast to Volvo (+11% for the US, +7% for Europe). On the other side, Daimler expects a significant increase in revenues (driven by a richer mix and higher prices). For the EBIT margin, Daimler forecasts 7-9% (our forecast is 7.7%), up from an expected 6-8% in 2021. If the volume and revenues assumptions are correct, that seems conservative: a better mix and pricing, as well as the initiated cost measures, should allow for well above the target 1%-point improvement. Service revenue share to grow to c.50% by 2030: Similar to the target set by Volvo at its CMD in November 2020, Daimler Trucks aims to grow the share of service revenues from currently c.30% to c.50% by 2030 and hence to reduce cyclicality and smoothen the margin profile. We understand this will be realised through, among other things, a higher service contract penetration and longer first-life of electric trucks, as well as the offering of new and adjacent services such a charging infrastructure and new digital services.",Daniel Schwarz,"Daniel Schwarz;Alexander Wahl, CFA;Pierre-Yves Quémener",110,,Buy,,EUR,12.3,,12.8,,4.93,5.12,,,,,M,STIFEL_Truck CMD-_CoNote_Nov 12 2021 06-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Truck CMD-_CoNote_Nov 12 2021 06-00AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=1b34a5ed-63b2-4190-a80b-172abac29d5b&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
ENEL IM,ENEL,Nov 04 2021 06:37PM,Enel,Utilities,Undervalued despite short-term uncertainty ,"Enel reported resilient Q3-21 results, in very difficult market conditions.Ordinary EBITDA declined by a modest 2% versus Q3-20's level. e Rising working capital is having a negative impact on cash flow, triggering an increase in our net debt estimates. e Enel is well on track to install more than 5GW of renewable capacity in 2021. Pipeline of renewable assets reached 350GW. e We reiterate our Buy rating despite short-term risks determined by the scenario of high energy prices. We cut our price target to €8.36 from €9.20. ","Enel reported resilient Q3-21 results, in very difficult market conditions Enel's Q3-21 ordinary EBITDA and net profit were slightly better than our and consensus estimates. Ordinary EBITDA declined by a modest 2% y/y. In our opinion, the modest decline in ordinary EBITDA represents a resilient outcome, when considering the difficult external environment determined by surging power and gas prices in Italy and Spain, regulatory changes in Spain and adverse market conditions in Chile. Ordinary net profit declined by 17% y/y, mainly due to one-off costs related to liability management. Negative impact on cash flow from rising working capital Enel's net debt increased by 20% versus that of year-end 2020, mainly due to dividend payments in the period, accelerating capex, the negative impact from forex on non- euro denominated debt and increasing working capital. The latter effect is expected to continue in Q4-21. The company guided for net debt at end-2021 of €55bn, 8% higher than our previous €51bn estimate. We expect a partial recovery of working capital deterioration in 2022. We increase our net debt estimates for the period 2021-25 on average by 5% per year. Installation of renewable capacity continued to accelerate In Q3-21 Enel continued the positive trend in installing new renewable capacity. 1.0GW was added in the quarter. Total new capacity installed in 2021 will exceed 5GW, in line with the company's target, and representing a significant acceleration versus the 3GW per year installed in the past few years. The gross pipeline continued to grow, reaching 350GW, 50GW more than at the end of June. 12GW are in execution (under construction and ready-to-build). We reiterate our Buy rating, despite short-term uncertainty Q3-21 results confirm the resiliency of Enel's business to the relevant headwinds faced in the quarter. We recognise that the current scenario of high energy prices determines some short-term risks for the company. Nevertheless, we think that the current share price does not properly reflect Enel's value creation potential arising from its position as global leader in renewables and its exposure to energy transition. Enel's pipeline of renewable capacity is continuing to increase and the company is sharpy accelerating installation of new plants. The stock trades at what we view as attractive multiples and it offers visible dividend yields in excess of 5%. We reiterate our Buy rating.

TGYM IM,TGYM,Oct 28 2021 01:00AM,Technogym,Consumer Goods,Uninspiring quarter; current trading supportive ,"Technogym delivered a soft set of Q3 results, with lower-than-expected salesin both B2C and B2B channels, particularly in Europe, which was hit by some delivery shifts. However, the outlook for Q4 is encouraging, as B2C is reaccelerating and the backlog in B2B was said to be strong. e The target of reaching c.€300m sales next year in B2C was put off to 2023 (in line with the initial plan). Nevertheless, we believe the ongoing recovery in B2B should help to mitigate this, as will new commercial initiatives and other price increases designed to protect margins. e We cut our 3 year EPS estimates, on average, by 5% and reduce our PT to €11.5 (from €12.5). ","One quarter does not make a trend. Technogym reported Q3 Group sales of €149m, up +15% reported and organic, which was c.6% below our and consensus estimates. This was mainly driven by a faster sales normalisation in B2C due to the resumption of outdoor activities (-0.9% in Q3 vs +16% in Q2) and a softer-than-expected recovery in B2B (vs 2019 levels, Q3 was down -24% vs Stifel -19% and Q2 -27%), particularly in Europe, due to some delivery shifts. By region, all geographies ex-Europe were broadly in line with our estimates, and we would highlight: 1) the continuation of strong double-digit growth in MEIA despite a tougher comparison base; 2) the ongoing solid performance in APAC, driven by China; 3) the continuation of the recovery in North America, despite the underperformance of Clubs; and 4) The slowdown of the recovery trend vs 2019 levels in Europe (-21% in Q3 vs -8% in H1). Encouraging current trading commentary. After a downbeat September, B2C has re-accelerated in October, which bodes well for the key Christmas season. In the B2B channel, the pipeline remains robust and should allow Technogym to reach the current sales guidance of over €600m (cons: €625m; Stifel €621m). FY-22 outlook: B2B recovery expected to compensate for lower B2C sales. Management expects the recovery in B2B to continue in 2022, as industry operators have restarted their investments, especially clubs, where memberships in many countries are returning to at least 2019 levels and hotel occupancy rates are improving. This should compensate for a lower forecast in B2C, where the c.€300m target was postponed to 2023 (from 2022) and several initiatives in the US are envisaged from 2022. From a profitability standpoint, management sees further space for price adjustments in 2022, following the two initiated this year, while the collaboration with Dior should also help to protect margins. Component shortages are not an issue, in our view, as the company has built enough inventory until H1-22. New partnerships on sight? During the call, CEO Alessandri stated that Technogym has received interest for new collaborations from several third parties and did not exclude that one partnership a year could be a reasonable target to raise brand awareness in the B2C segment. Changes to estimates and valuation. We cut our 3-year Adj. EPS estimate by 5% on average. This reflects a lower-than-expected B2C expansion and the impact of raw material cost inflation, partially offset by the price-mix effect.

KRN GY,KRN,Nov 08 2021 11:58AM,Krones,Industrials,Up for a another refill; PT EUR 120 (from 100) ,"Alongside the lifting of COVID-19 related restrictions, we think the market for beveragefilling equipment is approaching peak momentum. This means the chief driver of the shares' underperformance is now turning into a historical tailwind. e Peak order momentum, pre-crisis sales levels one year earlier, self-help measures: our FY 22-23 EBITDA is c.7-10% ahead of consensus and c.10% above FY-21 guidance. At the upcoming CMD, we look for an EBITDA margin mid-term target of 10-13% (current 9-12%). e Krones remains a top pick for 2021: our price target of EUR 120 (from EUR 100) implies c.25-30% potential upside and a FY-23 EV/EBIT of c.12.2x (five-year trailing average 14.5x). An in-line multiple implies a fair value of EUR 140, i.e., 50% upside. ","COVID-19 related headwinds now tailwind, Krones to see peak order momentum Within our coverage, Krones still trades at the steepest discount on FY-23 EV/EBIT versus the five-year trailing average (c.35%). This underperformance is explained best with cautiously managed expectations: Krones last November commented that for its beverage filler customers to recover, they first need to see cash flows from bars, restaurants and cafés. Krones hence guided capex normalisation for mid-2023 at the earliest. That said, Krones is already set to exceed pre-crisis orders in FY-21. A chief driver of the surprise are smaller customers bridging demand from multinationals that in 2021 are bound by inflexible capex budgets. Krones expects incremental demand from these into FY-22, with the pipeline remaining strong (visibility six to eight months). Pre-pandemic sales levels now one year early; new mid-term targets at the CMD Enabled by this earlier-than-expected end-market recovery, Krones is to see peak order momentum in 2021 (9M-21 book-to-bill 1.2x). Supported by a record order book, we now assume Krones will reach pre-pandemic sales levels at c.EUR 4bn in FY-22 (current mid-term outlook of EUR 3.7-4.0bn by FY-23). Alongside a sales recovery, Krones last November reiterated its mid-term EBITDA margin target range of 9-12% (EBT 6-8%). At the CMD on 16 November 2021, we expect the company to implicitly reinstate its historical mid-term EBT target of 8%. Specifically, we would consider an over-the-cycle EBITDA margin range of 10-13% (EBT 7-9%) by 2025 plausible. Higher profit via operating leverage and added tailwind from structural measures To support a margin recovery, Krones last November presented structural measures. We estimate these should yield a gross EBIT tailwind of c. EUR 175m (>400bps gross margin upside pressure). Therein, we rate cost savings from headcount reductions at c.EUR 80-100m as imminent. As of Q3-21, Krones reduced headcount close to the targeted c.1,200 by end-FY-21 (c.930 in Germany). With the end-market now inflecting, we expect sales prices have bottomed out (acceptance of c.6% price rises would be high, with peers playing along). We again raise our FY 22-23 EBITDA estimates by c.5%. Our new FY 22-23 numbers land c.7-10% ahead of consensus, our FY-21 EBITDA forecast stands c.10% above guidance. Share remains top idea, we see c.25-30% potential upside, Buy strongly reiterated Krones trades on FY-23 EV/EBIT of c.9.5x, versus the pre-COVID-19 five-year trailing average of c.14.5x. We value the shares using a DCF method to capture exceptionally strong absolute EBIT growth by FY-23. This yields a price target of EUR 120 (from EUR 100). We have lowered our WACC to 6.25% (from 6.5%) to reflect higher visibility from a record order book. This implies c.25-30% potential upside and FY-23 EV/EBIT of c.12.2x, i.e., clearly below the five-year trailing average (in line implies a fair value of EUR 140, i.e., 50% potential upside). With order momentum reaching its peak, we expect the market focus to shift even more to self-help potential.

SYAB GY,SYAB,Nov 11 2021 01:00AM,Synlab AG,Healthcare,Updating our COVID-19 scenario ," We come out of the Q3 conference with a higher confidence that COVID-19testing revenue could remain high over the short term. Thus, we raise our 2022E revenue by +9.6% (o/w +8.3% from COVID-19 testing). e The growth and consolidation story remains on track; however, we have little visibility on the underlying profitability. e Overall, 2022 earnings remains highly geared to COVID-19, and should continue to steal the show from the underlying consolidation story. Therefore, we reiterate our Hold rating. We nonetheless raise our PT to €22.00 (from €19.50), reflecting our higher 2022 estimates, driven notably by COVID-19 testing. ","2021/22 revenue guidance looks safe thanks to COVID-19 support. Synlab now guides for >€3.5bn revenue in 2021, vs. €3.5bn cons. and €3.6bn SFe. This implies at least €728m revenue Q4, vs. €849m in Q3. We understand this guidance conservatively implies a q/q decline in COVID-19 testing revenue, despite a rebound in the European incidence rate. However, mgmt. commented during the call that they saw stable testing volumes in October vs. the previous months, and COVID-19 revenue in the range of c. €100m (vs. €312m in Q3). Thus, we could reasonably expect revenue to remain stable q/q, implying c.3% upside to 2021 revenue guidance. The core business growth is well oriented. Over 9M-21, the core business delivered +21.1% organic growth o/w +6.3% from the SEL contract, +10.8% from the easy comp. base, and +4.0% from underlying core organic growth (vs. +3.0% mid-term guidance). The mgmt. sounded positive regarding its 'For You' growth initiatives. In addition, the group accelerated its external growth as it already delivered €250m bolt-on M&A spending YTD, and expects >€200m in 2022E (vs. €200m p.a. targeted initially). The group expects to remain disciplined on price. Lack of visibility on the underlying profitability development. The mgmt. reiterated that it was not possible to provide a breakdown of the EBITDA between COVID-19 testing activities and the rest of the business. The mgmt. made clear that with its oral comments, it was intending to indicate whether there was an underlying improvement or deterioration vs. the 2019 profitability level (pro forma of A&S divestment). Nevertheless, the mgmt. wanted to flag certain dilutive impacts to the margin: (1) the SEL contract dilutes group profitability in 2021, and should continue in 2022, (2) the group's growth initiatives have an initial dilutive impact (e.g. blood collection points take 2-years to reach group profitability levels). The company reported that as of 9M-21 it had achieved €15m savings through its SALIX program (in addition to €21m in FY-20). However, this was offset by -€12m and -€6m negative impacts from inflation and price (vs. -€18m and + €11m in FY-20). We raise our 2022 COVID-19 estimates, thus lifting valuation. We raised our 2022E revenue by +9.6%, 0/w +8.3% from higher COVID-19 estimates. We now assume €566m revenue from COVID-19 in 2022E, down -60% y/y (vs. €340m previously). This is broadly in line with our H2-21 estimate. We expect COVID-19 testing to remain accretive in 2022E, thus we raise our 2022E adj. EPS by 18%. Applying our new 2022E estimates, our valuation now yield a €22.00 PT (50% DCF, 25% 15x EV/EBIT adj. 2022E, 25% 20x P/E adj. 2022E). However, excluding any COVID-19 testing revenue from 2022E onwards, our valuation would yield a €17.00 PT, implying c.-20% downside to the current share price. And, the current share price would imply 18x EV/EBIT and 27x P/E 2022E.

Our more constructive view is based on the share price now capturing the anticipated dilution and trading remaining benign for short-leisure (despite higher fuel prices and new COVID-19 variants). Meanwhile, our longer-term strategic/structural concerns remain: We still expect structural margin pressure and negative FCF for years to come due to upside pressure on costs and downside pressure on yields at the same time. ","Dilution now priced in easyJet has concluded its £1.2bn capital increase which, combined with the simultaneously issued $400m RCF, has boosted available liquidity to £4.4bn. In total, 301m new shares were issued, increasing the share count by ~66%. The offered discount to TERP was ~36%. The shares have priced in the anticipated dilution accordingly and are now trading below our previous £6.50 target price. Recent trading update confirmed positive booking trends For FY-21 (Sept-end), the company now expects a pre-tax loss of -£1.135m to -£1.175m (SFe: -£1.146m). For the current quarter (Q1-22) it plans to operate 70% of pre-crisis capacity (up from 58% in Q4-21). Restrictions in the UK have greatly eased and especially for the October half-term there have been strong bookings. We believe that confirms the general industry trend of short-haul leisure pent-up demand being released, which we think will continue, despite new COVID-19 variants and higher fuel prices. Given the company's attractive exposure to short-haul leisure (incl. easyJet Holidays), it will be a natural beneficiary. Our long-term concerns remain: We see yield pressure... We expect unit revenue ~6% below pre-crisis levels in the long run as easyJet's markets become increasingly competitive post COVID-19. The likes of Ryanair/Wizz Air have a lot of capacity to allocate in coming years. At the same time, legacy carrier capacity is unlikely to decline sufficiently to allow yields to remain stable, let alone increase. Ultimately, we believe all LCCs will focus on the same, limited growth opportunities that remain, e.g. Italy as ITA (formerly Alitalia) withdraws from short-haul routes and Portugal on TAP's restructuring. We note that with lower unit costs and stronger aircraft order book we see Ryanair/Wizz Air better placed to profitably capture such strategic opportunities. ..and cost pressure at the same time... At first glance, easyJet's cost measures look impressive (FTEs -30%, productivity +20%, renegotiated supplier contracts). The company has delivered £510m in cost savings this year, ~£250m of which it thinks is sustainable. However, we believe those ~£250m will be compensated by inflation in other parts of the business. E.g. the 58 sale-and-lease back transactions during the crisis (to secure liquidity) will alone add £140m in ownership costs. Furthermore, there will be higher navigation and airport charges in Europe (SFe: ~£70m), and higher financing costs on higher net debt (SFe: ~£40m). As a result, once capacity returns to pre-crisis levels (FY-23) we only see flat ex- fuel unit costs vs FY-19. Sustainably higher fuel costs would be an additional headwind (see page 3). ...resulting in lower margins, negative FCF and us being below consensus. While we slightly improve our FY-22 estimates to a pre-tax loss of -£204m (was -£261m) this remains below consensus (+£144m). We model post crisis pre-tax margins of ~5% (vs 7-8% pre-crisis). FCF will only turn positive by FY-24 (see page 4). Upgrade to Hold (Sell), price target down to 600p (650p). The shares now trade on 2023- based EV/EBITDA of ~6.2x (down from 8x earlier this year), i.e. more in-line with both, its historical average (6-7x) and Ryanair (6.7x). We upgrade to Hold (Sell), while our price target falls slightly to 600p (650p) on slightly better estimates, but slightly higher dilution from the capital increase.",Johannes Braun,"Johannes Braun, CFA, CIIA;Marc Zeck, CFA",600,650,Hold , set! ,GBP,-116.99,,-22.8,,0,0,,,,,M,STIFEL_Upgrade to_CoNote_Oct 25 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Upgrade to_CoNote_Oct 25 2021 01-00AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=0107e14d-81b8-4ecf-b980-8aa434e7b8c3&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
BAYN GY,BAYN,Dec 13 2021 11:17AM,Bayer,Pharmaceuticals,US Supreme Court takes a closer look at the Roundup litigation ,"As indicated in Bayer's Scenario 2 of last week's refresher on the glyphosatelitigation case, the US Supreme Court has asked the US Government to give an opinion on whether the court should listen to Bayer's bid to dismiss claims on Roundup. The Solicitor General, Elizabeth Prelogar, should come back in some months with an opinion. Bayer sees this outcome as positive and stops further settlements. ","In a first statement, Bayer welcomes the Supreme Court's decision. The company feels supported in its view that glyphosate is safe. The Solicitor General will probably ask the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which is responsible for the approval of crop protection products, for its opinion. As the EPA has repeatedly argued that glyphosate is safe and not cancer-causing, and with the approved ongoing marketing of the product, the probability that 9th Circuit Appeal, which affirmed the $25 payment to the plaintiff Hardeman on 14th May, might be overruled by the Supreme Court has materially increased. This would obviously have implications for all other litigation cases. Bayer's settlement resulted in payments of EUR 2.2bn in Q1-21. However, Bayer became much more selective in Q2 with just EUR 0.9bn payments and only EUR 0.6bn in Q3. After the Supreme Court's decision, the company stated today that it will ask for an opinion to not entertain any further settlements. In case of a positive outcome of the Supreme Court decision, Bayer could release most of the remaining glyphosate litigation provisions and the case could come to an end. Bayer has provisions for $6.5bn for future cases. There are still c. 30,000 inventory cases out of the 125,000 filed so far. Assuming average costs as paid in the settled cases so far, this represents round about $2.2bn. In addition, Bayer would realize cost savings related to lawyers and other items.",Andreas Heine,Andreas Heine;Isha Sharma,66,,Buy,,EUR,6.44,,6.94,,2,2.1,,,,,M,STIFEL_US Supreme_FlashCoNote_Dec 13 2021 11-17AM.pdf,STIFEL_US Supreme_FlashCoNote_Dec 13 2021 11-17AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=6f57c72d-f060-41fb-b3f7-69d6ea28cc49&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
DAI GY,DAI,Nov 01 2021 02:02AM,Daimler AG,Automotive,Very strong investment case: No Ifs or Buts ,"We increase both our 2022 and 2023 EPS forecasts by 2%. Mercedes Cars aswell as Daimler Trucks see record high book-to-bill ratios, and waiting time for many models goes into H2 2022. The latest price increases will thus be reflected in earnings in 2-3 quarters. Mercedes will increase prices again in January. We thus see little downside risk to earnings estimates. In our view, Daimler has the most shareholder-value focused management among peers and the highest cash conversion rate, and the stock is still trading at only 7x our 2022E EPS. We see little downside risk to multiples, as well. e@ If we do not see major bottlenecks in crucial components and materials next year, it is hard to see what could derail the investment case (and if we were to see such bottlenecks we would still prefer Mercedes among peers, as it generated an 8.5% EBIT margin in a quarter with 30% lower unit sales). We reiterate our Buy rating. Our SotP-based target price moves from EUR100 to EUR110. ","2022 profits already locked in? In Q3, Mercedes suffered from significant negative volume effects; we model some EUR1.6bn y-o-y headwind to earnings from the 30% decline in unit sales. However, in the EBIT bridge Daimler showed that the combined volume/price/mix effect was a positive EUR1.4bn for Mercedes. That would imply a positive effect of EUR3bn from higher prices and better mix - what a time to be a premium car manufacturer. The key question is: can pricing be sustained? At least for 2022, downside risks seem limited. Many cars are sold out until H2 2022. The strong pricing on cars sold today will only become visible in Q2, Q3 and Q4 of next year. Mix will certainly deteriorate, in our view. (S-class and SUV sales increased from 45% of total sales in Q3 2020 to 55% in 2021, and A-, B- and C-class sales declined from 38% to 29%). However, this means that Mercedes will still sell more of the high-end cars and the absolute EBIT should still increase; just the EBIT margin would be impacted. On the other side, we expect the volume effect and pricing will be positive. We forecast 12.8% EBIT margin for Mercedes next year - a record high level. However, we believe most of that is already locked in. No ifs or buts: In our view, among the German OEMs, VW has the biggest long-term upside, ifthey become a leader in BEVs and ifthey would consider asset sales. BMW has long-term strategy that protects against potential downside risks (exceptional strong balance sheet, flexible in terms of future technologies) - that could pay off if the market declines and ifhydrogen becomes an alternative to BEVs. In contrast to that, the Daimler investment case does not require many assumptions: 2022 profits are mostly locked in, and a 7x PE-ratio and 11% free cash flow yield are attractive. Daimler's management is focused on shareholder value creation, long term and short term. We believe that post the Truck spin-off, cash distribution to shareholders will become a main topic. Unlike for BMW and VW, we think that share buybacks are an option for Daimler; we discussed that in more detail in a recent note. Buy rating reiterated: Our SotP-based target price moves from EUR100 to EUR110 (see Figure 2). We value Mercedes with an EV/EBIT multiple of 4x on our 2022 estimates. This is below the 5x EV/EBIT multiple that we apply at Audi and BMW - reflecting that margins are at peak level. We value Trucks with 8x EV/EBIT (which implies some EUR26bn EV).",Daniel Schwarz,"Daniel Schwarz;Pierre-Yves Quémeéner;Alexander Wahl, CFA",110,100,Buy,,EUR,12.3,,12.8,,4.93,5.12,,,,,M,STIFEL_Very strong_CoNote_Nov 01 2021 02-02AM.pdf,STIFEL_Very strong_CoNote_Nov 01 2021 02-02AM,EARNINGS UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=e1bd4421-461b-4cda-9024-ad94d5b15121&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
JEN GY,JEN,Nov 25 2021 11:00AM,Jenoptik,Industrials,VINCORION sale sets Jenoptik straight for new strategic outlook at CMD next week ,"Jenoptik will hold a CMD next week, Tuesday 30 November and Wednesday 1December, to focus on group and segment strategy as well as a TRIOPTICS site visit. The sale of the VINCORION division marks a catalyst and starting point for the presentation of a new strategy, focusing on the photonics business. The sale also enables further improvements in group profitability and a strategy targeting sustainability after the defence business carve-out. We believe that the company will provide a strategic update for the period up to 2024 or 2025 with a focus on Light & Optics growth and increasing profitability. Please find respective notes for the group and the segments below. We believe that the CMD will act as a positive catalyst for the stock. ","On a group level we believe the company is targeting mid-20% margins going forward, compared with consensus of 20.2% currently (the VINCORION sale should increase group margins by 0.4pp, SFe). This should provide a further 10-20% upside potential to group margins. Furthermore, we believe that Jenoptik will outline how to achieve overall low to mid-teen organic growth going forward and what to expect on the M&A side. For segments in general, we are not sure whether to expect hard targets for revenue growth and EBITDA margins. We still outline what a potential target for each division could look like, but believe that focus will be on qualitative insights, statements and outlook. For Light & Optics, we expect insights into the TRIOPTICS integration and impact of the Berlin Glas Medical and SwissOptic acquisitions. Additionally, we believe that divisional management will shed light on expectations regarding the German and European ambitions around a regional semiconductor industry. This should be further emphasised by the recent government agreement in Germany that mentions the importance of the semiconductor industry. We also believe that Jenoptik will stress the importance of the Light & Optics segment, in line with our view that this is by far the most valuable part of the company. We believe this will be the most prominent part of the CMD and assume that management is aiming for EBITDA margins of between 25% and 30% over the medium term. In Light & Production, focus will likely be on the transformation in the automotive industry and how Jenoptik supports the industry in doing so. Divisional management will explain how to drive the integration and automation business in combination with an increased focus on laser applications. The management team already outlined that the new approach will come with slightly lower margins in general, but provides higher return on capital, due to a more asset light nature. We expect more details on that, which should help to ease concerns among investors regarding this development. Driven by economies of scale and optimisation, we assume management is aiming for stable margins in this segment. Finally, in Light & Safety we believe the company will focus on new developments in traffic safety and how Jenoptik intends to gain from that. Key will be a further focus on Safety as a Service we believe and the overall international expansion of that business. We believe that management is also aiming for stable margins in that business, which are hard to pin down anyway due to the project-driven nature of the business.",Florian Pfeilschifter,Florian Pfeilschifter,34,,Hold,,EUR,1.54,,1.65,,0.38,0.41,,,,,M,STIFEL_VINCORION sale_FlashCoNote_Nov 25 2021 11-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_VINCORION sale_FlashCoNote_Nov 25 2021 11-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=125287c0-c356-4b28-ac13-3180ebc8e2d4&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
SANT GY,SANT,Dec 17 2021 01:00AM,S&T AG,Technology Hardware,Waiting for management to comment in detail on another shortseller note ,"S&T's share price declined drastically on Thursday after the release of a newshortseller note. We do not intend to comment specifically on it, albeit appreciating that it is a public document, but formulate our view on a couple of aspects. Our recent initiation note was in particular assuming that the break-up between the loT divisions and the IT Services business, i.e. the potential sale of this segment should provide value for investors. We still think it should once the deal was happening. We indeed wait for management to officially comment further on the shortseller note and on the allegations brought forward. We think a similar reaction to a shortseller note in the past was quite professional and hope S&T will repeat giving an equally detailed answer as it did in October last year. At least the initial reaction on Thursday appears to be prudent without having emotions taking influence. As was mentioned in this press release, the company will take some time to fully assess all allegations and to come back with detailed comments and potential measures to reinstall confidence. Furthermore, S&T mentioned to be on track to meet the 2021 outlook. ","If you are a series acquirer you are probably susceptible As we pointed out in our initiation report (on page 19), the company was going through couple of different phases. So far, the business model has been linked a lot to buying distressed assets / restructuring cases. Surely, the intention was to lead the acquired entities eventually to higher valuation levels. Distressed assets are rarely perfect and due diligence processes are consequently there to assess the risk when buying into these assets. On page 37 in our initiation note we show the list of deals, and BASS Systems from Moldova was one where the due diligence has most likely not revealed risks adequately. BASS Systems was already sold however in the meantime. On page 20 of our initiation note, we mentioned that the exposure to other Eastern European countries may be on scrutiny - over and above the sale of the IT Services division. What about additional points? 1) Admittedly, we do have some question marks with what is called 'off balance entities’ in the shortseller note and hope to get additional insight on this from management explanations. 2) The previous FCF weakness of S&T is however not a secret and on page 26 in our note we show the OpFCF adjusted for the change in factoring for example. 3) Revenue declines of acquired entities is sometimes not an undesired occurrence, but deliberate act to end loss-making contracts. We believe that this is quite often the case in restructuring events. Reasonable re-assessment of the story can only be made once S&T releases further details to tackle the allegations Risk / reward can hardly be assessed at this stage and thus, we would not necessarily ‘puy the dip' today or tomorrow. We would rather risk having a weaker performance on potentially bit recovered share price once some confidence returns backed by a good management explanation relative to the allegations mentioned in the shortseller report on Thursday.",Adrian Pehl,"Adrian Pehl, CFA",30,,Buy,,EUR,0.9,,1.35,,0.19,0.3,,,,,M,STIFEL_Waiting for_FlashCoNote_Dec 17 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Waiting for_FlashCoNote_Dec 17 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=7b4c86a0-0ba5-47bd-9f95-137265406b17&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
HER IM,HER,Nov 02 2021 12:23PM,Hera,Utilities,Waste business would be the main driver for EBITDA growth in Q3-21 ,"Hera is publishing Q3/9M-21 results on 10 November. We expect that in Q3-21 thecompany would confirm the single-digit EBITDA growth historically reported in each quarter. We estimate that Q3-21 EBITDA would increase by 4% y/y, mainly driven by the waste and gas businesses. The waste business would benefit from increasing volumes, treatment prices and electricity prices. The gas business would benefit from the positive momentum in the energy efficiency services. Net profit would decline by 12% y/y, mainly due to higher DD&As linked to investments. Solid operating cash flow would determine a modest 2% increase in net debt versus end 2020, almost fully offsetting dividend payments, capex acceleration and cash-out for M&A in the period. ","We confirm our Buy rating on the stock. Hera's business model has proven highly resilient to the economic downturn determined by Covid19, and not it is positively exposed to economic recovery mainly through the waste business and increasing consumption of gas and electricity. We think that the low-risk growth offered by the company and the high quality of its management are underestimated by the current share price. The stock trades at attractive multiples both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Our detailed estimates for Q3-21 are as follows: EBITDA would grow by 4% y/y to €258m. We expect that in Q3-21 the main growth drivers would be represented by: 1) the waste business, whose EBITDA would increase by 15% y/y to €70m. The positive performance would be determined by recovery of waste volumes treated (mainly thanks to demand for treatment of special waste, linked to industrial production), continuing positive trend for waste treatment prices and higher selling price for the electricity produced by waste-to-energy plants; 2) the gas business, whose EBITDA would increase by 14% y/y to €56m, mainly driven by the energy efficiency business. We forecast that EBITDA from the water business would decline by 3% y/y to €76m, mainly due to rising electricity costs, and EBITDA from the electricity business would decline by 6% y/y to €45m, mainly due to lower sales to the ""salvaguardia"" customers. Net profit would decline by 12% y/y to €59m. Higher DD&As (linked to investment acceleration), financial costs related to the energy efficiency business and higher minorities would more than offset at the bottom line growth at EBITDA level. Investments would continue to accelerate. We estimate that capex would reach €165m in Q3-21, 8% higher than in Q3-20. Net debt would increase by a modest 2% versus end 2020 to €3.30bn.

We expect a confirmation of the current dividend policy. e We slightly cut our 2022-25 estimates, mainly due to a more gradual contribution from new businesses linked to energy transition. We raised our RAB estimates due to higher capex and the inflationary scenario. e Snam offers solid and visible value, in our view. Nevertheless we confirm our Hold rating, based on the modest upside offered by our new €5.25 price target. ","We expect a 7% increase of the 5-year capex in the new business plan. Snam is presenting its new business plan for the period 2021-25 on 29 November. We expect a continuity business plan, with the 5-year capex growing by 7% to €7.9bn (from €7.4bn in the 2020-24 plan). We expect that the increase would be determined by rolling-over till 2025 yearly capex both in gas transport and storage, and accelerating investments in new businesses linked to energy transition. We think likely that Snam would confirm the current dividend policy, based on 5% yearly increase in DPS till 2022, and 2.5% yearly growth thereafter. We slighly cut our EBITDA estimates, mainly due to more gradual contribution from new businesses. We raised our RAB estimates. We increased by 0.5% our RAB estimates as of 2022, mainly as a result of the current inflationary scenario and higher capex. We forecast an average 3.2% yearly growth in RAB in 2021-25. Our estimates for revenues remained broadly unchanged, while we reduced our 2022-25 EBITDA and net profit estimates on average by 3% per year, mainly due to slower than previously expected contribution from new businesses and higher corporate costs. +/-10bps variation in allowed returns versus our assumptions would determine +/-1.0% variation in our EBITDA estimates. Our estimates are based on the assumption of a 50bps reduction in allowed returns for gas transport and storage in 2022-24 versus the current levels (5.7% and 6.7% respectively). In 2025 we assume a further 20bps step-down, consistent with the graduality mechanism proposed by ARERA in the recent consultation document for the calculation of allowed cost of debt. Final allowed returns to be applied as of 2022 will be decided by the Authority by end 2021. We calculate that a +/-10bps variation in final returns versus our assumptions would determine an average +/-1.0% variation in our 2022-25 estimates at EBITDA level, and +/-1.5% at the bottom line. Solid value but modest upside. We confirm our Hold rating. We confirm our Hold rating on the stock. In our opinion, Snam offers solid and visible value thanks to RAB growth and value creation potential from non-regulated businesses driven by energy transition. Nevertheless, we struggle to see significant upside potential in the share price versus the current level. We raised our price target to €5.25 from €5.05. Our new price target offers 5% upside versus the current share price. According to our estimates, Snam trades at a 26% premium to RAB in 2021, declining to 18% in 2025. +/-10bps variations in final allowed returns versus our assumptions would determine a +/-0.04€/share variation in our price target.",Enrico Bartoli,Enrico Bartoli,5.25,5.05,Hold,,EUR,0.36,,0.33,,0.26,0.28,,,,,M,STIFEL_We expect_CoNote_Nov 23 2021 11-52AM.pdf,STIFEL_We expect_CoNote_Nov 23 2021 11-52AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=0a45e242-29c3-491d-a399-20f6515835fc&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

In 9M-21 it would grow by 23% yly, consistent with the full-year target. Net debt would increase by 5% versus end 2020, mainly due to capex acceleration, dividend payments in the period and increasing regulatory working capital. ","Our Buy rating on Terna is mainly based on the high visibility offered by the company on the value-creation potential driven by energy transition and electrification of the economy. We think that such potential is only partially valued in Terna's current share price. We think that the current share price underestimates Terna's RAB growth in excess of 6% per year. Visibility has improved on the potential for the company to continue growing RAB at similar pace also beyond 2025 after the recent 25% increase in Terna's 2021-30 plan for the development of the electricity transmission grid.

ELE SM,ELE,Oct 25 2021 12:51PM,Endesa,Utilities,"We expect a strong Q3-21, despite difficult market conditions ","Endesa is publishing Q3/9M-21 results on 3 November. We estimate that thecompany will report strong Q3 results, despite the difficult external environment determined by surging power prices in the Iberian market (wholesale power prices tripled versus Q3-20). On reported basis EBITDA we expect will increase by 22% y/ y and net profit by 21%. Endesa's hedging policy on the commodity side allowed to offset the negative impact on supply margins from high power prices. We estimate EBITDA in the non-mainland business will triple versus Q3-20, mainly thanks to the hedging policy on fuel costs. We expect that net debt will increase by 44% versus year-end 2020, due to dividend payments in the period, accelerating capex and surging working capital determined by delay in the invoicing process (to be recovered by year-end). ","Our Hold rating the stock is mainly based on the regulatory uncertainty determined by the unexpected regulatory changes implemented by the Spanish government in the past months, aiming at moderating the impact on electricity bills from rising gas and CO2 prices. The actual impact of gas and CO2 claw-back measures on Endesa is still uncertain, due to possible additional changes to the new regulation and the risk of extension of the gas claw-back beyond Q1-22, should the current scenario of high power prices continue. Our detailed estimates for Q3-21 are as follows: We estimate EBITDA will increase by 22% y/y on a reported basis, to €998m. On as adjusted basis (€213m of restructuring provisions were accounted in Q3-20), we estimate EBITDA will decline by a modest -3%, despite the adverse market conditions. 1) We expect that Endesa's hedging policy on commodities will offset the negative impact on supply margins from surging wholesale power prices. We forecast that EBITDA in the liberalized business will increase by 34% versus Q3-20. Commodity hedging should more than offset the negative impact from surging power prices in the Iberian market (which tripled to €118m in Q3-21 versus Q3-20) on Endesa's margins from its short-position in terms of power generation volumes versus sales to final customers; 2) We estimate EBITDA in the non-mainland business will triple versus Q3-20 to €126m, thanks to hedging on fuel costs and regulatory normalization; 3) We expected EBITDA from the electricity distribution business will decline by 3% y/y to €468m, mainly as a result of the declining allowed return. We expect Net profit will increase by 21% y/y to €464m. On as adjusted basis we believe it will decline by 16% versus Q3-20, mainly due to higher tax rate than in Q3-20. We estimate Net debt will increase by 44% versus year-end 2020, to €9.92bn. On top of dividend payments in the period, the surge in net debt will be determined mainly by accelerating capex (+31% versus 9M-20) and rising working capital, due to delay in the invoice process.

ENEL IM,ENEL,Oct 27 2021 01:00AM,Enel,Utilities,We expect resilient Q3-21 results ina difficult external environment ,"Enel is expected to publish Q3/9M-21 results on 4 November. We estimate thatQ3 EBITDA will remain flat on a reported basis at €4,050m, and it will decline by 7% on an ordinary basis. In our opinion, this would represent a resilient outcome, when considering the difficult external environment represented by surging power and gas prices in Italy and Spain, regulatory changes in Spain, and poor hydro conditions in Chile. Contribution to EBITDA is expected to derive from new renewable capacity. In Q3-21 Enel continued the positive trend in installing new renewable capacity, adding 1.0GW in the quarter. We estimate reported net profit will decline by 7% y/y to €910m. Net debt is expected to increase by 19% to €54.1bn versus year-end 2020, mainly due to dividend payments in the period, accelerating capex and the negative impact from forex on non-Euro denominated debt. ","We expect that Enel's results will confirm the resiliency of Enel's business to headwinds. In our opinion, Enel's share price has been excessively penalized in the recent months by the increased regulatory risk in Spain. In our opinion, the current share price is not properly reflecting Enel's value creation potential arising from its position as global leader in renewables and its exposure to energy transition. The stock trades at what we view as attractive multiples, and it offers visible dividend yields in excess of 5%. Our detailed estimates for Q3-21 are as follows: We estimate EBITDA will remain flat y/y on a reported basis at €4,050m. On an ordinary basis (mainly after stripping out the impact from the provisions accounted in Q3-20), we estimate it will decline by 7%. 1) EBITDA from Italy is expected to decline by 7% y/y to €1,855m, mainly due to the electricity distribution business, which benefited from extraordinary regulatory items in Q3-20. Power generation should remain flattish versus Q3-20, while the energy retail business should continue its positive trend; 2) We estimate EBITDA from Iberia will increase by 22% y/y to €988m. On an ordinary basis (net of the provisions accounted in Q3-20), we estimate it will decline by 4%. This would represent a positive outcome, in our opinion, when considering the negative impact on Endesa's supply margins from surging power prices, which was almost fully compensated by the company's hedging policy on commodities. We expect that Endesa's EBITDA will be already penalized by the application of gas claw-back measures at the end of the period; 3) We estimate EBITDA from Latin America will grow by 6% y/y to €1,017m. Tough comparison from forex stabilized in Q3-21. We expect that growth will result mainly from recovery in electricity demand, and despite unfavourable hydro conditions in Chile. Contribution to EBITDA growth in this area should also derive from the new renewable capacity; 4) We estimate EBITDA from North America will decrease by 46% y/y to €80m, mainly due to non-recurring items in Q3-20 and the expiration of some incentives in the US. We estimate Net profit will decline by 7% y/y to €910m. We expect that the bottom line will be impacted by €0.2bn costs arising from liability management and higher tax rate than in Q3-20. e@ Capex should continue to accelerate. We estimate that it will increase by 29% to €3.1bn versus Q3-20. We estimate Net debt will rise by 19% to €54.1bn versus year-end 2020. The increase is expected to be driven mainly by dividend payments in the period, accelerating capex and the negative impact from forex on non-Euro denominated debt.",Enrico Bartoli,Enrico Bartoli,9.2,,Buy,,EUR,0.52,,0.54,,0.38,0.4,,,,,M,STIFEL_We expect_FlashCoNote_Oct 27 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_We expect_FlashCoNote_Oct 27 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=4894f4c8-9a6d-497d-a6c8-5193b2095d31&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
A2A IM,A2A,Oct 28 2021 01:00AM,A2A,Utilities,We expect headwinds on A2A's power generation EBITDA in Q3-21 ,"A2A is publishing Q3/9M-21 results on 11 November. We expect that severalheadwinds would penalize EBITDA in the power generation business in Q3, while hedged volumes would not allow to fully exploit the favourable power generation scenario in the quarter. We estimate that power generation EBITDA would decline by 30% versus Q3-20, penalized by gas procurement costs, power volumes acquired at market price and rising concession fees for hydro plants. Q3 EBITDA would grow y/y by a modest 1%, despite positive performance in the other businesses. We estimate that net profit would decline by 31% versus Q3-20. Net debt would increase by 10% versus end 2020, mainly driven by capex acceleration, M&A and dividend payments in the period. ","We confirm our Hold rating on the stock. In our opinion, A2A's share price has quickly incorporated the new scenario of high power prices in the Italian market. Assuming a normalization of gas prices and consequently of Italian power prices as of 2023, we struggle to justify further significant upside in the share price versus the current level. In our opinion, A2A’s business plan also offers execution risk in terms of capital allocation due to A2A’s strategy aimed at building a large position in renewable power generation capacity. Our detailed estimates for Q3-21 results are as follows: EBITDA would remain flattish versus Q3-20 at €264m. 1) We expect that EBITDA in the power generation business would decline by 30% y/y to €53m. The positive impact on hydro margins from high power prices (which tripled versus Q3-20) would be mitigated by the company's hedging policy and weak hydro volumes in the quarter. Negative impact on EBITDA would derive from high gas procurement costs, pressure on margins from power volumes acquired in the spot market and rising fees for hydro concessions; 2) the negative performance in the power generation business would be offset by the positive performance from: a) the market division (we forecast EBITDA to increase by 10% y/y to €46m, mainly thanks to the continuing positive trend in volumes sold), b) the network division (we forecast EBITDA to increase by 10% y/y to €98m, mainly driven by the consolidation of Aeb-Gelsia) and c) the waste business, where we forecast EBITDA to increase by 17% y/y to €74m, mainly due to rising volumes treated and the positive impact on WTE margins from high power prices. Net profit would decline by 31% y/y to €45m, mainly due to rising DD&As resulting from accelerating capex. Investments would continue the sharp acceleration reported in the previous quarters. We forecast that capex in Q3-21 would increase by 72% y/y to €280m. Net debt would increase by 10% versus end 2020 to €3.83bn, mainly driven by capex acceleration, M&A and dividend payments in the period.",Enrico Bartoli,Enrico Bartoli,1.77,,Hold,,EUR,0.11,,0.13,,0.08,0.09,,,,,M,STIFEL_We expect_FlashCoNote_Oct 28 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_We expect_FlashCoNote_Oct 28 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=7dff7668-1894-450b-9f10-8424cb8fd080&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
ACE IM,ACE,Oct 29 2021 10:35AM,Acea,Utilities,We expect one more quarter of high single- digit growth ,"Acea is publishing Q3/9M-21 results on 10 November. We expect that Q3-21 wouldconfirm the high single-digit positive trend reported in the previous quarters. We estimate that EBITDA would increase by 8% y/y, net profit by 6%. We expect solid growth in all businesses. The main growth drivers would be represented by the energy infrastructure division (mainly thanks to the positive impact on hydro margins from high power prices in the Italian market), and the water business (thanks to tariff increases linked to accelerating investments). Net debt would increase by 12% versus end 2020, mainly due to dividend payments in the period and capex acceleration. ","Acea represents a value creation story mainly based on investment opportunities in its regulated businesses (water and electricity distribution). According to our estimates the company would offer average yearly growth in EBITDA of 6% in 2020-24. Visibility on such growth is in our opinion very high when considering the low risk of Acea's business portfolio and the strong delivery of Acea's management. Acea trades at lower multiples versus the other Italian local utilities and at large discount versus fully regulated utilities. Our detailed estimates for Q3-21 are as follows: EBITDA would increase by 8% y/y to €314m, confirming the high single-digit growth reported in the previous quarters. All businesses would post positive evolution. The main growth drivers would be represented by 1) the energy infrastructure division (EBITDA +12% y/y to €112m), which would also benefit from high power prices in the Italian market and 2) the water business (EBITDA +5% y/y to €161m), mainly due to tariff increases linked to accelerating investments. The trading&supply business would continue to benefit from increasing exposure to liberalized customers (EBITDA +10% y/ly to €22m). The waste business (EBITDA +19% y/y to €16m) would benefit from the consolidation of the companies acquired in the past quarters, increasing treated volumes and higher achieved power prices for the WTE plants. Net profit would increase by 6% y/y to €79m. Growth at EBITDA level would be partially offset at the bottom line by higher DD&As linked to capex acceleration. Investments would continue to grow, even if at a lower pace than in the previous quarters (to €220m).

AFX GR,AFX,Dec 10 2021 02:09AM,Carl Zeiss Meditec AG,Medtech,Weak end to the year and cautious outlook ,"AFX released Q4 results today, which are a miss on sales (-9.6% SFe; - 5.4% V.A.cons.) and EBIT (-23.6% SFe; -20.1% cons.). For FY21/22 the company expects revenue to grow at least to the same extent as the market (SFe: 10.2%; cons.: 9.8%, both FX adj.). The EBIT margin is projected between 19-21% (SFe: 23.1%; cons.: 22.2%). As expected, management increased the mid-term EBIT margin guidance to sustainably above 20% (before: above 18%), which, as usual, is highly conservative in our view. We expect an adverse share price reaction on this print today, but argue that the miss is mostly driven by phasing effects, while the structural growth story remains intact. ","We believe the miss today can be partly explained by persisting supply chain shortages, given the significant increase in the order intake to EUR 1,731m (+32.6% FX adj. y/y growth). Both segments missed expectations on sales. The weak profitability in OPT can be explained by product mix. In Q3 the company realised extraordinary high sales with gross profit accretive, single-use consumables. This resulted in somewhat less demand in Q4. To some extent, marketing costs also increased with the resumption of industry fairs in the U.S. Management will host an Analyst Conference today starting at 10:00 am CET. Besides the presentation of the annual report, the company will provide a deep dive into its cataract and digital strategy in OPT. Click here for the livestream presentation.

SNR LN,SNR,Dec 21 2021 01:00AM,Senior,Aerospace & Defence,What Justifies One-Third Off the Price? ,"We reiterate our Buy rating on Senior shares and our 200p price target (implying a66% TSR) following recent share price weakness. We include an ESG Assessment with this note. e Since their most recent high on 6 September, Senior shares have fallen by 33%, compared to -6% for the FTSE 250 Index and -8% for the European A&D sector (as measured by the Stoxx A&D index). e We view this as overdone: its Trading Update on 11 October was reassuring, as we wrote here, and whilst its CMD on 12 October left us wishing for more (discussed here), since 6 September, I/B/E/S median consensus EPS is almost unchanged. For FY-21, it is up +0.3p (the % is distorted by a base effect); for FY-22, it is down 2%; and for FY-23, it is up 1%. Importantly, Boeing appears to be picking up the pace of 737 MAX deliveries - a key programme for Senior. e@ Omicron may dent the air traffic recovery in December and in Q1-22, but the cyclical recovery remains intact, in our view, with remarkable order intake so far in December for Airbus and strong pent-up travel demand (as seen during summer 2021). We do not expect any of Senior's customers to change production rate plans, and as such, we see this stock price pull-back, with a 2023 P/E that is 4 turns below Civil Aero peers, as a clear buying opportunity. @ We regard Senior as a revenue, margin, and potential M&A turnaround story. Whilst we have no knowledge of any M&A discussions, our independent view is that Senior is likely to realise the value of its Aerostructures business unit (~25% of FY-20 group revenue) piecemeal over time, and that Lone Star, which made five approaches to Senior in May and June 2021, may not be the only party to be interested in the Company. It remains fundamentally an efficient A&D supplier, in our view, at a multiple that, whilst high relative to history, normalises rapidly beyond 2022. e In 2021 year-to-date, Senior shares are up 36%, vs +11% for the FTSE 250 index and +3% for the Stoxx A&D index. ","EPS Estimates Unchanged for 2021 & 2022 Our ""Adjusted EPS"" estimates are -0.5p (2021E, unchanged vs. -0.5p previously) and 3.0p (2022E, unchanged vs 3.0p previously). These estimates match the I/B/E/S median consensus for FY-21 of -0.5p and are slightly below consensus for FY-22 of 3.6p (though we do not read much into this - the delta vs consensus is just £2m at EBIT level) - our FY-23 estimate is 14% above consensus. Price Target Unchanged Our PT is 200p (unchanged vs 200p previously). It is derived from our FY-23 EPS estimate of 8.5p (up 5% vs 8.0p previously), plus a FTSE 250 market multiple of 16x (unchanged vs. 16x previously), plus a target P/E Relative of 150% (down vs 160% previously, due to risks relating to the omicron variant). 200p implies that in one year's time, Senior shares trade at 24x FY-23E EPS, which implies significant multiple contraction vs their current Forecast Year P/E of 41x FY-22E. This implies a TSR of +66% from current levels, including an estimated nil dividend for FY-21. Valuation and Next Event Senior shares currently trade at 41x our 2022E EPS estimate, falling to 14x 2023E EPS (vs European Civil Aero. mean of 25x, falling to 18x), which compares to its past-10-year mean of 19x. On EV/FCF, they trade at 46x 2022E FCF, falling to 19x 2023E FCF (vs peers on 33x 2022E / 21x 2023E).

LDO IM,LDO,Nov 03 2021 02:00AM,Leonardo SpA,Aerospace & Defence,What to Look for in 9M-21 Results ,"We reiterate our Buy rating and €10.50 price target (implying a +64% TSR) onLeonardo shares, and maintain our estimates ahead of 9M-21 results on the afternoon of Thursday, 4 November. Given the shares' recent underperformance (down -10% over the past month, vs +6% for the MIB40 index and -3% for the Stoxx A&D index), and our view that its 787 subcontractor issue that drove part of this underperformance is unlikely to be financially material, our bias is to buy ahead of the results. e@ Q3 appears likely to be typically seasonally weak for the P&L and for cashflow. We see slight upside vs consensus, with focus likely to be on the turnaround of Aerostructures (where Leonardo is to present its plan on Friday 5 Nov), and on the timing of the DRS IPO and other disposals. e We look for Q3-21 sales of €3,241m (up 3% y/y, driven by its Aircraft business as the Kuwaiti Typhoon contract ramps up, partly offset by deferrals of deliveries at Helicopters, which is closely in-line vs company-provided consensus of €3,229m), EBITA of €219m (or a 6.8% margin, which is 6% above consensus of €207m), and ""Free Operating Cashflow"" of €-291m, which is slightly below consensus of €-210m (though we do not read much into this). e@ We see Leonardo as a margin, cash flow and re-rating story at near-bottom-of- the-sector multiples (with minimal risk of an equity increase), and we look for validation of this thesis in the 9M-21 results. e So, aside from any update on FY-21 guidance (which we do not expect), we believe the key watch items are the turnaround plan for its problematic Aerostructures business, clarity on any financial implications (which we do not expect and which Leonardo has specifically denied) for the 787 quality issues attributed to its subcontractor, MPS, and comments on the timing of the IPO of DRS, its US defence electronics business, and the disposal of its automation business and any other businesses (e.g. Oto Melara or WASS). e YTD, Leonardo shares are up +9%, vs +22% for the MIB 40 and +12% for the Stoxx A&D. It trades at or close to the bottom of European A&D on most metrics, though at the lower-middle on FCF multiples, which we see as significantly over-discounted, given likely strong EPS (with a FY-20 to FY-23 CAGR of 51% from a depressed FY-20 base) and FCF recovery over the medium term, as well as deleveraging via disposals. ","Where Are We Different? For Q3-21, our revenue forecast is closely in-line vs company-compiled consensus, margins are +40bp above and EPS is €0.01 below; we do not regard these as significant. Looking at FY-21 / FY-22, we are in line with I/B/E/S consensus on revenue in both years, and in-line / +30bp above on margins. EPS Estimates Unchanged Our EPS estimates remain €0.90 for 2021E and €1.30 in 2022E. These are in-line with / +8% above current I/B/E/S median consensus of €0.90 and €1.21 respectively. Valuation and Next Event Leonardo shares trade at 5x 2022E EPS, and 4x 2023E EPS (vs. the European Defence Primes' mean of 12x / 11x). On EV/FCF, it trades at 17x 2022E FCF, falling to 10x 2023E FCF (vs Euro. Defence Primes' mean of 15x / 12x).

SAF FP,SAF,Oct 22 2021 01:00AM,Safran,Aerospace & Defence,What to Look for in Q3-21 Revenues ,"We reiterate our Buy rating and our €150 target price (implying a 37% TSR) onSafran shares, though we cut our FY-21E EPS and trim FY-22E EPS (leaving FY-23E unchanged) ahead of Q3-21 Revenues on Friday, 29 October. Given the shares’ recent slight underperformance (+1% over the past month vs +4% for the CAC 40 index and +3% for the Stoxx A&D index), our bias is to be buyers ahead of the results, given our conviction in improving narrow-body shop visits and aftermarket demand, benefiting from a good pace of recovery during the summer for short-haul traffic, and pent-up demand from deferred shop visits. e We anticipate that a strong pace of Q3 recovery for aftermarket (“AM”) has been well-flagged, and our estimates are in line with consensus. We look for Q3-21 sales of €3,719m (up 11% y/y, which is closely in line vs Visible Alpha consensus of €3,755m), and its key Propulsion segment Civil Aftermarket Revenue Growth in $ terms to be +39% y/y (benefiting from a weak Q3-20 comparator and sequential shop visit volume improvement - consensus is N.A.). e We still see Safran as a revenue and margin recovery story, benefiting from the faster pace of recovery of domestic and narrow-body traffic, and we look for validation of this thesis in the Q3-21 revenues. e The key watch items, in our view, are the pace of sequential improvement in Propulsion's Civil Aero AM revenues in Q3-21 and expectations for the pacing of recovery in Q4-21, trends in shop visit bookings and workscopes, LEAP engine delivery plans reflecting the slow MAX ramp and near-term de-stocking, and the pacing of a margin recovery in its Aircraft Interiors business. We do not expect any update to FY-21 guidance. e In 2021 year-to-date, Safran shares are down 6%, vs +21% for the CAC 40 index and +13% for the Stoxx A&D index. Safran trades around the high end of European A&D on earnings multiples (though around the middle on FCF multiples), which we see as justified by our forecast for a very strong EPS recovery CAGR of 43% (FY-20 to FY-23), benefiting from a depressed FY-20 base, and lower reinvestment requirements (and thus higher cash conversion). ","EPS Estimates Cut Our new ""Adjusted EPS"" estimates are €2.60 for 2021E, down 16% vs €3.10 previously, and €4.70 in 2022E, down 2% vs €4.80 previously. We leave FY-23 EPS unchanged. The FY-21 EPS cut is mostly due to previously-announced FY-21 impairments (€-0.34), and also to lower Cabin Interiors margins (€-0.17) and more conservative assumptions on margin expansion at Propulsion (€-0.15). The FY-22 EPS cut is mainly due to more conservative assumptions on margin expansion at Propulsion. These estimates are -7% below and +11% above current I/B/E/S median consensus of €2.81 and €4.25, respectively. Given that our estimate is 2% above FY-21 consensus at the EBIT level, we believe that the much larger and negative difference at the EPS level is mainly due to consensus not fully reflecting the impairments. Valuation and Next Event Safran shares currently trade at 24x 2022E EPS, falling to 18x 2023E EPS (vs the Euro. Civil Aero. mean of 29x / 19x). This represents a 2022 P/E Relative to the CAC 40 of 163%, which compares to its 10-year mean of 135%. On 2022E EV/FCF, it trades at 29x, falling to 23x 2023E (vs peers on 31x / 21x).

SRG IM,SRG,Oct 29 2021 11:28AM,Snam,Utilities,Y/y comparison in Q3-21 should be penalized by cost seasonality ,"Snam will publish Q3/9M-21 results on 4 November. For Q3-21 we expect thatrevenues would increase by 9% y/y, mainly driven by accelerating contribution from new businesses linked to energy transition. We anticipate a modest y/y decline at EBITDA level (-2% y/y) mainly due to cost seasonality and still limited contribution from new businesses. Net profit would remain flat versus Q3-20. Investments would continue to accelerate, consistent with Snam's business plan. Net debt would increase by 9% versus end 2020, mainly due to dividend payments in the period, capex acceleration and the acquisition of the stake in De Nora. ","Our Hold rating on Snam is mainly based on valuation. Snam trades at 24% premium to RAB in 2021 declining to 18% in 2024. We think that those multiples are not demanding, but our valuation is in line with the current share price. We expect that strong support to the share price would derive from a fully visible dividend yield growing from 5.3% in 2021 to 5.9% in 2024. Our detailed estimates for Q3-21 are as follows: Revenues would grow by 9% y/y to €749m. The main growth driver would be represented by non-regulated revenues, which we expect to grow by more than 80% to €89m, mainly due to accelerating contribution from new businesses linked to energy transition. Regulated revenues would increase by 4% y/y to €660m. EBITDA would decline by 2% y/y to €552m. The modest tough comparison would be mainly due to cost seasonality. We expect still limited contribution to EBITDA from new businesses. e@ Net profit would remain flat y/y at €292m.

HLAG GY,HLAG,Oct 29 2021 11:12AM,Hapag-Lloyd,Transportation,3Q21 prelims: Beat and Raise (and Repeat) ,Hapag-Lloyd released preliminary results for 3Q21 and raised the FY21 guidance.Both announcements came in significantly ahead of consensus expectations as freight rates continue to stay higher for longer than expected. ,"3Q21 preliminary EBITDA is expected to hit €3.3bn vs. company compiled consensus estimates (CCCe) of €2.4bn (22% beat) while 3Q21 preliminary EBIT is expected to reach €2.9bn vs. CCCe of €2.7bn (22% beat). With respect to FY21 results, Hapag-Lloyd lifted the FY21 EBITDA guidance to €10.1-10.9bn from €7.6-9.3bn previously. CCCe currently sits at €8.8bn. The company expects FY21 EBIT to come in between €8.7-9.5bn vs. CCCe of €7.4bn. According to the press release, the higher than expected 3Q21 results and the expected 4Q21 performance are driven by strong global demand for ocean transport and ongoing disruptions in global supply chains. The lower end of the FY21 EBITDA guidance (€10.1bn) implies that Hapag-Lloyd expects 4Q21 results to be as strong as preliminary 3Q21 results while the upper end suggests that 4Q21 EBITDA will be 25% higher than preliminary 3Q21 results. In our view, the strong guidance should alleviate investors' concerns that Hapag-Lloyd faces an immediate threat from lower spot ocean freight rates.

DSY FP,DSY,Oct 28 2021 03:16PM,Dassault Systemes,Software,3Q21 results: Momentum building up ,"Dassault saw robust demand in 3Q21, with software revenue up 11% on the backof licences up 24%. Also, Medidata revenue growth remained strong at +20% in 3Q, while 9M 3DExperience licences were up 36%. The operating margin was also significantly stronger than expected on the back of the top-line strength and lower travel costs and hiring. We believe the FY21 licence growth guidance raise for the third time this year suggests a more predictable, broad-based and faster-than-expected rebound in demand. e We expect these trends to continue in the coming quarters and forecast HSD licence revenue growth in FY22 and beyond. Furthermore, we expect 3DEXPERIENCE adoption to remain robust as large customers and their supply chains ramp up users on the latest version of Dassault’s software platform. We retain our Buy rating on Dassault and increase our target price to €55 (from €51). ","Sustained recovery across all regions/solutions Dassault’s organic licence growth remained robust in 3Q21 with licence revenue up 24% yly (2Q21-3Q20: +38% / +25% / -9% / -11% y/y). This strong performance in licences was across all geographies and solutions with DD growth in most end markets including core manufacturing industries — Transportation & Mobility, Aerospace & Defense and Industrial Equipment. Elsewhere, 3DExperience licences were up 36% y/y in CC and represented 38% of group licences in 9M21. The company continues to see significant traction in Life Sciences driven by market-share gains at Medidata (up 20% y/y). We continue to expect sustained robust demand on the back of increased adoption of 3DExperience in the coming quarters and forecast its contribution to group software revenue to increase in the medium-term as large customers and their supply chains ramp up users on the latest version of Dassault’s software platform. FY21 guidance raised again, FY licences now up 21-22% Dassault raised its FY21 total revenue guidance to €4,800-4,825m (€4,745—4,790m previously). Within this, FY21 licences are now expected to grow by 21-22% in CC (19-21% previously). More importantly, Dassault also raised its FY21 operating margin guidance to 34.0-34.1% (32.7-33.1% previously) resulting in FY21 EPS guidance of €0.94-0.94 (€0.89-0.91 previously). Note that the FY21 op. margin guidance implies an ex. Medidata margin improvement of c.430 bps (vs. FY20 / FY19 / FY18 / FY17: +70 / +100 / +70 / +100bps). Furthermore, management opined that FY22 op. margins should drop lower by 1.0—1.5% points, or 32.5—33.0% on the back of increased travel and marketing costs and hiring. Given it is rather early to comment on FY22 profitability and Dassault management's historical conservatism, we view this guidance as reasonable.

ATO FP,ATO,Oct 22 2021 03:26PM,Atos,IT Services,3Q21 review: disruption ahead of transition ,"Inthe post-COVID world, we believe Atos’ top-line and profitability will continueto face headwinds from the accelerated decline in the legacy infrastructure business from the migration to the cloud, which is likely to be further exacerbated by Atos' divestment plans and the imminent CEO transition. We also expect most of the drivers of the mid-term margin guidance to be more back-end loaded. e Furthermore, we believe the accelerated structural headwinds and weak outlook for these ‘for-sale’ businesses makes them particularly unattractive and the divestment could potentially be a long-drawn process and remain an overhang on the shares in the meantime. e Despite the tempting valuation (10.8x/9.6x our 2021/22E EPS), we continue to stay on the sidelines. We retain our Hold rating on Atos and increase our DCF- based target price to €46 (from €44) on our revised estimates. ","We remain cautious on Atos in the mid-term In the post-COVID world, we believe Atos' revenues will continue to be impacted by the accelerated decline in the legacy infrastructure business from the migration to the cloud, further exacerbated by the company's plan to divest the business. This top-line headwind should also significantly increase the pressure on profitability. The Infrastructure & Data Management (IDM) division's revenues should be down c.11%, representing c.47%% of group revenues in FY21E: this division is split between the Classic Infrastructure business (c.45% of IDM, down c.20%) and the Classic Application business (c.55%, down c.4%). Apart from the German restructuring, we believe the remaining drivers of the medium-term op. margin guidance of 11%-12% should be more back-end loaded, given it mostly depends on the natural evolution of the business, on the increase of offshoring and on the completion of the planned divestment. Divestment and CEO transition to be an overhang in the near term Atos is looking to divest — (1) the datacentre hosting and associated activities (~€1.2bn revenues and ~0% margin), (2) Atos Unified Communications & Collaboration (UCC, ~€0.6bn revenues and ~6% margin), and (3) sub-critical activities (~€0.3bn revenues with a low margin) — together representing c.20% of FY21 group revenues. We believe the accelerated structural headwinds faced by these businesses make them particularly unattractive for potential acquirers. This, coupled with Atos' failure to divest Unify (a large part of UCC) in 2016/17, suggests that the process could be potentially long and tricky and remain an overhang on the shares in the meantime. However, management noted that it is in advanced discussions on the Unified Communications & Collaboration while formal process has been launched for the Datacentre hosting and associated activities and the company has received multiple indications of interest. We also expect disruption ahead of new CEO's strategy update after he takes office in January 2022. Valuation and catalyst Atos is scheduled to report its 4Q21 results on February 28.

SAP GY,SAP,Oct 22 2021 02:19PM,SAP SE,Software,3Q21: Cloud KPIs drive confidence in FY22 ,"We remain optimistic on Cloud revenue acceleration in 4Q21 and FY22 onthe back of the strong 3Q Current Cloud Backlog (with S/4HANA backlog up 58%), management's optimistic commentary on S/4HANA rev momentum, increasing large deal 'RISE with SAP"" pipeline, and consistent recovery at Concur. Furthermore, we expect these large RISE opportunities to close in 4Q resulting in a bounce in S/4HANA CCB in 4Q and should also add a significant tailwind to FY22 Cloud growth as workloads from these RISE customers move to S/AHANA Cloud. e@ Given 9M Cloud & Software revenue growth (+6% y/y) is already standing ahead of the updated FY21 guidance (2-4%), our expectation of a Cloud acceleration and stable maintenance evolution in 4Q lead us to believe that FY21 guidance ‘Is conservative. e SAP's recurring businesses are still worth €140 per share (Maintenance / Cloud: €50 / €90 per share). We retain our Buy rating on SAP and raise our price target to €150 (€140 previously). ","Key Cloud KPIs accelerate driving confidence in FY22 As the migration of legacy on-premise ERP customers to the Cloud ramps up with 'RISE with SAP’, we expect the headwind on licence revenue to be increasingly offset by Cloud revenue acceleration. Especially, given the — (1) Current Cloud Backlog (CCB) acceleration (+22% y/y in CC in 3Q21, thereof +58% at S/4HANA, with large deals coming in 4Q), (2) management's optimistic commentary on significant Cloud CCB and rev acceleration in 4H and FY22 and large deal 'RISE with SAP’ pipeline, easier comps and improving transaction volumes in the pay-as-you-go business (Concur already up in MSD), we expect Cloud revenue growth to accelerate further in 4Q21 and FY22. We forecast Cloud revenues to grow by 22% y/y in CC in 4Q, vs. 17% in 9M. Furthermore, we expect large deals/volumes to move to S/4HANA Cloud in 4Q resulting in a bounce in S/4HANA and group CCB, which should alleviate investors concerns on the pace of the business model transition at SAP. FY21 guidance remains conservative on the back of volatile licences While SAP management raised its FY21 guidance for the third time this year, we continue to believe it's conservative. Given the 9M21 Cloud+Software rev growth of 6% y/y in CC, SAP's FY21 guidance translates to a slight decline in Cloud+Software rev in 4Q. Furthermore, the stable maintenance growth and accelerating Cloud growth implies a particularly conservative licence growth assumption (>30% decline) in 4Q, vs. 9M21 licence growth of -6% y/y in CC. We forecast Cloud & Software revenue growth of 4% in 4Q, resulting in FY21 growth of 5% in CC. Elsewhere, we expect more large RISE opportunities deals to close in 4Q and their workloads to ramp up in FY22, which should provide upside risks to FY22 consensus expectations.

SAP has increased its recurring rev from 41% of total rev in 2008 to 72% in 2020 (75% in 2021E). Within this, Cloud rev should grow by c.18% in CC in FY21, progressively improving through the year with 4Q21 growing by 22% y/y in CC, while maintenance should continue to be up 1% due to weak licences in the past couple of years.

ALTUV FP,ALTUV,Nov 02 2021 01:52PM,BIO-UV Group,Industrials,FLASH NOTE Acquisition of Corelec and sales warning ,"Conclusion: as expected for some months now, Bio-UV announced on October 29the acquisition of Corelec, a French firm specialized in water disinfection based on the electro-chlorination technology. With an EBITDA margin of more than 30%, we believe this deal would be strongly margin-accretive for Bio-UV. Given the successful integration of Triogen (acquired in September 2019), we view this announcement positively, as the Group should be able to generate operational and commercial synergies. But, in the meantime, Bio-UV announced that it will not achieve its guidance of a ""double-digit"" growth in revenues in FY-21, mainly due to difficult momentum in Maritime activities. We'll update our estimates after we have more information on Corelec's financials. ","Acquisition of Corelec: on October 29, Bio-UV announced the signing of an acquisition agreement for the takeover of 100% of the capital of Corelec, a French company located near Toulouse (Haute-Garonne). The firm specializes in swimming pool water disinfection using electro-chlorination technology, and sells pH regulation systems under the brand ""Akeron"". Corelec has 25 employees and has a design department and an assembly unit. Corelec's financials imply a margin-accretive deal: in the first nine months of 2021, Corelec's revenues reached €10m, y/y growth of 93%. Around 90% of revenues are located in France. EBITDA margin stood at more than 30%, versus the latest communicated margin of 12.6% for Bio-UV (H1-21 figure). Deal terms: deal is expected to close no later than November 9. Purchase price was not communicated. As per the acquisition agreement, Corelec's major shareholder, Loic Le Ravallec, would join the Management Board of Bio-UV and lead the integration of Corelec. FY-21 sales guidance is cut: Management indicates that the FY-21 guidance of ""double-digit"" growth in revenues will not be met, mainly because of Maritime activities. Indeed, Q4-21 sales in the segment display weaker-than-expected momentum. Strong economic recovery globally has put ship-owners under pressure, forcing them to delay projects to install ballast water management systems to later years (2022-23-24) in order to focus on the optimization of their fleet utilization rate. However, land-based activities continue to experience good momentum, which we contend should materialize with the integration of Corelec. FY-21 EBITDA margin guidance unchanged: Bio-UV continues to expect an improvement in EBITDA margin versus FY-20, excluding the margin-accretive impact of Corelec. As a reminder, in H1-21, Bio-UV displayed record-high profitability with an EBITDA margin of 12.6% vs 9.1% in H1-20.",Martin Tessier,Martin Tessier,7.3,,Buy,,EUR,0.14,,0.16,,,,,,,,M,STIFEL_Acquisition of_FlashCoNote_Nov 02 2021 01-52PM.pdf,STIFEL_Acquisition of_FlashCoNote_Nov 02 2021 01-52PM,SPONSORED RESEARCH,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=b2f1be88-e6ca-4ac2-ab57-914fe132ae20&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

ISN SW,ISN,Dec 23 2021 01:00AM,Intershop,Real Estate, Another proof of conservative valuation approach ,"Intershop announced yesterday after closing (press release here) that it haspublicly notarized the sale of its property 'Hohlstrasse 190+192' in Zurich to an institutional investor (name was not disclosed) for CHF 114m. The net gains from property disposals (pre-tax) amounts to CHF 80m and will be booked in 2021. Following a company contact we conclude that the company has not yet decided what to do with the substantial proceeds (c.CHF42/share (pre-tax); 7% of the current market cap). Given the above-average dividend yield we believe the company could favor to reinvest the funds in its strong development pipeline. The transaction is another proof how conservative Intershop's valuation approach is. Furthermore, management proves once again the long-standing success of its value-added investment strategy with (1) high cashflow from rental activities and (2) additional income from development and sales. ","The office property 'Hohlstrasse 190+192' was built in 1985 and covers an area of 3,884m2. According to the 2020 annual report, the total rentable area amounts to 8,236m2, whereof 49% is office, 35% industrial/storage and 13% retail. The end-2020 vacancy rate was 1.3% and the target rent CHF 1.9m. The office property 'Hohlstrasse 190+192' is located next to the new Police and Justice Centre Zurich (PJZ) and offers considerable development potential, which partly explains the high price tag of CHF 29,351/m2. e@ On 28 April 2021, we downgraded Intershop to Hold from Buy, as 2021 was in our view a transition year for the company (link here). With its H1-21 results published on 24 August the company expected to reduce the 2021 vacancy rate to slightly below 11% at the end of 2021 (est.: 10%). Excluding additions and disposals, rental income should remain stable in H2-21 and rise again from 2022 onwards. This will be harder to achieve now that the company has sold Hohlstrasse 190+192 (rental income c.CHF 1.9m). Intershop continues to monitor the transaction market. Provided that the effects of the pandemic do not have an unexpected negative impact on H2-21, Intershop again expects to achieve a good FY-21 result, which should enable it to maintain its attractive dividend policy.

LNZ AV,LNZ,Nov 03 2021 03:39AM,Lenzing,Chemicals,Costs weigh on profitability but guidance reiterated ,"Lenzing confirmed its full-year EBITDA guidance of at least €360m despite thecontinued raw material and energy headwinds. This compares with our estimate of €379m and consensus of €396m, which in our view look outdated and do not reflect the raw material and energy cost headwinds. The guidance implies Q4 EBITDA of >€60m. The VSF saw a jump in prices in October, driven by reduced Chinese production. The lower demand for dissolving wood pulp resulted in a slight decline in prices. VSF operating rates in China dropped to 56% (vs five-year average of 80%). However, inventory levels are still high (27 days, above long-term average of 19 days). In this uncertain and volatile environment, we see the guidance as reasonably cautious. ","Q3-21 results: Lenzing reported group EBITDA of €80m, lower than our forecast of €91m. The sequential decline in margin by 8% q/q is explained by lower prices but strong raw material, energy and logistic cost inflation. Progress on important projects: The two large investment projects, the 100kt Thailand lyocell plant and the 500kt DWP plant in Brazil (scheduled for Q2-22), remain fully on track. Commissioning of the lyocell plant should be achieved by year-end and ramped up in H1-22. The Brazilian DWP plant is on schedule and should achieve full run-rate by end-2022. Operating cash flow was strong in Q3 at €108m, increasing by €20m q/q and almost back to the peak level of Q1. Net debt increased during Q3 from €0.7bn to €0.8bn, reflecting the negative FCF of -€94m in Q3. Capex is still around €200m as in the preceding four quarters. However, excluding the third-party share for the Brazilian DWP plant, net debt is €0.5bn and increased only marginally q/q. The Lenzing net debt definition does not include the hybrid bond of €0.5bn.

MUX GY,MUX,Nov 11 2021 01:00AM,Mutares SE & Co KGaA,Industrials, Deal activity set to remain on high levels ,"Overall, 3Q21 results confirm our investment case. Consulting revenues grew by~55% yoy to €35.6m, fully in-line with our forecasts. This implies a 3Q21 top-line contribution from consulting services of €12.8m, an increase of ~59% yoy. Net income of the holding came in at €17.6m. MUX continues to execute on its growth strategy as it announced portfolio acquisition number 11 on 9 Nov, which brings the total number of portfolio companies to 20. The guidance was confirmed on all levels, i.e. FY21E group revenues of >€2.4bn and FY21E holding net income of €43-53m. Our forecasts stand at €2.53bn and €45.7m, respectively. MUX also continues to target a dividend on at least the level of FY20, i.e. a DPS of at least €1.50. In our view, this reads conservative. We estimate that the financial performance of the holding should cover a base DPS of €1.75. Beyond that, the company is well capitalized post the recent cap increase and six successful exits since the beginning of the year. Moreover, according to the CIO, MUX is in advanced negotiations to sell another two portfolio companies. Hence, we are of the view that the vast majority of exit gains should be distributed to shareholders, which may leave room for upside surprise on total dividend pay-outs. Our FY21E DPS forecast stands at €1.75, which compares to Refinitiv consensus of €1.62. ","e@ MUX M&A teams continue to fire on all cylinders. On 9 November, the company announced the acquisition of Allianceplus AB, based in Sweden, a new platform investment in its Goods & Services segment. The company generated ~€27m in revenue in FY20 and, in our view, shows that MUX has established itself as leading private equity provider for special sits transaction in the Nordics. This marks the company’s ""1"" acquisition YTD, which shows the strong momentum in the private equity market for special sits. e@ The deal pipeline for the remainder of the year appears to be well filled. In the results CC, MUX’ CIO indicated that the company is in the final stage of closing an add- on acquisition for SFC Solutions in the Automotive segment, which could potentially catapult EBITDA margins of the business from ~2% to 8% by FY24. Moreover, MUX’ CIO indicated that parts of the cash injection from the cap increase could potentially be invested “before Christmas”, which may signal the execution of a larger deal until year end. The success on the M&A front continues to be reflected in the financial performance on the holding level. Consulting revenues came in at €35.6m, which implies €12.8m in Q3, fully in-line with our forecast, which stood at €13.0m. This implies growth in what we believe is the most important part of MUX' business as it is largely of recurring nature and as it offers the highest degree of visibility. The number of consultants increased to 82 FTEs, up from 70 at the end of December 2020. While the overall portfolio is expanding, it is important to note, that management continues to deliver on its promise to reduce the overall holding period of its investments. This is reflected in six exits since the beginning of the year, of which the sale of STS Group has the biggest impact on the group’s financial performance. Going forward, we understand that MUX is in advanced negotiations to sell two of its portfolio companies, Brexity and keeper, which generated sales of ~185m and ~ €100m in FY20, respectively. We also note that Donges Group, a company, which we estimate will generate ~€400m in sales and €25-30m in EBITDA in FY21E, may be sold within the next 12 months, an event, which, in our view, would trigger significant exit gains and subsequent payments of extra dividends. Holding net income amounted to €17.6m in Q3, which significantly exceeded our forecast of €11.1m, largely driven by the gains from the sale of STS Group, which contribuetd ~€25m to the bottom line. This leaves ~€5m of net income in Q4 to reach the lower end of the company’s guidance or ~€8m to reach our forecast of €46m, which we find very feasible.",Benjamin Kohnke,Benjamin Kohnke,30,,Buy,,EUR,,,,,1.75,2.4,,,,,M,STIFEL_Deal activity_FlashCoNote_Nov 11 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Deal activity_FlashCoNote_Nov 11 2021 01-00AM,FLASH NOTE ,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=1e376931-4f9d-49c6-a57f-97e394dc1486&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

SHF GY,SHF,Oct 29 2021 06:00AM,SNP SE,Software,FY21 more back-end loaded than expected ," SNP published mixed 3Q21 numbers with sales increasing 22% y/y (organic:7%) and a weak order entry that was down 15%, partly due to a high comp base. e@ The company specified its outlook towards the lower end of the previous wide range, now seeing sales of €170-180m (previously €170-190m) and EBITDA of €18-22m (vs €18-24m). The updated guidance still implies strong growth in Q4 (>35%) and a high margin of >20%. e We update our estimates after the latest results and include the recent M&A transactions. We expect an acceleration of sales and earnings as well as a material improvement of the order entry, which could exceed €200m by year- end. e Our ESG analysis yields solid results with room for improvement. We note positive developments since the beginning of this year. e We reiterate our Buy rating with a new price target of €61 (€73). Our EPS estimates come down, mainly on PPA effects from recent M&A deals and lower profitability assumptions. ","3Q21 numbers were mixed ... Sales came in at €46m, up 22% y/y, with a positive impact of €5.8m from the acquisitions of EXA and Datavard. The organic growth rate thus stood at 7% in Q3. EBIT was at €2.9m for a margin of 6.3% after €5m last year (margin: 13.2%). According to management, the company incurred one-off expenses related to M&A deals of €1.3m. Order entry is the weak point in the set of results, in our view, as the number declined by 15% y/y to €40m. Order backlog is still at a high level at €135.5m after €110.8m at the end of 2020. A key reason for the sluggish development in Q3 is a very high comparison base from last year, when a large deal with a global system integrator boosted the order entry figure. Since 2021, SNP has closed fewer partner deals with pre-defined sales volumes so that the financial impact is only recognised later and the order entry increase is also delayed. On segment basis, the high comp base becomes even more apparent. Service revenues were up 56% y/y to €21m, while Software revenues declined by 21% to €13.1m. Sales from EXA AG were initially recognised in the Services segment. The company will review if at least part of the sales should be allocated to the Software segment. ... but Q4 should see a dynamic acceleration After the downward adjustment of the guidance to €170-180m sales, €18-22m EBITDA and an EBIT margin of 5% to 7% (was €170-190m / €18-24m / 5% to 8%), management still expects a strong performance in Q4. The implied growth rate is >35% at an EBITDA margin of >20%. CEO, Michael Eberhardt mentioned several slipped deals, of which at least two larger ones should be closed in Q4. Also, partner business is gaining momentum. After SNP has built up a strong network of global partners over the past two years, focus will now shift towards partner enablement and execution of migration projects with partners. The partnerships closed this year did not come with pre-defined volumes anymore, which should be supportive for mid-term growth, in our view. Valuation and catalysts SNP trades at 74.7x / 24.2x our 2021E / 2022E EPS vs. European IT services at 22.8x / 20.7x and European software at 34.5x / 30.9x. Next catalysts should be an increase in partner business activity and an acceleration of growth dynamics in Q4 and into 2022. Main risks come from cautious customer demand and a general downturn in the S/4HANA adoption wave, which remains an important tailwind for the next years.",Yannik Siering,Yannik Siering,61,73,Buy,,EUR,0.64,,1.99,,0,0.4,,,,,M,STIFEL_FY21 more_CoNote_Oct 29 2021 06-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_FY21 more_CoNote_Oct 29 2021 06-00AM,EARNINGS UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=a6129b54-23a6-4998-a095-959216fbe8ea&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
RIEN SW,RIEN,Oct 27 2021 01:08AM,Rieter,Capital Goods,Gaining ground on (previously) out-of-reach strategic priorities ,"Ongoing very strong order momentum in Q3-21 triggered higher earningsestimates for FY-22 and FY-23 from our side. Together with the large Egyptian order in 2019 (CHF 210m, recognised in FY-22/23) and the acquisition of Saurer activities, FY-22E and FY-23E should see a significantly higher top line. e Since the setting of its medium-term financial targets in FY-14, Rieter has never been close to its EBIT margin goal of 10% (based on a sales level of CHF 1.3bn). We now expect Rieter to reach an EBIT margin of 9.0% in FY-22E and 9.9% in FY-23E (post integration costs and PPA in connection with the takeover of the Saurer activities). e Our unchanged valuation approach defines a price target of CHF 270.00 per Rieter share. We reiterate our Buy rating. ","Extraordinary 9M21 order intake and backlog promised for FY-22 and FY-23 The extraordinary order intake increase of 290%, to CHF 975m in H1-21, was itself topped by order momentum of +301%, to CHF 699m in Q3 (excluding business from the Saurer activities and despite higher comps). The Machines & Systems backlog covers 18 months, whereas Components stands at six months. In total, Rieter booked an order backlog of CHF 1,562m as of September 2021. In the 9M21 order intake conference call, CEO Norbert Klapper commented that he had not experienced any cancellation discussions with customers but rather requests for faster deliveries. Hence, customers are booking earlier than usual due to long lead times. There is no double-booking, however, according to Dr Klapper. FY-22E and FY-23E sales assumptions of CHF 1.62bn and CHF 1.69bn should push EBIT margin towards medium-term target of 10% The combination of optimised cost base with reduced workforce in Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands and/or shifted production from Germany to the Czech Republic, and significant higher sales of CHF >1.6bn (including the acquired Saurer activities) should enable Rieter to achieve an EBIT margin close to the medium-term target of 10% (even after additional integration costs and PPA in connection with the acquisition of the Saurer activities). Limited FX exposure With the exception of FY-11 (c.-5%), the negative FX impact at the sales level has always remained below -2%. This is because 75% of Rieter’s business is factored in CHF, 20% in EUR and only 5% in other currencies (CNY, INR, USD). Therefore, the depreciation of the Turkish lira does not affect Rieter's top line (despite sales exposure of c.20%). Unchanged valuation approach sets new price target: CHF 270.00 (from CHF 260.00) Our price target of CHF 270.00 (previously CHF 260.00) is based on our DCF model (weight: 50%, unchanged), peer group valuation multiples of Swiss Industrials with similar growth volatility and international machinery companies (EV/EBIT multiple of FY-22E, total weight: 50%, unchanged). Our adjustments for the acquisition of Saurer activities (only consolidated from FY-2022E onwards and not for four months in FY-21E) and earnings estimates revisions on the back of the outstanding order intake in 9M21E have had a slightly positive impact on our DCF valuation and peer group valuation multiples.",Christian Arnold,Christian Arnold,270,260,Buy,,CHF,4.77,,23.4,,1.5,7,,,,,M,STIFEL_Gaining ground_CoNote_Oct 27 2021 01-08AM.pdf,STIFEL_Gaining ground_CoNote_Oct 27 2021 01-08AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=34a37410-a057-49e3-9ee6-7b823f95b1cf&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
MUX GY,MUX,Nov 05 2021 02:01AM,Mutares SE & Co KGaA,Industrials,Going for the big fish — price target raise to €30 ,"impressively, MUX management has shown flawless execution with its strategic andfinancial targets over the past 12 months. e@ Going forward, MUX will even step up a gear as it expands its TAM. The company feels well positioned to target significantly larger investments, a view we share, especially against the backdrop of ~€95m of net proceeds from the recent capital increase. e While we concede that the strategy comes with higher risks, higher returns should more than compensate for that. e We significantly raise our holding income and earnings estimates, which should trigger continued attractive dividend payouts as we forecast FY21E and FY22E DPS of €1.75 and €2.40, respectively. e We raise our target price for the stock to €30 (up from €22). ","At its recent CMD, MUX management announced that it would step up a gear and target significantly larger acquisitions in the coming years. As this strategy requires ""more skin in the game"" from private equity buyers, MUX conducted a capital increase, which was successfully completed in October and led to net inflows of ~€95m. Against the backdrop of a strong track record over the last 24 months, which transformed the company into a leading private equity company with a focus on special situations across Europe, and the increased M&A firepower, we see MUX well positioned to execute on its strategic goals. The company has set out aggressive new targets, which should catapult aggregated revenue from its portfolio companies to more than €5bn in FY23E. This requires additional revenue of ~€1.2bn in FY22E and FY23E, which, at this stage, may appear stretched. However, in our view, the acquisition of Lapeyre in France, which should add an estimated €600m in revenue and required a cash injection of ~E20m by MUX, proved that MUX management can walk the talk. The current market environment should provide continued tailwinds to MUX special situations strategy and trigger constant deal flow. Hence, we adjust our estimates for group revenue accordingly and now forecast €4.4bn and €4.8bn in FY22E and FY23E, respectively. Revenue on the holding level should be boosted by an aggressive expansion of the company's consulting teams, which have grown to ~100 FTEs. MUX plans to double the number of consultants on the platform to ~200 by end-FY23E. Asa result, we expect revenue and net income from consulting services to grow to €49.5m and €24.6m, respectively. Adding regular dividends from portfolio companies should result ina FY22E net income from management fees of €40.6m, which would mark a remarkable increase of ~37% vs. our FY21E estimates. We understand that MUX will maintain its commitment to an attractive dividend policy. Our bottom-up analysis concludes that MUX should be in a position to pay a base dividend from management fees of ~€2.0 per share in FY22E. This could go up to ~€2.8 in FY23E. MUX demonstrated its ability to execute on exits over the past 24 months. Hence, we add an extra DPS of €0.50 (mainly stemming from the disposal of STS Group) and €0.75 in FY21E and FY22E to our forecasts. e@ We value MUX ona mix of DDM (DPS of €2.0; g = 1.5%) and peer group analysis with number of European private equity companies as constituents. The latter approach is based on a FY22E P/E target multiple of 14x. Main risks to our investment case include the failure to identify the right investment targets and a longer-than-expected time to restructure portfolio companies.",Benjamin Kohnke,Benjamin Kohnke,30,22,Buy,,EUR,,,,,1.75,2.4,,,,,M,STIFEL_Going for_CoNote_Nov 05 2021 02-01AM.pdf,STIFEL_Going for_CoNote_Nov 05 2021 02-01AM,COMPANY UPDATE ,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=cdb271cc-9fbc-4c7d-84f7-3069ceff4a73&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
PHN IM,PHN,Oct 27 2021 01:00AM,PharmaNutra, Pharmaceuticals,Healthy quarter in sight ,"Ahead of 9M-21 results on 8 November, we raise our EPS estimates forFY-21/22/23E, on average, by 3% and our PT to €88 (from €80), expecting a strong delivery in Q3-21. e The latest news flow, namely the entry into four new countries in South East Asia and the Middle East and the grant of Cetilar patent in India, provides further appeal to the equity story and raises visibility on the mid-term forecasts. e Thanks to multiple organic growth opportunities, PharmaNutra is well-placed in a steadily growing industry. Furthermore, its strong balance sheet leaves room for M&A, providing yet another catalyst not factored into our valuation model. ","Further sales acceleration is expected in Q3-21. PharmaNutra will report its 9M results on 8 November. We expect a sharp sequential acceleration of net sales growth in Q3, to +47% Y/Y (vs +17% Y/Y in Q2 and +4% in Q1), leading net sales to €49.2m in 9M (+21% Y/Y). The company has already released very strong commercial KPIs showing an 85.1% Y/Y increase in sales volumes in 3Q (9M: +18.2% Y/Y), beating management forecasts and confirming growth in Italy (805k units sold, +31.6% Y/Y), and increased sales in foreign markets (1,917k, +123% Y/Y). The acceleration is connected to the resumption of physical detailing activities in Italy and different timing of orders from partners abroad. As for profitability, we expect Adj. EBITDA of €3.7m, with 21.9% margin (-310bps Y/Y) due to higher sales costs. Supportive news flow continues. PharmaNutra recently announced two new distribution contracts for the SiderAL and Cetilar in four new countries: Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, and Jordan. The first agreement has been signed with Thai company American Taiwan Biopharm for the distribution of Cetilar in Malaysia and Singapore in early 2022, and SiderAL Forte and Folic in Vietnam, a country where iron deficiency is widespread (53% of women are estimated to be affected). The second agreement has been signed with Argon Drug Store, which has been appointed to distribute four SiderAL products in Jordan. Furthermore, the company has been granted process patent in India for the production of Cetylated Fatty Acids (CFAs), the functional ingredient contained in the Cetilar-branded topical formulations. This patent grant in India comes a few months after the same certification was granted in China, further consolidating the international development in Asia and adding visibility to mid-term sales. Supportive outlook for 4Q21 and 2022. During our US Roadshow and Star Conference meetings, management sounded extremely confident to achieve current consensus estimates for 2021, or even exceed it on the back of the positive Q3 trends and supportive exit rate to the quarter. For 2022, we expect sales to continue growing at a double-digit rate, both in Italy and international markets, and a slight reduction in profitability due to its acceleration of marketing investments, including the participation to trade-fairs, which are typically key events to enrich the pipeline for new foreign country negotiations. Change in estimates. We raise our FY21-23 top-line and EBITDA estimates, on average, by 3%, while the increase is c.2% at adj. EPS level after factoring in the tax credit obtained on the costs incurred for the transition to the MTA (€0.5mn). BUY confirmed; price target lifted to €88 (from €80). We raise our PT to €88 (from €80) on the back of higher FY-21/23 estimates reflecting a stronger H2 outlook and higher mid-term forecast due to better long-term visibility on sales following the recent news flow. Our valuation is based on pure organic growth assumptions and excludes M&A upside from its €60-80m of firepower, assuming a ND/EBITDA ratio of between 2.0x and 3.0x at the end of FY-21.",Daniele Alibrandi,Daniele Alibrandi,88,80,Buy,,EUR,1.25,,1.44,,0.63,0.72,,,,,M,STIFEL_Healthy quarter_CoNote_Oct 27 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Healthy quarter_CoNote_Oct 27 2021 01-00AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=24ea75ac-0702-4b05-a72e-81156fc6a794&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

We estimate that these delays represent around €5m of revenues that were expected in Q4-21. Second, around half of the fleet of existing ships worldwide has already been equipped with BWMS. The remaining half contains a higher share of smaller ships, needing smaller and less expensive BWMS. But the sky is not so grey. First, part of the estimated €5m canceled in Q4-21 should be realized next year, making us believe that the segment could enjoy a >50% growth in FY-22. Then, the shift to smaller BWMS should improve segment profitability in FY-22. Acquisition of Corelec brings product diversification and regional focus After adding the ozone technology to its product range through the acquisition of Triogen late 2019, Bio-UV now adds the electro-chlorination technology to its portfolio with the acquisition of Corelec, 25-employee French company. Bio-UV's portfolio now consists of three technologies: UV, ozone, elechtro-chlorination. Corelec's market share of around 50% in the water treatment market based on the electro-chlorination technology should allow Bio-UV to reinforce its leading position on the private pool market. In addition, Bio-UV enters the heating pump market, a high-growth segment that already accounts for close to 20% of Corelec revenues. Corelec makes around 90% of its revenues in France, the second largest market for private pools worldwide after the US. Given the very positive momentum observed in France since the pandemic, we think the acquisition of Corelec could offer Bio-UV an attractive higher exposure to the French market. Towards an EBITDA margin of 20% by 2025 ? Given the strongly margin-accretive acquisition of Corelec, Bio-UV anticipates a pro-forma EBITDA margin of more than 15%, versus 10.3% in FY-20 and 12.6% in H1-21 for Bio-UV standalone. We anticipate a pro-forma EBITDA margin of 15.5% in FY-22. By FY-25, we think it could reach 20% for three main reasons: 1) Corelec displays a lower fixed-cost structure than Bio-UV, resulting in a sustainable EBITDA margin of around 30%, 2) an above-Group-average growth of revenues from Corelec, and 3) an improvement of margins in the Maritime segment driven by the shift to smaller but more profitable BWMS. At such profitability levels, Bio-UV would be comparable with large listed water companies like Xylem or Evoqua (both covered by our Stifel colleague Nathan Jones). New Price Target of €6.90 We use a weighted-average price target, derived from two methodologies: a DCF method (€7.30 fair value, 50% weight) and an EV/Sales 2022E method (€6.40 fair value, 50% weight). Our new price target implies the following valuation multiples on 2022 financials: EV/Sales of 1.6x, EV/EBITDA of 10.1x, P/E of 13.6x.",Martin Tessier,Martin Tessier,6.9,7.3,Buy,,EUR,0.16,,0.5,,,,,,,,M,STIFEL_Improvement in_CoNote_Nov 17 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Improvement in_CoNote_Nov 17 2021 01-00AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=e4c6ddd7-75e0-41b9-a09b-636a7449fc0c&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
SANT GY,SANT,Dec 02 2021 06:19AM,S&T AG,Technology Hardware,Initiation of coverage: Transformers — Rise of Kontron ,"We initiate coverage on S&T with a Buy rating and a SOTP/DCF-derived targetprice of €30.00, offering significant potential upside of 57%. e We believe that S&T is in a new phase of transformation, during which we expect to see the sale of the lower-margin IT Services division and the remaining business, likely to be named Kontron, to become an even more integrated Internet-of-Things (loT) pure-play over time. e Thus, for us, the investment case is a break-up story, which should hold significant value upon the envisaged selling price (€8.30-10.60 per share) realisation as we think that the remaining loT business should explain the current market capitalisation alone. ","Austrian-based loT and IT Services group with listing in Germany Linz-based S&T is part of the digitisation value chain for many industrial verticals like manufacturing, transportation and healthcare. Through its loT divisions, it sells hardware and software components as well as services to a broad range of customers for many different applications. Its c.€600m revenue IT Services focus on Integration Services, Outsourcing and Consulting in the DACH and CEE regions. Break-up story The IT Services division has been earmarked for sale (project focus), perhaps as early as 2022. Management is looking for a price range of €550-700m. We think this could push investor focus towards the loT pure-play strategy, alluding to both higher growth and margins (10-14% goal vs. 8-9% EBITDA margin for the IT Services division). Thereafter, management will use the >€900m of liquidity for complementary M&A in loT, as well as for shareholder remuneration (€200m). Mission to improve confidence In general, S&T has reacted quite rigorously to the criticism of short-sellers and has been improving confidence in the company via its Trust — Transparency — Share (TTS) programme and other measures. We also consider the IT Services sale as part of improving the margin profile and focus of the company, likely to be named Kontron if and when a sale goes ahead. We are ahead of consensus We believe that pushed-out revenue due to the chip crisis (€40-110m) in 2021 will return as revenue in 2022/early 2023. Overall, we think that the respective catch-up effect from the margin perspective should be more pronounced compared with consensus as our EBITDA'22-23E forecasts are 2%/4% ahead. Five main risk factors identified We think the most prominent risks are (1) exacerbation of the chip crisis, (2) return of the COVID-19 pandemic, (3) loss of confidence if it fails to sell the IT Services division at a reasonable price, (4) risk of overpaying in future acquisitions (5) key employee risk, particularly in light of the importance of CEO Hannes Niederhauser. ESG findings We believe that S&T still needs to implement defined company-wide goals with respect to environmental factors while it has a solid social and governance setup. With regard to the latter, we question Ennoconn's sizeable representation on the board relative to its 27% share (50% of votes on the supervisory board).

VOLCARB SS,VOLCARB,Dec 08 2021 11:38AM,Volvo Car AB,Automotive,Initiation of coverage: safe drive but not going our way yet ,"We initiate on Volvo Car AB with a Sell rating and price target of SEK61.00. Volvois a fast-growing premium brand. Lack of scale versus BMW and Mercedes is being compensated by a consequent shift to high-margin SUVs (some 75% now) and smart platform sharing between brands. However, profitability is still below that of German premium brands (the margin gap has started to widen again) and the cash-conversion rates are relatively low. We consider the volume target as too ambitious and the brand lacks the pricing power of German peers. Most importantly, the significant valuation premium seems unjustified. ","Ambitious growth plans: The top-line CAGR in 2016-19 was a very high 9.7% (in an environment of expanding markets and above-average growth for premium brands). For 2025, Volvo aims to achieve 1.2 million unit sales, implying a 2020-25 CAGR of 12.6%. We believe this is overly bullish. If the consensus follows this guidance, we think estimate cuts are likely going forward. Solid brand, but not where BMW or Mercedes are: Our analysis shows that pricing for the Volvo brand is weaker than at peers, especially in the upper segments. Social media analysis supports this: Volvo is a strong brand, but just not as strong as Mercedes or BMW. As good as it gets: Volvo has the highest share of SUVs among peers and produces almost all vehicles on just two platforms. Both support profitability. However, incremental cost savings or mix improvements seem unlikely. Lower margin, lower cash conversion: The gap in profitability to German OEMs declined in 2016-19. However, it widened again in 2020 and in H1 2021 to 4.7pp (adjusted for one-offs). Volvo has a significantly higher R&D capitalisation rate than peers. This is also visible in lower cash-conversion rates. This implies a weaker earnings quality, in our view, suggesting also a lower valuation multiple. Valuation premium: Based on our estimates, Volvo trades at a 2022 PE ratio of 14.5x and an EV/EBIT multiple of 8.2x. These compare with a median PE ratio of 6.2x anda median EV/EBIT of 3.7x. We would need to assume much higher values for Polestar, beyond US$30bn, to bring the valuation of the Volvo core business excluding Polestar in line with that of Daimler or BMW. Why invest in Volvo? The attractiveness of Volvo is the mixture of a 'pure-play' premium brand (only BMW offers that so far) and the 49% stake in the 'pure-play' EV start-up Polestar. However, from Q4 2021, Mercedes is set to become a ‘pure-play’ premium OEM (after the Truck spin-off) and from H1 2022 Polestar is planning to become a listed company, too.",Daniel Schwarz,Daniel Schwarz;Pierre-Yves Quémener,61,,Sell,,SEK,4.43,,4.89,,,,,,,,M,STIFEL_Initiation of_CoNote_Dec 08 2021 11-38AM.pdf,STIFEL_Initiation of_CoNote_Dec 08 2021 11-38AM,INITIATION OF COVERAGE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=f403ec2d-9a44-4662-944b-4120c34a2871&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
BRE IM,BRE,Dec 13 2021 11:39AM,Brembo,Automotive Supplier,"Initiation of coverage: A Perfect Brake Bias, Ready To Go At Full Speed ","We initiate coverage of Brembo with a Buy rating and €14.50 price target, providing19% upside potential. e Brembo is the global leader in brake disc technology for the automotive vehicle industry, operating in 15 countries across three continents, with FY20 revenues of €2.2bn and c.11k employees. e@ While short-term visibility remains rather low, we expect investor focus to gradually shift to the projected strongly improving operating performance from 2H22 onwards, boosted by a volume rebound once the chip shortage issue is finally resolved (as end-demand across the group’s key clients and markets remains healthy). e@ On the back of Brembo's strong financial position (we expect it to reach a net debt/EBITDA ratio of below 0.6x in FY22), we believe there could be ample room for M&A (we estimate a total potential firepower of around €1.5bn), likely aimed at strengthening its expertise in software development, data science and artificial intelligence. e Our ESG analysis reveals a good score, with further progress towards achieving its environmental goals. ","Favourable mid-term perspectives ahead on a robust end-deman4d, still low short-term visibility should be priced-in While short-term visibility, in our view, remains rather low, this should already be fully priced-in (especially after management's cautious statements of late and guidance revision), while investor focus should gradually shift to the expected improving operating performance from 2H22. This recovery is mainly based on: (1) a strong volume rebound once the chip shortage issue is finally resolved, as end-demand across the group’s key clients and markets remains healthy, (2) favourable price/mix impact, as we expect Brembo to fully recover the higher cost of raw materials during the next quarters (there is typically some time lag until prices are increased to factor in the higher input costs), (3) improving operating efficiencies and (4) a positive reversal in working capital trends should boost next year’s cash generation (FY22 FCF yield of >6%, still somewhat conservative in our view). Looking for a transformational deal? Following the recent acquisitions in the motorbikes segment (J.Juan and SBS Friction), meant to complete the company's product range, Brembo may now look at acquisitions of companies focused on software and data analysis (in line with its new business model as a solution provider, with an increasing focus on digital technology and artificial intelligence): this should be potentially highly value-creative (we estimate up to 15%, if assuming a total cash-out of c.€1.5bn), allowing the group to further improve its price positioning and benefit from higher ""tech-related"" margins. We note that Brembo’s management has pointed out on several occasions that the group could even consider a large transformational deal, with its core shareholder agreeing to dilute his stake below 50% (without losing control of the company, also thanks to the loyalty share voting mechanism). A merger with Pirelli (PIRC IM, Hold, €5.97, covered by Pierre-Yves Quéméner) could be amongst the potential options (with the key hurdle being some pushback from Pirelli's shareholders): in this case, we estimate a potential value creation of up to €1.20 per share (or c.10% upside, see detailed analysis inside). Initiating coverage with a Buy rating and price target of €14.50 We value Brembo using a DCF analysis (WACC 7.4%, terminal growth rate of 1.5%). At our target, the stock would be trading at FY22 adj. EV/EBITDA and EV/EBIT multiples of 8.5x and 13.6x respectively, with a FCF yield of 5.3%. The main downside risks are related to further shortages of raw materials and components, negatively impacting production at the customer level, and increasing energy and logistics costs. The biggest upside optionality, in our view, relates to a stronger than expected rebound in volumes once the chip shortage issue is solved, faster recovery in profitability (driven by higher volumes, operating efficiencies and a better price/mix), and potential value-creating M&A deals.",Renato Gargiulo,Renato Gargiulo,14.5,,Buy,,EUR,0.64,,0.78,,0.23,0.24,,,,,M,STIFEL_Initiation of_CoNote_Dec 13 2021 11-39AM.pdf,STIFEL_Initiation of_CoNote_Dec 13 2021 11-39AM, INITIATION OF COVERAGE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=12b2fab5-907b-4325-97fd-f17daacf2770&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
PFV GY,PFV,Dec 15 2021 12:07PM,Pfeiffer Vacuum Technology AG,Industrials,Initiation of coverage:  ‘Empty rooms™ must be PFV’s favourite song ,"A vacuum could be an empty room. However, a vacuum requires a lot togenerate and not without reason; Asslar-based Pfeiffer Vacuum (PFV) can look over 130 years of manufacturing pumps. Today, it belongs to the leading companies for vacuum pumps in Europe, components, chambers and systems. e@ We initiate with a Hold rating and price target of €207.00, reflecting a rich EV/ EBIT'22E of ~20x vs. 5Y historical median of ~15x. Investors appear to be pricing in a semi hyper-cycle from which PFV should also benefit. But unprecedented growth of 23% this year does not appear to come with strong operating leverage (10Y EBIT margin average of 13.6% vs. 2021 guidance of 12-13%). e Furthermore, we await the forthcoming update on PFV's strategy — likely to be released early 2022 — to re-assess potential developments. ","Vacuum still a very attractive field Asslar-based (close to Frankfurt) PFV is benefiting from many vacuum applications for high-quality and energy-efficient production of semiconductors, flat panels and OLED chips, as well as for surface coating, research labs and analytics. We believe that vacuum can still bank on a growing number of opportunities. A wildcard could be hydrogen leak detection and battery cell manufacturing, which also require vacuum. PFV's growth vs. market — speed should be maintained The vacuum pump market is projected to increase from €3.7bn (2018) by a CAGR of 6% to €6.0bn in 2026 by GMI. Thanks to the strong semi-led increase in 2020, PFV's 2017-21E CAGR has improved to 6.6%, but was relatively slow in 2011-21E (we calculate just c.3% organic growth). Main shareholder Busch — will it increase its grip on the company? We do not expect 63% shareholder Busch SE to affect the status quo any time soon. The anti-trust approved collaboration scheme already safeguards a good degree of potential synergies (e.g., purchasing, cross-selling, IT). Buying the remaining stake in PFV required ~€800m in liquidity. Our ahead-of-consensus estimates justify a high target price, but no upside Our EBIT estimates are 6.0%/4.2%/2.2% above consensus for FY 21-23E. The consensus price target currently stands at €190.00. Our valuation via DCF (cross- checked against multiple/peer group) yields a higher price target of €207.00, but hardly any upside potential. Five main risk factors identified For us, the most prominent risk factors are (1) supply-chain constraints, (2) return of COVID-19, (3) cyclical swings, exacerbated by semi double-ordering, (4) competitive risks largely exerted by vacuum bellwether Atlas Copco (Not Covered) and (5) headwinds in the event of a weak US$ (tailwinds if the US$ is strong).

NDX1 GY,NDX1,Dec 21 2021 01:11AM,Nordex SE,Industrials,Initiation of coverage: Winds of change,"We initiate coverage of Nordex with a Buy rating and price target of €20.00.e@ Nordex offers a combination of margin expansion potential, structural growth driven by a solid onshore pipeline, and an attractive valuation which we see as offering an entry point at overly discounted multiples. e@ We estimate a sales CAGR of 4.6% from 2020 to 2023, with a significant EBITDA margin expansion, reaching its target of 8% in 2024. e Our price target of €20.00 is derived from a granular DCF analysis, which points to an implied EV/EBITDA 2023E multiple of 8.3x. ","Three main drivers behind our positive investment stance Our Buy rating is based on the following three pillars: (1) As a well-established onshore “pure play”, Nordex stands to gain from the long-term pipeline growth in onshore wind energy, (2) we see margin expansion driven by improved product mix, with a higher share of its Delta4000 turbines and a rising share of service revenues. This is complemented by incremental operational gains once the Indian operations ramp up, (3) perhaps the market is overlooking these longer-term opportunities, and is taking an overly sceptical view of the margin story, which leaves Nordex as an attractively valued stock. Onshore overlooked The increased focus on climate targets increases the visibility of future global energy mix. This ultimately results in an attractive installations pipeline for onshore wind, with an accumulated CAGR of ~8% for 2020-30E. We believe the market is underestimating the opportunities in onshore wind, as attention is drawn to offshore and other emerging technologies, such as hydrogen. This is reflected in valuations across the sector, creating what we see as an attractive investment opportunity. For Nordex, we model moderate market share gains, which translate into an accumulated CAGR of ~12% for installations over the same period of time. Margin expansion story driven by Delta4000 and Indian factory ramp up We model a significant EBITDA margin expansion of ~570bps from 2021 to 2023. Due to temporary headwinds, we conservatively estimate that Nordex will miss its 8% target in 2023, which we model to be reached in 2024. However, we see a miss to its targets as they are already discounted at current share price levels. Key tailwinds include: (1) the expansion into India as a manufacturing hub to serve non-European markets as an incremental margin driver, as compared to its current Europe-centric supply chain (~83% own-production and ~50% supplier base); (2) further margin accretion driven by a rising share of Nordex’s more profitable (~3-5% higher) Delta4000 platform; (3) upside potential to our base case should the PTC subsidy extension be approved by the US Senate. DCF-based price target of €20.00 We believe the high visibility of the underlying onshore wind market, afforded by the announced energy-transition targets, is best appreciated via a granular DCF analysis. A DCF-based valuation points to a price target of €20.00, indicating an implied EV/EBITDA 2023 multiple of 8.3x. Risks We identify three main risks to our investment case: (1) underwhelming profitability, missing the 8% EBITDA target more significantly than expected, (2) impact from inflationary pressures on raw materials and logistics coming in higher than expected, (3) prolonged operational and financial impacts from shipping delays, shortage of components and/or re-emergence of COVID-19. ESG findings Our detailed standard Stifel ESG analysis shows that Nordex is an enabler of a more sustainable future, well led by an experienced management team, but with a relatively low ratio of female employees, which the company is trying to improve.",Clarice Monarcha,Clarice Monarcha,20,,Buy,,EUR,-1.05,,-0.3,,0,0,,,,,M,STIFEL_Initiation of_CoNote_Dec 21 2021 01-11AM.pdf,STIFEL_Initiation of_CoNote_Dec 21 2021 01-11AM, INITIATION OF COVERAGE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=40b11002-9295-4b94-abf1-a32d7039b20d&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

Schweiter's defensive properties (e.g. strong FCF Yield FY-21 >5%, dividend yield roughly 3%) make an ideal hedge for stormier times, its products are sustainable (lightweight) and the valuation looks decent. e We forecast a revenue CAGR of 5% for the next three years with a stable EBITDA margin of >13.5% (FY-20 15.1%; 5-year average FY-16-20 12.1%). ","Three main drivers behind our positive investment case: (1) Schweiter's defensive business model proved highly robust during the pandemic (FY-20 sales -2%, EBITDA +43%, margin 15.1%). (2) Its products contribute significantly to the reduction of natural resource consumption (renewable materials like balsa wood) and (3) Compared with other Swiss Industry stocks with a comparable profile and similar end markets, Schweiter trades at a discount. M&A transactions open up additional potential. Diversified end-markets: Apart from the wind sector (c.15% of total sales), Schweiter's broadly heterogeneous end markets benefit from the economic upturn (SFe FY-21 sales CHF 1.25bn (y/y +8%). Thanks to the strong positioning of the Schweiter brands, the significant increases in raw material prices can be passed on to customers (with a certain delay). Its profitability margins are already significantly higher than the pre-Covid-19 era (FY-19 EBITDA margin 10.4%; SFe 2021 13.2%). Its exposure to the wind business opens further long-term potential (key word climate strategy 2050). ESG at a chance: Schweiter boasts strength in terms of environmental compliance. Its products (e.g. balsa) and solutions are predestined for reuse and the reduction of resources (light-weight products). In terms of its commitment to ESG frameworks and financial transparency, we believe there is some room for improvement. Attractive valuation: Our price target of CHF 1,660.00 is the average of a peer group valuation multiple (50%) and a DCF model (50%). The applied EV/EBIT 2022E target multiple of 16.2x implies a discount for Schweiter (13.7x) compared with other Swiss Industry stocks (EV/EBIT 22E 14.8x) with a comparable profile and similar end markets. We expect Schweiter will close the valuation gap to its peers (re-rating less pronounced so far).

A better pricing environment, operational leverage and shift in product mix should lift margins structurally. e There is substantial upside potential in Li-batteries for graphite anode material (GAM) for the upcoming European battery value chain, which could become a material growth driver. ","SGL became a restructuring case due to its disappointing operating trends, negative FCF and stretched balance sheet. The new CEO, Thorsten Derr and CFO, Thomas Dippold, starting in 2020, were able to turn the situation around in a short period of time. Earnings should reach new highs in 2021. After six years with negative FCF, cash management lifted FCF into positive territory as of 2020 and balance sheet ratios improved. Restructuring the balance sheet and ESG progress are still to come. In the next chapter of the company's story there will be a focus on growth. In recent years, SGL has gained traction in growth markets like automotive, semi-conductors and LED at Graphite Solutions. Composite Solutions managed the turnaround in 2021. Gaining traction with the automotive industry should result in double-digit growth rates in the coming years. Operating leverage and improving product mix shift should support a positive margin development. The demand for GAM is expected to grow 4x to 7x by 2030. A large contract of one of the upcoming European battery producers would trigger a big greenfield investment, which seems to be a promising opportunity. SGL is developing new GAM grades and received €42.9m of grants from IPCEI (Important Projects of Common European Interest) for these research efforts. However, it is still too early to bake it into our investment case, but nevertheless we see upside risk to our estimates. Our 2022E EV/EBITDA (5y average) delivers a value of €9.20 per share. However, taking the progress in end-market split into account and valuing SGL by business line delivers a SOTP value of €10.50.

This will allow MagForce USA to bill for the entire procedure (including the instillation of the NanoTherm particles) generating up to threefold revenues compared to just selling NanoTherm particles. Up to 100 patients are planned to be treated in this stage 2b phase and then return to active surveillance without definitive treatment, such as external beam radiation or prostatectomy. Following the final protocol, MagForce will submit interim data packages at 15 and 30 patients treated for FDA review, whilst treatments continue. MagForce currently does not expect major delays in completing the study, which is expected for summer 2022, and then plans to submit updated data to the FDA for potential marketing approval. Globally, there are over 500,000 prostate cancer patients annually who could benefit from an effective focal treatment with minimal side effects like MagForce’s NanoTherm therapy. The addressable market in the USA alone is worth $4.1bn per year when considering revenue from the entire procedure. Operating proprietary focal cancer treatment centres enables MagForce to make more efficient use of its devices and increase revenue per patient significantly. Additionally, MagForce is making good progress with the rollout of its NanoTherm brain cancer therapy in Europe, €50m peak sales opportunity: On 30 September 2021, MagForce announced its first collaboration agreement with a hospital in Malaga, Spain, for the commercial treatment of brain cancer patients using its NanoTherm therapy system. The hospital will be equipped with MagForce “s ""plug-and treat"" solution — a mobile container fully operational with a pre-installed NanoActivator device. Subject to inspections and permissions by local authorities, commercial treatments are expected to commence in Q1 2022E. In addition to the collaboration for commercial treatments, an investigator-initiated trial is planned with the NanoTherm therapy system. The outcome of the trial will be used to apply for general reimbursement. One of the doctors conducting this trial is also the president of the Spanish Radiation Oncology Society and thus a strong advocate for the implementation of hyperthermia in cancer treatment in Spain, which we interpret as positive external validation and support of MagForce’s NanoTherm technology. We estimate a total number of 35-50 NanoTherm brain cancer therapies to be performed in Europe in 2021E followed by >100 therapies in 2022E. Various liquidity options in place: MagForce can utilise various financial instruments, which should be sufficient in our view to reach cash breakeven by end-2022E. We estimate the total current available liquidity for MagForce to be >€30m (c.€22m undrawn EIB loan, c.€11m convertible bond to Yorkville Advisors Global LP and €2.5m recently issued convertible bond to Apeiron Investment Group Ltd._).",Marcus Wieprecht,Marcus Wieprecht,13,,Buy,,EUR,-0.19,,-0.16,,0,0,,,,,M,STIFEL_Major milestone_FlashCoNote_Nov 09 2021 10-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Major milestone_FlashCoNote_Nov 09 2021 10-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=9825d95d-ad6d-4ffc-91f6-0d146dbfef4c&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
MIKN SW,MIKN,Dec 13 2021 06:00AM,Mikron Holding AG,Industrials, Medium-targets in reach for the first time in many years ,"With this report, we transfer primary coverage of Mikron Holding to Christian Arnold.e After strong H1-21 results and a positive outlook for H2-21, also supported by improving end-market trends and concluded restructuring, we think Mikron is in a position to reach its medium-term EBIT margin target of 5% to 7% in FY-21E. e We adjusted our FY-21/22 estimates by 3%/1% on sales and 153%/31% on EBIT level, implying an operating margin of 6.3% / 6.1%. The ROCE (NOPAT) could come close to Mikron's WACC for the first time in many years. We expect ROCE (NOPAT) to be at 8.1% in FY-21E, and to move up further to 8.6% in FY-23E. e We left our valuation approach unchanged (DCF model, historical EV/EBIT multiple, soft factor discount for limited liquidity). Based on our reviewed estimates, we increase our price target from CHF 6.5 to CHF 8.8. Despite the significant implied upside potential, we reiterate our Hold rating. Given the very high volatility in Mikron's operating performance in the past, we first look for confirmation of the positive trends observed in H1-21. ","Three quarters of Mikron's business are doing well Mikron published very solid H1-21 results last summer. However, despite the reduction of its machinery business, which resulted in a termination of its machining centres business in 2019/2020, the Machining division remains Mikron’s problem child for the foreseeable future. We do not expect the machinery business to achieve a turnaround in FY-21E or FY-22E, due to weakness in the automotive end markets. In contrast, the Tool division (smaller part of the Machining Solutions segment) and the Automation segment achieved strong growth in H1-21. This positive momentum and satisfying profitability is expected to continue in H2-21E and FY-22E. The Automation segment benefits from the high order backlog and the continuing demand from the pharmaceutical and medtech industries. Medium-term EBIT margin target of 5% to 7% to be reached in FY-21E Based on the 33% higher order intake in H1-21 and the significant increased operating profitability (EBIT margin of 5.9%) as well as a positive tax impact of CHF 5.0m, we significantly increased our FY-21 bottom-line assumption (+331%). We expect the Automation segment to maintain an EBIT margin level of around 9% in FY-21-23E (H1-21: 9.4%). For the Machining Solution segment, we forecast a positive EBIT margin of between 1.5% (FY-21E) and 2.5% (FY-23E), with significant positive contribution from the Tool division, but a still negative contribution from Machining division. This results in group EBIT margin of 6.3%, 6.1% and 6.4% in FY-21E/22E/23E. New leadership team could shift focus We liked the appointment of Paul Zumbuhl as the new chairman and of Marc Desrayaud as of the new CEO in FY-21, hoping for new strategic impulses. After the departure of longstanding CEO Bruno Cathomen in FY-21, replaced by experienced new CEO Marc Desrayaud (management positions at ABB, Rieter, Autoneum, Oerlikon Balzers), the focus could change from the Machining Solutions division to the more profitable Automation Solutions division. Update of our ESG assessment - still room for improvement Whereas our previous assessment was based on the sustainability report of the year 2017 (10 pages), our current analysis has a broader and updated database with the sustainability report 2020 (23 pages). We welcome the more detailed information, but still believe there is room for further improvement (clear goals and/or timelines).",Christian Arnold,Christian Arnold;Pascal Boll,8.8,6.5,Hold,,CHF,1.09,,0.81,,0.2,0.25,,,,,M,STIFEL_Medium-targets in_CoNote_Dec 13 2021 06-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_Medium-targets in_CoNote_Dec 13 2021 06-00AM,COMPANY UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=4264c83f-2b8b-4246-9a8d-56592fda4736&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
HO FP,HO,Oct 28 2021 01:23AM,Thales,Aerospace & Defence,Model Update Post Q3-21 Revenues ,"We update our financial model for Thales (rated Hold) following overall fine Q3-21Order Intake & Sales on Tuesday, 26 October. We nudge up our FY-21 and FY-22 EPS estimates, but leave our PT unchanged at €85.00 (implying an +8% TSR). We also include an ESG Assessment in this note. e Thales posted a 1% sales miss vs company-compiled consensus, driven mainly by its key Defence & Security segment, a 5% orders beat, left FY-21 guidance unchanged, and indicated ~€150m Free Cashflow upside from an advance on a large export contract. e@ We see it overall as a small positive for our view that Thales is a potential revenue, margins and re-rating story, as its book-to-bill recovers from slightly sluggish levels pre-2020 and Aerospace margins recover. However, given the little upside that we see for consensus estimates, Thales’ trading multiples being around the most expensive European defence prime, and our belief that multiple expansion may be limited by both concerns as to post-COVID profile of French and European defence spending and by a long-term secular shift to ESG investing, our rating remains a Hold. e We continue to believe that more Aerospace-biased names may perform better as coronavirus is perceived to recede, and over the medium-term, reversal of fiscal expansion may pressure defence spending, so we maintain our Hold rating. Amongst defence-oriented stocks, we would prefer Buy-rated Dassault Aviation (AM.FP, €90.00) or Leonardo (LDO.IM, €6.50). e In 2021 YTD, Thales shares are up 9%, vs +22% for the CAC 40 index, and +12% for the Stoxx A&D index. Thales trades at the top or in the top 3 of European Defence Primes on any multiple, although slightly low vs its history. We view the peer-premium as largely justified by a strong projected EPS recovery CAGR of 20% (FY-20 to FY-23), benefiting from a depressed FY-20 base for its Aerospace segment. ","EPS Estimates Nudged Up for FY-21 & for FY-22 Our ""Adjusted EPS"" estimates are €5.95 (FY-21, up +3% vs €5.80 previously) and €7.00 for FY-22 (up +1% vs €6.90 previously). The changes are mainly due to higher revenue assumptions for Defence & Security. They are -1% below and +2% above the current I/B/E/ median consensus of €5.99 and €6.84, respectively. Valuation & Next Event Thales shares currently trade at 12x 2022E EPS, falling to 11x 2023E EPS (vs. the European Defence Primes' mean of 9x / 9x). Their 2022 P/E represents 80% relative to the CAC 40 index, which is 1.2 standard deviations below their ten-year mean of 105%. On EV multiples, the shares are broadly similarly slightly expensive relative to peers: on EV/FCF, they trade at 16x 2022E FCF, falling to 15x 2023E FCF (vs. peers on 15x / 13x). The next event is FY-21 results on Thursday, 3 March 2022. Price Target Unchanged Our PT is €85 (unchanged vs. €85 previously). It is derived from our FY-23 EPS estimate of €7.55 (down 6% vs €8.00 previously), plus a CAC 40 market multiple of 15x (down vs 16x previously), plus a target P/E Relative of 76% (up vs 69% previously), which is 1.4 standard deviations below its 10-year mean. This produces a price target of €85, which implies that in one year's time, Thales shares will trade at 11x FY-23 EPS, which implies slight multiple compression vs their current multiple of 12x FY-22 EPS, and which is slightly below their 10-year mean of 13x. €85.00 implies a Total Shareholder Return of +8% from current levels (including an estimated FY-21 dividend of €2.35).",Harry Breach,Harry Breach,85,,Hold,,EUR,5.95,,7,,2.35,2.8,,,,,M,STIFEL_Model Update_CoNote_Oct 28 2021 01-23AM.pdf,STIFEL_Model Update_CoNote_Oct 28 2021 01-23AM,EARNINGS UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=253a4313-a839-4f01-b0ff-0a18e9d19b7c&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
IRE IM,IRE,Oct 21 2021 12:01PM,Iren,Utilities,New business plan could restore confidence in Iren's low-risk value creation ,"We expect the business plan to be presented by Iren's new CEO, GianniArmani, on 11 November will restore confidence in the company's low-risk value creation story. e We forecast that the new plan will be based on an acceleration of investments in Iren's traditional businesses linked to the circular economy. On top of this, the company's cashflow generation would provide the opportunity to build cautiously a significant position in renewable power generation. e The current share price underestimates Iren's positive exposure to rising Italian power prices, in our view. e We upgrade our rating on the stock to Buy from Hold. We raise our price target to €3.20 from €2.70. ","We expect the new business plan to restore confidence in Iren's low-risk value creation story lren's share price has been flattish over the past few months, after its controlling shareholders decided to change the company's CEO, reducing visibility on its strategic development. We expect that such uncertainty will disappear with the presentation of the new business plan, planned by the new CEO, Gianni Armani, on 11 November. We expect the new plan to confirm Iren's traditional low-risk growth potential driven by businesses linked to the circular economy. On top of this, we expect Mr Armani to use Iren's strong cashflow generation to build cautiously a position in renewable power generation, which would provide further growth potential. We expect acceleration in capex linked to circular economy and further potential for investments in renewables We expect Iren to increase the six-year capex plan in its traditional businesses to €4.0bn from the current €3.7bn. We think that the company will accelerate investments in the water cycle, the waste business and district heating. On top of this, strong cashflow generation would allow it to build a position in renewable power generation, while maintaining its current credit rating and dividend policy. We calculate that Iren would have €0.6bn of financial firepower for investments in energy transition by 2026E. Iren's positive exposure to rising power prices is underestimated In our opinion, Iren's share price has not fully reflected the positive exposure of the company to the new scenario for Italian power prices through electricity production from hydro plants and waste-to-energy assets. We understand that Iren's hydro production is almost fully hedged for 2021, but only c.30% of 2022 hydro volumes have been sold forward. We raise our estimates after taking into account the new energy scenario and the contribution from new investments. We upgrade our rating to Buy from Hold. New price target €3.20 We update our valuation and estimates after removing the visibility discount we applied after the change in management in May 2021. We raise our price target to €3.20 from €2.70. We upgrade our rating on the stock to Buy from Hold. We expect the new business plan to restore investor confidence in Iren's low-risk value creation story while providing visibility on the additional value-creation potential offered by the company in its businesses linked to the circular economy.

AEIN GY,AEIN,Nov 22 2021 01:00AM,Allgeier SE,IT Services, New structure is bearing fruit ,"Allgeier reported strong 3Q21 results, with sales increasing by 17% y/y to €99mand adj. EBITDA up 6% y/y, to €10.7m, for a margin of 10.8%. e The restructuring efforts continue to pay off: A more focused positioning has resulted in more robust growth and improved earnings: We increase our sales and adj. EBITDA estimates by 6% / 10% and 22% / 43% for 2021 / 2022. e Buy & build strategy continues: Recent acquisitions have added important capabilities in attractive end markets and should be margin-accretive in the future. e Our ESG analysis yields solid results given the size of the company, with some room for improvement on even clearer communication of targets. e We confirm our Buy rating with a new price target of €40 (from €30) on the back of higher estimates after strong execution year-to-date and lowered discount rate. Adj. EPS increase due to adjustments from the measurement of stock options. ","Strong growth driven by robust digitalisation demand Allgeier has increased sales by 11% y/y after the first nine months of the year. Looking at Q3, growth has been even higher at 17% y/y. Adj. EBITDA margins have improved from quarter to quarter with 8.1% / 10.5% / 10.8% in the first three quarters. The restructuring of the Experts business has paid off. Less generic staffing business, more focus on major tenders and pitches within the IT services space and good performance of the mgm technology segment (EBIT margins of 17%+) have resulted in improved profitability of the group. The company confirmed its guidance for the full year: Sales are expected at €380-420m (+14% y/y at midpoint) and adj. EBITDA of €39-43m with an expected margin of 10%. This implies >20% growth in Q4 at the mid-point, which should be doable, in our view, as current demand trends and M&A support growth. Buy & build strategy continues Allgeier has long-standing experience in complementing organic growth with targeted acquisitions (80+ acquisitions, 10 divestments since 2005). After the spin-off of Nagarro, the company has continued with its buy & build strategy this year, making five notable acquisitions, of which especially the last one should drive earnings in the future. Allgeier has significantly expanded its capabilities in the SAP consulting/development area, and at the same time gained access to a global organisation with its own engineering and service center in India via the acquisition of Evora. We believe the company is poised for robust growth for years to come due to continued high demand for digitalisation / software development services both in the public sector and for industry clients. We expect Allgeier to guide for double-digit growth in 2022, partly driven by this year's acquisitions. Valuation and catalysts We value Allgeier using a blend of DCF and peer group valuation methods. Our DCF analysis (50% weight) yields a value of €41 per share, while the multiple-based analysis implies a value of €39 per share. The market will look for solid execution of the new growth strategy, in our view, now that the major restructuring measures of the past 2-3 years are behind us. Main risks are M&A-related, on the one hand finding attractive targets at reasonable valuations, and on the other hand integrating new businesses to achieve synergy benefits. Next catalyst could be the publication of a 2022 guidance (last year, the guidance was published on Dec 16), which might be above market expectations due to strong organic growth and sales contributions from this year's acquisitions.",Yannik Siering,Yannik Siering,40,30,Buy,,EUR,1.2,,0.96,,0.5,0.5,,,,,M,STIFEL_New structure_CoNote_Nov 22 2021 01-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_New structure_CoNote_Nov 22 2021 01-00AM,EARNINGS UPDATE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=583f2f0e-1fff-4fc9-a78d-24ab566ed117&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

","Q3 results no surprise after warning; however, order intake is strong LPKF reported Q3 results that were no surprise after the profit warning the company issued at the end of September due to delays in deliveries and shipments. Revenue came in at €24m with €0.7m of EBIT, which is both a quarter-over-quarter improvement and generally in line with the company's Q2 communication. Due to the ongoing headwinds in global supply chains, the management team became slightly more negative on the remainder of the year and specified its guidance towards the lower end of €110m to €120m revenues and 10% to 13% EBIT guidance. Without any material incremental information on LIDE, we keep our 2022E estimates mostly unchanged. For 2021E, we cut our estimates slightly and also don't expect massive movement in consensus, which was already geared towards the lower end of the guidance. We cut our revenue estimate by 3.3% and our margin estimate by 1.3pp to €110m and 10%, respectively. The main reason for our estimate cuts are the Electronics and Development segments. On the positive side, order intake showed a strong performance with a 48% YoY increase, which underpins our longer-term positive view on the name. Furthermore, Welding, sort of a problem child in the past, shows significant improvements, which bodes well for a prolonged recovery in that segment. Slightly positive conference call, with incremental news on LIDE The conference call was quite positive on the remainder of the year and provided some constructive qualitative feedback on the current LIDE situation. Our key takes: The LIDE projects with the significant display manufacturer are further advancing and management has more visibility than three months ago. LPKF is in further negotiations with additional potential customers in the semiconductor industry to negotiate new projects. Furthermore, the company could open up another use case that could lead to large volumes going forward and intends to disclose more details at a trade fair in a few weeks. A strong Q4 is underpinned by good developments in Solar and Welding, but also a strong recovery in Development. We reiterate our Buy rating and €42 price target Especially backed by the LIDE order from a semiconductor customer, we believe the investment case is intact. We value the company on a 50:50 mix of DCF and peer group- derived target multiple analysis. Our DCF model with a beta of 1.4, 2% terminal growth rate and a 9% WACC results in €46.00 implied equity value. Our peer group-derived 2022E EV/EBIT target multiple of 21.0x results in €36 implied equity value. We reiterate our Buy rating and price target of €42.

HP3A GY,HP3A,Nov 03 2021 02:00AM,Ringmetall SE,Industrials, Post Q3 Model Update: Increased profitability is sustainable ,"Strong Q3 results and increased visibility on strong earnings momentum driveour EBITDA estimates by 32%, 36% and 28% respectively. e Conference call shed light on the sustainability of higher margins and provided more confidence on further M&A deals e On the strong results and outlook's back, we increase our price target to €6.90 ","Another record Q3 after guidance raise underpins strong momentum Q3 results are a logical addition to the strong 2021 Ringmetall has seen so far. The positive top-line effects, besides steel price impacts, are coming from M&A, economic recovery as well as superior organic development. This triggered €48m in revenues, which is a 21% beat on our estimate. Respectively, on the back of realized efficiency and automation gains, EBITDA margin was a 6.8pp beat with 16.8% on a group level and even 21.2% in Industrial Packaging. Backed by the raised guidance (Revenue: €163m to €173m, EBITDA: €24m to €26m), we increase our EBITDA estimates for 2021E by 32% to the upper end of the guidance. As we believe the improved profitability is to some degree sustainable, we increase our 2022E and 2023E EBITDA estimates by 36% and 28% respectively, with further headroom, in our view. Hence, we still think that the current guidance is rather conservative for the mid-point, and based on Q2 and Q3 results, positive surprise potential is still given. Additionally, as the inliner business is still not fully recovered yet, a potential comeback of that business would be another push to revenue and EBITDA development. Conference call more positive than three months ago The management provided a crisp update on Ringmetall's current affairs and underlines the financial momentum with an upbeat and positive tone. Our key takes are: Due to the better procurement strategy and overall efficiency gains, Ringmetall is confident to keep EBITDA margins stable in the area of 15% to 18%. We are currently at the lower end of that range, hence further positive surprise potential. The inliner business only partly recovered and is still down around 30%, which should ease over the next months. More so, with automation within the inliner business, Ringmetall is confident to further accelerate growth in that division. M&A is getting more interesting again and management is confident to announce a deal in the €5m to €15m revenue range within the next six months. Industrial Handling is developing well and continue to do so over the next year, hence, the company is getting more active on the selling process again We reiterate our Buy rating and increase our price target to €6.90 We continue to like the company's product portfolio expansion and consolidation strategy. Ringmetall has built a track record of successful integration that is now paying off in today's cyclical times. We use a 50:50 weighting of DCF analysis and EV/EBIT target multiples for 2022E. Our DCF analysis yields €7.30 implied equity value and the peer group analysis €6.50. Combined, the two approaches result in our €6.90 price target (€4.90 previously).

LPK GY,LPK,Dec 23 2021 10:33AM,LPKF,Industrials, Profit warning vs JDA: Mixed news for short-term head- and long-term tailwinds ,"Profit warning based on logistics and project delays around year-end cut-offdates has binary impact on full-year result, in our view. e We take a conservative approach for 2021E and keep all other estimate years untouched, especially as 2022E already contains material LIDE orders. e Joint Development Agreement announced on 23rd December is definitely good news; however, we believe only tangible and qualitative news will trigger a major move. e We remain constructive on LPKF's future potential around LIDE and believe 2022E is a tipping point. ","Logistics remains an issue especially around reporting cut-off dates Similar to the Q3 profit warning, the 2021E full year profit warning issued on 17 December is based on delays for delivery dates around the cut-off date of 31 December. We understand the negative sentiment this causes, especially as it has now occurred multiple times; however, we also believe the company and management have a limited impact on such an outcome. This is underlined by longer-term logistics planning by the company, which is undermined by short-term changes from the freight forwarders. We cut our estimates towards the lower end of the guidance (€92m to €102m revenues, - €2m to €6m EBIT) at €95m revenues and EBIT breakeven. Due to the still uncertain impact from LIDE on 2022E, we don't adjust our estimates for 2022E and beyond. Joint Development Agreement with display player positive LIDE catalyst On a more positive note, the joint development agreement (JDA) with a global display enterprise (most likely Samsung, SFe) is a positive catalyst for LPKF, in our view, and underpins the general positive view we still have on the case. In particular, the advanced nature of the technology development should provide further confidence in management's statements about the future of LIDE and its disruptive nature going forward. We learned over the past two years that timing is very difficult on this topic, but we argue the news should definitely underline that progress is made and global display players are taking it seriously. Still, we believe the stock will continue in a more lacklustre development until we see a more tangible and quantitative statement and actual order intakes from the display industry follow. The conversations we had with the management team, the JDA, and the hiring of the new CEO make us believe that interest in, and likelihood of, a successful implementation are continuously increasing. The overall story of LPKF is still intact, in our view, and actually is supported by the recently signed JDA. Unchanged €42 price target and Buy rating Backed by the LIDE order from a semiconductor customer and the JDA, we believe the investment case is intact.

EXAI IM,EXAI,Nov 09 2021 01:02AM,Expert.ai,Software,Setting the stage ," We take a deep-dive at the market growth opportunity for Artificial Intelligence andNatural Language Processing of data, comparing industry multiples and fundraising rounds between Europe and the US. e Against this backdrop of significant market growth, we analyse the recent and upcoming operational and commercial achievements of Expert.ai, with a particular emphasis on the US market opportunity, which we see as significant. e Under the new management team, the recently updated Path to Lead plan, combined with the move to the Italian MTA market, should contribute to improve visibility. e@ We reiterate our Buy rating and price target of €3.70/share, noting the compelling valuation discount relative to peers. We see room for a multiple expansion once revenue becomes more recurring in nature and management successfully executes on the business plan. e Finally, our analysis of transaction multiples, which could become increasingly relevant as the company consolidates its position in the US, provide significant upside potential towards fair values of c.€4.50-5.50/share. ","Setting the stage for scaling up. Since the Path to Lead business plan was announced in June 2020, the company has strengthened its organisation and promoted a more international culture, moving away from an Italian-centric to a global mindset. Management has channelled investments primarily towards R&D/engineering development in Italy, and sales & marketing in the US, adding nearly 70 resources YoY at the end of H1. As a result, Expert.ai has taken major steps forward. On the product side these include the full SaaS hybrid NL platform release in June and some international awards. Commercially, we note several important account wins in key verticals and new delivery partner additions. All eyes on all-important Q4. Expecting sales inflection in 2022. Expert.ai runs a highly seasonal business, with over 60% of sales historically recorded in H2. This is linked to the nature of its product, typically seen as an investment by clients who postpone orders until year- end. With c.€11m net sales booked in H1, our current estimate of €33.5m for FY-21 (guidance: €33-34m, should include some €1m from grants) looks feasible as it implies around two-thirds of sales in H2, in line with historical seasonality. For 2022, we expect sales to accelerate sequentially, driven by the end-to-end platform launch, acceleration in S&M investments and partnership delivery. Updating our forecasts after recent newsflow. Our updated estimates mainly reflect the adoption of IFRS standards and higher labour costs as a result of the limited availability of qualified professionals in sales and R&D. We reiterate our previous sales and EBITDA estimates for FY-24, which are slightly below company projections. Additional financial needs net of IFRS should be covered by loan refinancing, capital gains from the divestment of CY4Gate and limited cash utilisation. Valuation: it's all about execution. Expert.ai provides an attractive path for investors seeking exposure to Digital Transformation and Artificial Intelligence. Under a new management team, the company has laid the foundations for scaling up its operations, particularly in the US, while migrating towards a SaaS business model. The stock currently trades at a discount to peers on an EV/sales basis in FY21 and FY22, as the full SaaS platform has only just been launched and it's unlikely to drive material growth until next year. As soon as the overall business becomes more recurring in nature and management successfully executes the business plan, we believe there is further potential for multiple expansion from current levels. The appeal of the equity story is reinforced in our view by the M&A optionality, particularly once the company consolidates its presence in the US and its brand internationally.",Daniele Alibrandi,Daniele Alibrandi,3.7,,Buy,,EUR,-0.26,,-0.21,,0,0,,,,,M,STIFEL_Setting the_CoNote_Nov 09 2021 01-02AM.pdf,STIFEL_Setting the_CoNote_Nov 09 2021 01-02AM,COMPANY UPDATE ,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=6060c801-1581-48c2-b81b-68920a32df8c&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

CSH GY,CSH,Nov 11 2021 12:21PM,CENIT AG,IT Services,Solid Q3 heralds a dynamic Q4 ,"CENIT reported a solid set of 3Q21 results, with sales up 1% y/y and EBIT up68% y/y, mainly driven by a strong consulting & services business (+10% y/y) and ongoing cost containment measures. e Our estimates remain broadly unchanged in anticipation of a strong Q4 (~14% sales growth) that should enable the company to reach its FY21 goals. e Our ESG analysis yields solid results given the size of the company, with room for improvement on clearer communication of targets. e@ We confirm our Buy recommendation and leave the price target unchanged at €17.00. M&A could be a growth driver in the mid-term and CENIT could make use of its robust financial foundation (€15m net liquidity, 50% equity ratio) to complement organic growth. ","Recovery continues ... 2020 posed a big challenge as CENIT is heavily exposed to cyclical markets that have been hit the hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic (~70% of clients in automotive, aerospace and manufacturing). Sales in Q3 came in at €35.3m, up 1% y/y. The main driver was a strong performance of the consulting and services business that increased by 10% to €9.6m (27% of group sales). Third-party software sales declined slightly, by 2%, to €22m (62% of group sales). Personnel expenses increased slightly on improved sales volumes, while the cost of materials was down due to a different product mix. Employee headcount fell to 675 (3Q20: 711; 2Q21: 695), probably due to the short- time work schemes used by the company during the pandemic. Group EBIT saw healthy development, rising 68% y/y to €1.5m, on the back of ongoing successful cost containment measures. The 14% increase of order intake (on weak comps) points towards further operational improvement in 4Q21 and beyond. ... and should accelerate in 4Q21 The company confirmed its guidance of ~€152m sales and EBIT of ~€4.9m (3.2% margin). This implies Q4 growth of 14% to ~€43m at an EBIT margin of >6%, in line with Q4 sales figures seen pre-pandemic (4Q19: €45.6m; 4Q18: €46.7m). As the largest VAR of Daussault Systemes software globally, the optimistic tone of Dassault leaves us hopeful for an improvement towards the year-end and beyond. Dassault's FY21 licence revenue guidance was increased again, from 19-21% before to 21-22% in CC, and suggests a strong recovery on the back of easier comps, a robust pipeline and the progress made in converting deals in the pipeline, especially large ones. Valuation and catalysts We value CENIT using a blend of DCF and peer group valuation methods. Our DCF analysis (75% weight) yields a value of €18.00 per share while the multiples-based analysis implies a value of €16.00. Main risks include: (1) Sluggish demand recovery into 2022 due to adverse effects from the pandemic in end-markets; (2) M&A-related risks such as failed execution or integration issues; (3) poor execution on 2025 targets after the heavy external shock in 2020 that resulted in a revenue decline.",Yannik Siering,Yannik Siering,17,,Buy,,EUR,0.4,,0.53,,0.4,0.5,,,,,M,STIFEL_Solid Q3_CoNote_Nov 11 2021 12-21PM.pdf,STIFEL_Solid Q3_CoNote_Nov 11 2021 12-21PM,EARNINGS UPDATE ,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=f49b548d-cda5-4fd1-8910-e31e8e927732&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView

HOLN SW,HOLN,Dec 27 2021 02:00AM,Holcim Ltd,Building Materials,An Early Christmas Surprise ,"Holcim announced a larger ‘bolt-on’ transaction just before Christmas last weekacquiring Malarkey Roofing Products. We consider the transaction a marginal positive, being in line with its 2025 strategy, albeit at a full valuation. Synergies with Firestone Building Products should be high, while sustainability, renovation needs/exposure in context of a growing U.S. population are also positives. Pricing power of Malarkey also appears reasonable. We see pricing power, decarbonisation and M&A in context of continued global stimulus as key themes for 2022. This acquisition should help with the decarbonisation efforts of the Group with more acquisitions expected in 2022. One concern we have is that the Group pays dearly for this decarbonisation, while selling emerging market assets at the low point in terms of earnings. Considering buying back more shares does represent a viable alternative, in our view. The biggest driver for the stock, however, is its exposure to commodity countries and India, in our view. We expect the Sub-Continent to become a major growth theme over the next two to five years. The Group has one of the highest exposures to the Sub-Continent amongst developed market listed companies. Holcim has been added to our European & Swiss top ideas list in Oct-21 and is our highest ranked heavy-side materials stock since Dec-21. In our view, this outperformance could last for years. ","Buying Malarkey Roofing Products at US$1.35bn appears full value. Pre synergies this deal is valued at 11.3x 22E resulting in earnings enhancement of ~2% and a ROIC of ~5%. Post synergies, the valuation moves to 8.4x 22E EV/EBITDA resulting in earnings enhancement of ~3% and a ROIC of ~7% (see Figure 6). This compares to its 2025 ROIC target of 10%. This pre and post synergies valuation compares to the latest Saint Gobain (Hold, €60.7) GCP Applied Technologies’ valuation of 13.2x and 8.8x respectively. Owens Corning (not covered), one of the largest asphalt shingle suppliers in the U.S. is valued at <6x. One should also note the large jump in revenues from an estimated US$450m 21E to ~US$600m 22E, which raises questions about the base EBITDA of US$120m. Given the overlap with Firestone Building Products ('FBP', see Figure 5) the US$40m of synergies could be possible, but appear to be on the high side. We note that the Group's own shares trade <6x 22E highlighting a finely balanced trade off with higher priced acquisitions to decarbonise the business. For more information on the deal click here. Decarbonisation, sustainability and increased renovation needs/exposure appear to be the main drivers for this deal. The Group wants to have some 30% net sales coming from its Solutions & Products segment ('S&P') by 2025 to decarbonise the business. Post this transaction and FBP revenues from the S&P segment should contribute some 16% to Group net sales (from ~8% in 2020). In terms of EBITDA, the S&P segment should represent ~10% post this deal and FBP (vs ~3% in 2020). More deals are clearly envisaged on this basis and possible given the low gearing (at ~1.2x ND/EBITDA 22E, even post this latest deal). We would hence not be surprised to see more deals in 2022, especially in Europe. When looking at Malarkey Roofing in terms of products, we like the sustainability and recycling angle, while there should be further growth upside in terms of U.S. population numbers (~30m more now than in 2007) and renovation needs. The 11% CAGR in sales (from 2012 to 2022E) mentioned by the Group appears in line with the U.S. housing market and shingle prices (see Figures 2-4). Pricing power itself seems reasonable, in line with inflation since the mid-1970s (at ~3.6% p.a.). Significant value on offer, while its exposure to commodity countries and India remains underappreciated. At 5.7x 22E EV/EBITDA (pre IFRS16) the stock is now the most attractively valued in its history (see Figure 12), unless you think that the Group needs significant Green capex. Investors should note that the Group could spend as much as CHF16bn (or CHF25/share) of Green capex (without getting any returns) and still be fairly valued vs history. The investment would equate to US$253/t for its European capacities, which appears excessive. More importantly, we believe that the market still fails to see the potential demand and pricing effect coming from higher commodity prices in its emerging markets. Equally, if not more important is the Group's exposure to India, which is now where China was in 2001 (see Figures 8 & 9). Its exposure to emerging markets and the Sub- Continent amount to almost 50% and 25% respectively in terms of its cement capacities (see Figure 7).",Tobias Woerner,Tobias Woerner,65,,Buy,,CHF,4.15,,4.58,,2,2,,,,,M,STIFEL_An Early_FlashCoNote_Dec 27 2021 02-00AM.pdf,STIFEL_An Early_FlashCoNote_Dec 27 2021 02-00AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=3f142892-312f-4ac7-bed1-c64332358e97&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
MGGT LN,MGGT,Dec 24 2021 07:43AM,Meggitt,Aerospace & Defence,Model Update ,"We update our financial model for Meggitt (rated Hold). We cut FY-21 and FY-22EPS estimates, mainly due to a more sluggish margin recovery than we had previously anticipated, but we raise our PT to 800p, the level of the agreed-upon bid from Parker Hannifin (implying an 8% Total Shareholder Return). We also include an ESG Assessment with this note. e In our opinion, the bid from Parker Hannifin is highly likely to be completed. We do not anticipate that the Intervention Notice by the UK Government in October is likely to lead to any significant obstacle to the completion process, given the very low UK defence exposure of Meggitt, and its largely non-UK operations. At the time of the bid, completion was expected in Q3-22, and we have no reason to believe that there is any material issue in the applications for various approvals. e The underlying organic story continues, in our opinion, to lag aftermarket- exposed supplier peers, due to Meggitt's relatively high defence revenue exposure (46% of FY-20 group revenue), and a slowdown in defence aftermarket demand in the US, persistently peer-lagging Civil Aero. aftermarket (""AM"") growth, and a slightly greater P&L hit from supply-chain disruption than we have so far seen from peers. e Given this, we have a preference in a UK A&D context for Senior (SNR LN, 135p, Buy), and in a Eurozone context, for MTU Aero Engines (MTX GY, €181, Buy) and Safran (SAF FP, €107.04, Buy). e In 2021 year-to-date, Meggitt shares are up 58%, vs +14% for the FTSE 100, and +9% for the European A&D Sector (as measured by the Stoxx A&D index). ","EPS Estimates Cut Our ""Underlying EPS"" estimates are now 16.0p (2021E, down 20% vs. 20.0p previously) and 24p (2022E, down 10% vs 26.5p previously). The changes mainly reflect slightly lower margins in Airframe Systems, Engine Systems (FY-21 only), and Services & Support, due to a slower Civil Aero aftermarket rebound, a Defence aftermarket revenue decline, and a modest impact from supply-chain disruption. These estimates are 3% below and 2% above current I/B/E/S median consensus of 16.5p and 23.5p, respectively. Price Target Raised Our new PT is 800p (up 68% vs 475p previously). It reflects the 800p bid from Parker Hannifin, which, as we commented here, appears highly probable to be completed. An 800p PT implies a Total Shareholder Return of 8% from current levels (including FY-21E dividend of nil). Valuation & Next Event Meggitt shares currently trade at 31x 2022E EPS, falling to 25x 2023E EPS (vs. Euro. Civil Aero. mean of 26x / 18x). This compares to their 10-year mean of 14x Forecast Year EPS. On EV/FCF, they trade at 48x 2022E FCF, falling to 33x 2023E FCF (vs. peers on 36x 2022E / 22x 2023E).

SANT GY,SANT,Dec 28 2021 08:03AM,S&T AG,Technology Hardware,S&T releases official comment on shortseller report ,"S&T released on Tuesday its detailed comment on the 16 December shortsellerreport, which sent the share price down by ~30% on this day. In the meantime, as many of the allegations look not related to S&T AG and/or are not material, the share price has recovered. On Tuesday, shares struggled to continue on the route of recovery as we believe investors may be considering company- independent voices with respect to allegations. However, we think that this is too early. Management has announced to have employed Deloitte to provide forensic examination in particular on the so-called ‘off balance-sheet entities' (OBE - minority participations, accounted for at cost). Many elements elaborated on in S&T's official comment are in line with our takeaways of our discussion with S&T's CFO just recently (link to note). Relative to this, what could be considered new information today, is the topic around S&T Serbia, which, we think, requires additional flesh to the bone. While we believe this can hardly be meaningful for the whole S&T group, additional background should support reinstalling investor trust. We continue to wait in particular for the results of the forensic examination. In general, we welcome S&T having announced further measures today to improve governance and transparency. Management confirmed the 2021 outlook again today and continues with the sale of the IT Services division as planned. ","Two points for us particularly worth taking a look in the official comment OBE: S&T has completed the sale of the historic 5% stake in Sandt Holding and is in the process of ceasing the trademark license agreement with Sandt Holding / S&T Ukraine. The Deloitte forensic investigation as announced will investigate the alleged off balance sheet-structures as well as clarify on potential further OBE structures (the latter is denied by management). Furthermore, the investigation should reveal S&T's level of business activity with OBE's (management: none today with respect to IMG China, minor sales of <€100k with subsidiaries of Sandt Holding until 2019). S&T Serbia: Management admits that it is sued by the Serbian state for non-delivery of goods and services. It adds however that S&T has sued the Serbian state for not paying outstanding amounts (we note that Serbia stood for 3% of sales of the IT Services division in 2020, i.e. €17m of revenue, or about and equivalent of 1.4% of the S&T group). S&T announces further steps to improve governance and transparency In addition to the forensic examination by Deloitte, management stated that an external, independent expert will be appointed by the Supervisory Board of S&T AG as Chief Compliance Officer, who will in future be responsible for the topics of law, compliance and corporate governance on the S&T Executive Board. Furthermore, S&T intends to continue reducing the complexity of the corporate structure and, as already announced, the appointment of a new auditor. Here, it was mentioned that the Supervisory Board should propose to the AGM next year that KPMG will be appointed as the new auditor from FY 22. Beyond this, management does not see the risk to be excluded from future public tender offers with respect to bidding on projects.",Adrian Pehl,"Adrian Pehl, CFA",30,,Buy,,EUR,0.9,,1.35,,0.19,0.3,,,,,M,STIFEL_S&T releases_FlashCoNote_Dec 28 2021 08-03AM.pdf,STIFEL_S&T releases_FlashCoNote_Dec 28 2021 08-03AM,FLASH NOTE,https://stifel.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=1c709432-4f4c-406e-9ebf-0897a590461f&mime=pdf&co=Stifel&id=donnert@a-s-capital.com&source=libraryView
TEP FP,TEP,Dec 29 2021 01:00AM,Teleperformance,Business Services,Acquisition in U.S. government services ,"Teleperformance announced the acquisition of BPO company Senture. Itspecializes in contact center outsourcing services for the U.S. government. The considered EV is $400m implying a 13x EV/EBITA 2021E transaction multiple, well below TEP's own trading valuation. We expect low- to mid- single-digit upside to consensus 2022E EPS. Most importantly, we think this acquisition should open new growth opportunities for TEP with the U.S. government. Overall, it supports higher organic growth over the mid-term, and confirms the group's capacity to close strategic accretive deals. ","Senture ata glance: the company generates $192m of revenue (2021E) by providing contact center support services. The U.S. government (federal, state, or local) represents 80% of Senture's activity. The remaining 20% are mostly generated with commercial healthcare. Senture employs >4,500 people onshore, o/w c.85% are working from home. TEP reports that Senture's revenue growth and EBITA margin (c.16%) stand above TEP's. Strengthening the ‘citizen lines of services' in the U.S.: The group already successfully supports European governments: visas outsourcing (TLS) and COVD-19 support services. TEP is currently in a bidding process for significant visa outsourcing contacts in the U.S. This acquisition expands TEP's capacities, and Senture could become a platform for further growth and cross-selling with the U.S. government. We thus expect Senture to deliver revenue synergies and support higher organic growth going forward. Inexpensive cost of financing: TEP mentioned that the acquisition was financed through debt. The group notably issued a €500m bond with 0.25% coupon in November 2021. This bond had been raised to ""meet the company's general financing needs and to refinance the Health Advocate acquisition"". We could thus expect that TEP uses this bond to finance the deal, implying no additional financial costs (excluding the M&A transaction costs). Expected financial impact: we estimate that the acquisition implies c.2.5% upward revision to consensus revenue and EBITA, based on Senture's 2021E financials. This number could be higher based on expected revenue growth for Senture and potential revenue synergies. TEP guides for 5% accretive impact to EPS. We assume that this supports our view that the deal should not generate significant additional financial costs.
